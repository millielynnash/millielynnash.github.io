The statistical association between two variables measured at ordinal, interval or ratio level. Many different 'correlation co-efficients' are used as measures of association. We already know many ways to represent the association between two variables, both measured on at least an interval scale. Scatterplot
Covariance sxy = (‚àëi = 1n (x1 - x-bar)(yi - y-bar)) √∑ n - 1 (ùúéxy for population)
Pearson correlation coefficient rxy = (sxy) √∑ (sxsy) (ùúåxy for population) The correlation reflects the noisiness and direction of a linear relationship, but not the slope of that relationship, nor many aspects of non-linear relationships. <img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).webp" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).webp" target="_self">
To test whether the sample correlation between x and y is significantly different from zero (non-directional): H0: ùúå = 0 vs. H1: ùúå ‚â† 0 Directional alternatives are also possible. Assumptions: Linearity: The Pearson correlation assumes that the relationship among x and y is a linear relationship. Independence: Units or cases are randomly sampled from the population. tobs = r‚àö(n - 2) √∑ (1 - r2)
tcrit: Given the ùõº level, t distribution with degrees of freedom (df = n - 2)
Reject H0 if tobs &gt; tcrit (or for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit)
Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; ùõº
APA Style Writing Template: A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the linear relationship between x and y. There was a (weak / moderate / strong negative / positive) correlation between x and y, r (df) = (p-value). Notice: No need to report t. Restricting the range of scores on one or both variables will reduce the strength of a correlation. If the size of the standard deviation for one variable is reduced, everything else being equal, then the size of correlations with other variables will also be reduced. In other words, we need sufficient variation for a relationship to be evidenced through the correlation coefficient value.
HS GPA and ACT example: The strength of correlation between GPA and ACT will be lessened if we only focus on the graduates with summa cum laude (weighted GPA 4.2 or above). Correlation means the variables are related in some way, but correlations alone should not be used to infer cause. A high correlation between x and y might be a result of: x causes y
y causes x
A third variable z is causing both x and y (or even more variables are involved). Causality is not easy to prove. Application of complex statistical methods is not evidence for causality!
Causation (x -&gt; y) can only be inferred (formalized by the 19 th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill) if: x proceeded y
x was related to y
We can find no other plausible alternative explanation for the effect on y other than x. 'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ¬± .2 (weak)
r = ¬± .4 (moderate)
r = ¬± .8 (strong)
It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ¬± .1 (weak)
r = ¬± .3 (moderate)
r = ¬± .5 (strong) Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. You will learn regression models with multiple predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), in more advanced stats classes. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. <br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ‚âà .487
This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA. Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
Recall 'ballpark' effect size: Weak (|r| ‚â• .2) Weak (r2 ‚â• .04 or 4%) Moderate (|r| ‚â• .4) Moderate (r2 ‚â• .16 or 16%) Strong (|r| ‚â• .8) Strong (r2 ‚â• .64 or 64%) xi: IV data point for subject i
yi: DV data point for subject i
yi: Expected/predicted value for subject i (i.e., the regression line)

The slope is determined by the correlation between x and y with a scale of y per change in x. Analyze -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear
Define DV and IV (one IV for SLR)
Usually you'd already review descriptive statistics and correlations before running a regression, but you can also ask SPSS to report Descriptive in the Statistics option. Many other options are for MLR only. The default SPSS output has 3 sections: Model Summary (How much variance in DV is explained by the model)
ANOVA Table (Model significance)
Regression Coefficients (Equation for the regression line) Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts: What we can explain by the model (regression)
What we still cannot explain (error) Regression sum of squares (SSR)
Error Sum of Squares (SSE)
Total Sum of Squares (SSTO)
SSTO = SSR + SSE
SSR, SSE, and SSTO are available in the ANOVA table R2 indicates the proportion of variance in DV explained (accounted for) by the model, which can be considered the overall model fit. R2 = (SSR) √∑ (SSTO) = 1 - (SSE √∑ SSTO) = (Multiple R)2 In SLR, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation between x and y Multiple R is the correlation between yi and y-hati (always positive) In SLR, Multiple R = | rxy | Omnibus: Comprising several items
"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package." The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually Œ±=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: Œ≤1 = 0
H1: Œ≤1 ‚â† 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: œÅ = 0 (œÅ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: œÅ &gt; 0
H0: œÅ2 = 0
H1: œÅ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; Œ±
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br><a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>

Literally, 'something for something,' an equal exchange or substitution.

Lederer &amp; Jackson proposed The Quid Pro Quo contract as an implicit contract that every relationship contains. It is a contract in which people exchange positive things with one another. They suggested this kind of reciprocity breaks down in relationships that are ailing, and trust becomes eroded. In 1977 Bernard Murstein found that quid-pro-quo way of thinking was characteristic of both ailing friendships and relationships. Once a partner becomes an emotional 'accountant' there is something wrong. (i.e., when the thinking is, "I did this for that person and it never got reciprocated,"), then that is a sign that the relationship is in trouble. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/quid-pro-quo.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Quid Pro Quo.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Psychoeducational Family Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

In other words, the moderator influences how, or under what conditions, the IV affects the DV. Helps determine under what conditions or for whom an effect holds true. Imagine you are studying the impact of a training program (IV) on job performance (DV). However, you hypothesize that this relationship differs based on work experience (moderator). For individuals with high work experience, the training might have a stronger (or weaker) effect on performance compared to those with low work experience. In this case, work experience moderates the effect of training on job performance. <br>When conducting moderation analysis (typically through <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a> with an interaction term).

Look for a straight-line relationship between each predictor and the DV. <br>Run your <a data-href="Regression Analysis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/regression/regression-analysis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Regression Analysis</a> Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear
In the Linear Regression dialog, click Plots. Move the standardized predicted values on the X box and standardized residuals to the Y box. Click Continue and then OK. Check the plot for a random scatter (no obvious patterns or curves) which supports the linearity assumption. The variance of residuals should be consistent across levels of the predictors. Use the same plot created for checking linearity. Look for a consistent spread of residuals across all predicted values (no funnel shape or systematic change in spread). You can also use tests like the Breusch-Pagan test in SPSS (via additional syntax or plugins) if a more formal assessment is needed. Residuals from the regression should be approximately normally distributed. After running your regression, save the standardized residuals. Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram and plot the residuals. The histogram should show a bell-shaped curve. In the regression dialog (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), Click Plots.
Add a Normal Q-Q plot by moving the standardized residuals to the Y box. A Q-Q plot where the points closely follow the diagonal line indicates that the residuals are normally distributed. <br>The observations should be independent of each other (i.e., no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>) Ensure that your data collection method supports the assumption of independence (e.g., participants are sampled independently) When running the regression (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), SPSS outputs the Durbin-Watson statistic.
A value around 2 suggests that the residuals are independent. Values deviating substantially from 2 indicate potential issues. Predictor variables (including the interaction term) should not be too highly correlated. <br>Ensure that variables are centered (or standardized) to reduce <a data-href="Multicollinearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multicollinearity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multicollinearity</a> when creating interaction terms. <br>Multiply the centered <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a> and <a data-href="Moderator" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/moderator.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Moderator</a>.

<br>Enter the IV, moderator, and the interaction term as <a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a> s. For moderation analysis, use Model 1. PROCESS automatically creates the interaction term (Training x Work Experience)
If your variables are continuous, it is often recommended to center them first (or use PROCESS options that center them automatically) IV and Moderator Coefficients: These represent the effect of the IV and moderator on the DV when the other variable is at its mean (if centered). Interaction Coefficient (IV √ó Moderator): Significance: A statistically significant interaction term (typically p &lt; .05) indicates that the effect of the IV on the DV changes depending on the level of the moderator.
Interpretation: If the coefficient is positive, as the moderator increases, the effect of the IV on the DV becomes stronger (or more positive); if negative, the effect weakens (or becomes more negative). Purpose: To determine how the IV-DV relationship varies at specific values of the moderator (e.g., at the mean, one standard deviation above, and one standard deviation below the mean).
Output: SPSS (via PROCESS) often provides these slopes along with their confidence intervals and p-values. Suppose you get the following (hypothetical) output:
IV (Training): b = 0.30, SE = 0.10, p = .003
Moderator (Work Experience): b = 0.20, SE = 0.08, p =.012
Interaction (Training √ó Work Experience): b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002 The significant interaction (p = .002) suggests that the effect of training on job performance depends on work experience.
A simple slopes analysis might reveal that for individuals with high work experience (e.g., +1 SD), the effect of training on performance is stronger (say, b=0.45b = 0.45b=0.45) compared to those with low work experience (e.g., -1 SD, b=0.15b = 0.15b=0.15). Below is an example of how you might report your findings in APA style:
A moderation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 1) to examine whether work experience moderated the relationship between training and job performance. The results indicated a significant interaction between training and work experience, b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002, suggesting that the effect of training on job performance varied as a function of work experience. Simple slopes analysis revealed that the relationship between training and job performance was stronger for participants with high work experience (b = 0.45, p &lt; .001) compared to those with low work experience (b = 0.15, p = .045). These findings indicate that work experience significantly moderates the relationship between training and job performance.

A covariate is an <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> that is not the primary focus of your research but is included in the analysis because it might influence the <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>. In other words, it is a variable that you control for to help isolate the effect of your main <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable(s)</a>. Covariates are used to adjust for variables that might confound the relationship between your main predictors and the outcome. For example, if you're studying the effect of a new teaching method on exam scores, you might include prior GPA as a covariate to account for baseline academic ability. By accounting for variability in the dependent variable that is due to covariates, you can reduce the error variance. This improves the precision of your estimates and increases the statistical power of your tests. Including covariates can help provide a clearer picture of the relationship between your primary variables of interest and the outcome, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. In analyses like ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance), covariates are used to adjust the means of the groups so that comparisons are made at a common level of the covariate. Imagine you're evaluating the effectiveness of a training program (the primary independent variable) on job performance (the dependent variable). However, work experience (the covariate) might also affect job performance. By including work experience as a covariate, you control for its effect, allowing you to more accurately determine the impact of the training program on job performance.

An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" target="_self"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File
Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/Testing for Normality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:33:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structural Equation Modeling]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Structural equation modeling Thumbnail" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Example_Structural_equation_model.svg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">

Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>.

HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ‚âà .487

Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film.

"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package." The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually Œ±=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: Œ≤1 = 0
H1: Œ≤1 ‚â† 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: œÅ = 0 (œÅ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: œÅ &gt; 0
H0: œÅ2 = 0

However, temperature measured in Kelvin is a ratio variable as 0 Kelvin (often called absolute zero) indicates that there is no temperature whatsoever. Other examples of ratio variables include height, mass, distance, etc. The name 'ratio' reflects the fact that you can use the ratio of measurements.

For negative emotion change (hypothesized to decrease), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = -2.393, p = .011. The mean difference is -0.20 (negative emotion decreased after watching the video). The 95% upper confidence limit -. 0585 below zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly smaller than 0).
For positive emotion change (hypothesized to increase), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The mean difference is 1.06 (positive emotion increased after watching the video). The 95% lower confidence limit .7809 above zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly greater than 0). tobs = d √∑ sd-bar or d √∑ (sd √∑ ‚àön) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - ¬µ0) (s √∑ ‚àön)
Where is ¬µ0? Given ùõº level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).
Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; ùõº (SPSS) ùõº level is usually .05 (95% confidence level) Nondirectional: 100 (1 - ùõº)% CI: ¬± tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar ¬± tdf, ùõº/2 x (sd-bar √∑ ‚àön) To test greater (significant increase in post-scores): 100 (1 - ùõº)% LCL: - tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores): 100 (1 - ùõº)% UCL: + tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS

Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. Paired Samples StatisticsPaired Samples CorrelationsPaired Samples Test
For negative emotion change: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön = .48742 √∑ ‚àö34 = .08359
tobs = d-bar √∑ sd = - .2000 √∑ .08359 = -2.393 For positive emotion change: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön = .95754 √∑ ‚àö34 = .16422
tobs = d-bar √∑ sd = 1.05882 √∑ .16422 = 6.448 Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to decrease (one-tailed test). H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â• 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &lt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = - .2000, SD sd = .48742, sd-bar = .08359
tobs = -2.393, df = 33, p = .011
Since the p-value (. 011) is smaller than the ùõº level (. 05), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' negative emotion significantly decreased after watching the cat videos. Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to increase (one-tailed test). H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â§ 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &gt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = 1.05882, SD sd = .95754, sd-bar = .16422
tobs = 6.448, df = 33, p &lt; .001
Since the p-value is very small (&lt; .001), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' positive emotion significantly increased after watching the cat videos. Cohen's d = d-bar √∑ sd-bar Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test: d = ( - ¬µ0) √∑ s Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ¬±0.2: Small effect
d = ¬±0.5: Medium effect
d = ¬±0.8: Large effect Paired Samples Effect Sizes
For negative emotion change, Cohen's d (- 0.410) suggests a small to medium effect. For positive emotion change, the effect size (d = 1.106) is quite large. The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The results from the pre-test (M = 13.5, SD = 2.4) and post-test (M = 16.2, SD = 2.7) memory task indicate that the presence of caffeine in the bloodstream resulted in an improvement in memory recall, t(19) = 3.1, p = .006. There was a significant increase in the volume of alcohol consumed in the week after the end of semester (M = 8.7, SD = 3.1) compared to the week before the end of semester (M = 3.2, SD = 1.5), t(52) = 4.8, p &lt; .001

If your t-test is one-tailed, you need to say so. It's preferred to report the exact p-value unless it's smaller than .001. You need to state your alpha level (usually .05) early in the results section. If your p-value is smaller than .001, it's conventional simply to state p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)
Remember to drop the leading 0 from the p-value. No need to provide a formula for observed t in your paper. Observations are from a random sample, and the scores are independent of each other. Dependent variable of interest is measured on at least an interval scale. Difference scores (d's) are normally distributed. Typically considered robust to violations of non-normality, especially for big sample (n &gt; 30)
If one of the samples is highly skewed (particularly for a one-tailed test), a lot of error will tend to be built into the difference scores. Other non-parametric analyses would be better alternatives. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/paired-t-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/Paired T-Test.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:31:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Values for the F statistic should all be positive. F = 1 means no mean difference because the between and within group variabilities would be the same. The higher your F, the greater change of it being significant (would mean there is a much higher variability between groups than you see within groups) Complete F Table Compare the calculated F-value against the F-crit value If F-value is greater than F-crit then you can say there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups. When looking at the F-crit table, the df between is horizontal and df within is vertical. Make a Decision Write up the F-values (i.e., F (1,10) = 41.227, p &lt; .001). A bar graph can be used to visually depict the differences as well. Example Language: "We conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine whether there was a mean difference of depression scores between subjects who were diagnosed with depression and who were not. The ANOVA results showed that there was a statistically significant mean difference between the two groups (F (1,22) = 117.42, p &lt; .001)." The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-4.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-4.png" target="_self">
Where ¬µ = group mean and k = number of groups. If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which is that there are at least two group means that are statistically significantly different from each other. The one-way ANOVA is an Omnibus test statistic, and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test. It is used to test research questions and hypotheses where you want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single dependent variable. You are asking if there is a significant difference between the groups based on a single categorical independent variable with multiple levels. If you are dealing with individuals, you are likely to encounter this situation using two different types of study design: One study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then randomly split this group into three or more smaller groups (i.e., each participant is allocated to one, and only one, group). You then get each group to undertake different tests (or put them under different conditions) and measure the outcome/response on the same dependent variable. For example, a researcher wishes to know whether different pacing strategies affect the time to complete a marathon. The researcher randomly assigns a group of volunteers to either a group that (a) starts slow and then increases their speed, (b) starts fast and slows down or (c) runs at a steady pace throughout. The time to complete the marathon is the outcome (dependent) variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-5.png" target="_self"> A second study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then split them into groups based on some independent variable. Again, each individual will be assigned to one group only. This independent variable is sometimes called an attribute independent variable because you are splitting the group based on some attribute that they possess (e.g., their level of education; every individual has a level of education, even if it is 'none'). Each group is then measured on the same dependent variable having undergone the same task or condition (or none at all). For example, a researcher is interested in determining whether there are differences in leg strength between amateur, semi-professional and provessional rugby players. The force/strength measured on an isokinetic machine is the dependent variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-6.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-6.png" target="_self"> <br>Every time you conduct a t-test there is a chance that you will make a <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. This error is usually 5%. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of "making a mistake" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests. However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors. An ANOVA controls for these errors so that the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> remains at 5% and you can be more confident that any statistically significant result you find is not just running lots of tests. When you choose to analyze your data using a one-way ANOVA, part of the process involves checking to make sure that the data you want to analyze can actually be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a one-way ANOVA if your data "passes" six assumptions that are required for a one-way ANOVA to give you a valid result. <br>Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (<a data-href="Interval Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Interval Variable</a> and <a data-href="Ratio Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratio Variable</a>) (i.e., they are <a data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous Variable</a>; IQ score, exam scores, weight, etc).
The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group that is being compared in the one-way ANOVA (technically, it is the residuals that need to be normally distributed, but the results will be the same). <br>For example, if we were comparing three groups (e.g., amateur, semi-professional, and professional rugby players) on their leg strength, their leg strength values (<a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>) would have to be normally distributed for the amateur group of players, normally distributed for the semi-professionals and normally distributed for the professional player. You can test for normality in SPSS. <br><a data-href="Testing for Normality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Testing for Normality</a> There is homogeneity of variances. This means that the population variances in each group are equal. If you use SPSS Statistics, Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances is included in the output when you run a one-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics. <br><a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>. This is mostly a study design issue and, as such, you will need to determine whether you believe it is possible that your observations are not independent based on your study design. <br>Your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Typically, a one-way ANOVA is used when you have three or more categorical, independent groups, but it can be used for just two groups (but an <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> is more commonly used for two groups)
Example independent variables that meet this criterion include ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate, and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist) and so forth. <br>You should have <a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. For example, there must be different participants in each group with no participant being in more than one group. This is more of a study design issue than something you can test for. If your study fails this assumption, you will need to use another statistical test instead of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., a repeated measures design). There should be no significant outliers. Outliers are simply data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern (e.g., in a study of 100 students' IQ scores, where the mean score was 108 with only a small variation between students, one student had a score of 156, which is very unusual, and may even put her in the top 1% of IQ scores globally). The problem with outliers is that they can have a negative effect on the one-way ANOVA, reducing the validity of your results. <br>Your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. We talk about the one-way ANOVA only requiring approximately normal data because it is quite 'robust' to violations of normality, meaning that assumption can be a little violated and still provide valid results. You can test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which is easily tested for using SPSS Statistics. <br>There needs to be <a data-href="Homogeneity of Variances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/homogeneity-of-variances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homogeneity of Variances</a>. You can test this assumption in SPSS Statistics using Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If your data fails this assumption, you will need to not only carry out a Welch ANOVA instead of a one-way ANOVA, which you can do using SPSS Statistics, but also use a different post hoc test. <br>The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options: Transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed
Choose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality. There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated. Welch
Brown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you can run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most situations, it has been shown that the Welch test is the best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in SPSS. A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumptions to fail. Often, there is little you can do that offers a good solution to this problem. Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-Way ANOVA<br>

However, you will probably also want to report means ¬± <a data-href="Standard Deviation (SD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviation-(sd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Standard Deviation (SD)</a> s for your groups, as well as follow up a statistically significant result with a post hoc test. The general form of writing the result of a one-way ANOVA is as follow:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-7.png" target="_self">
You should not report the result as 'Significant difference,' but instead report it as 'statistically significant difference.' this is because your devision as to whether the result is significant or not should not be based solely on your statistical test. Report the result of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., 'There were no statistically significant differences between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 1.397, p = .15)'). Running a post hoc test is usually not warranted and should not be carried out. You need to report your results. You then need to follow-up the one-way ANOVA by running a post hoc test. You need to perform the same procedures as above, but add into your results section that this assumption was violated and you needed to run a Welch F test. ANOVA test tells you whether you have an overall difference between your groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups differed - post hoc tests do. Because post hoc tests are run to confirm where the differences occurred between groups, they should only be run when you have a shown an overall statistically significant difference in group means (i.e., a statistically significant one-way ANOVA result). Post hoc tests attempt to control the experiment-wise error rate (usually alpha = 0.05) in the same manner that the one-way ANOVA is used instead of multiple t-tests. Post hoc tests are termed a posteriori tests; that is, performed after the event (the event in this case being a study). There are a great number of different post hoc tests that you can use. However, you should only run one post hoc test - do not run multiple post hoc tests. For a one-way ANOVA, you will probably find that just two tests need to be considered. If your data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances, use Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. Note that if you use SPSS Statistics, Tukey's HSD test is simply referred to as 'Tukey' in the post post hoc multiple comparisons dialogue box. If your data did not meet the homogeneity fo variances assumption, you should consider running the Games Howell post hoc test. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/one-way-independent-anova.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/One-Way Independent ANOVA.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:31:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/one-way-anova.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/one-way-anova.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Multivariate Model]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The simple model (i.e., mean-only model) is not very informative and has a lot of error.
- Y = ùõΩ0 + ùúÄ
Our model-building goal is to improve prediction and thereby reduce the error. To improve prediction and reduce error, we add a predictor variable (X) to the model. This enhanced model is the beginning of a 'predictive formula' that predicts individual outcome variable scores (Y) better than just predicting the mean. To use a bivariate regression model, identify two types of variables: <br><a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a>, or known variable (x)

The estimate of the population parameter, which we calculate using our sample data, is designated by the Arabic letter b. We can predict a person's score on an outcome (dependent) variable (Y-Hat) based on what we know about that person's score on a predictor (independent) variable (x). If variables x and y are related to each other, then adding x to our model improves prediction and produces less error (SSE) than the simple model generated. Here we have two competing models: You can use bivariate regression to answer the following questions about the pattern of data points and the significance of a linear equation: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?
Which equation of a straight line can best describe this pattern?
Are the predictions made from this equation significant? More questions using Bivariate Regression: What is the nature of the relation between x and y?
Is b statistically significant? What is the Confidence Interval for b. What is the effect size?
How is the y variance partitioned between explained and unexplained?
Do plots of residuals indicate violations of assumptions for bivariate linear regression? The error produced by Model C is the most error a parametric model can have. Thus, we often call this model as the simplest or null model.
<br>We call the sum of squared errors generated by Model C the <a data-href="Sum of Squares Total (SST)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares Total (SST)</a>.
We call the sum of squared errors by Model A SSEA. SST is almost always greater than SSEA. SST = SSEA + SSR Y-Hat = b0 + b1X Y-Hat: Predicted value of Y
b0: Intercept, the value of Y when X = 0. b1: Slope, the change in Y relative to the change in X. We actually never know the true population value of parameter Œ≤; we only estimate with our data. Yi = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1Xi + ùúÄi We will calculate b1 first. Determine b0 and using b1.

To estimate the error generated by this augmented model (SSEA) we need to Predict a score on Y for each subject. Find the difference between each subject's predicted and actual scores on Y. Square the differences. Add them up. Y = 10.268 - .776x + ùúÄ <br><img alt="3. Bivariate Regression-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/3.-bivariate-regression-3.png" target="_self"> It is difficult to judge is an error reduction of 64.383 is a lot or a little. To help us get a sense of how much error we reduced, we express this reduction in error as a percentage of the total error (SST).
The regression model explained .805 (80.5%, effect size) of the original SST in variable Y. <br><img alt="3.

Since the mean of Y was 6, ùõΩ0 = 6. The intercept, ùõΩ0, is the predicted value of Y when X is zero. Thus, if X has no meaningful value of 0, the estimated intercept is not informative. Centering the predictor of X to its mean can generate a better estimate because then the estimated ùõΩ0 is now the predictor value of Y when the predictor X is its mean. Think about the 1 st year college CPA as the outcome (Y) predicted by the SAT score (X).

Y = 10.268 - .776 X + ùúÄ

This new regression equation shows the exact same relationship between Y and X' as we found for Y and X. If you calculate the error of this regression model, you will get the exact same SSEA Allows us to answer the following: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?

VIF = 1&nbsp;‚Üí No collinearity.
VIF between 1 and 5&nbsp;‚Üí Moderate collinearity (acceptable).
VIF &gt; 10&nbsp;‚Üí High collinearity (problematic, requires corrective action). A high VIF suggests that one independent variable is highly correlated with others, making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.
<br>You can calculate VIF in SPSS using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Linear Regression</a>:
Click&nbsp;Analyze&nbsp;‚Üí&nbsp;Regression&nbsp;‚Üí&nbsp;Linear.
Specify Variables: Move the dependent variable to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box.
Move the independent variables to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box. Enable Collinearity Diagnostics: Click&nbsp;Statistics.
Check&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tolerance/VIF.
Click&nbsp;Continue. Run the Analysis:&nbsp;Click&nbsp;OK. The&nbsp;Coefficients Table&nbsp;in SPSS will include two relevant columns: Tolerance: The proportion of variance in a predictor not explained by the other predictors (Tolerance = 1/VIF).
VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): The degree to which variance is inflated due to multicollinearity. If&nbsp;VIF &lt; 5, multicollinearity is not a major concern.
If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 5, review the correlation between predictors.
If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 10, severe multicollinearity exists, and corrective action (e.g., removing variables, combining correlated variables, or using Principal Component Analysis) may be needed. "A multiple regression was conducted to predict Y based on X1, X2, and X3. The VIF values were examined for multicollinearity, with all values below 5, indicating no severe multicollinearity concerns (X1 VIF = 1.18, X2 VIF = 3.12, X3 VIF = 11.11). However, X3 showed high collinearity (VIF &gt; 10), suggesting a need for further analysis or model revision."

A statistical procedure designed to assess whether differences in the means of two groups reflect differences in their respective populations or are simply due to chance. Non-directional (two-tailed): To test if mean where sample came from (¬µ) is significantly different from hypothesized mean (¬µ0). H0: ¬µ = ¬µ0 vs. H1: ¬µ ‚â† ¬µ0 Alternatively in terms of mean difference: H0: ¬µ - ¬µ0 = 0 vs. H1: ¬µ - ¬µ0 ‚â† 0 Directional (One-Tailed): H0: ¬µ ‚â§ ¬µ0 vs. H1: ¬µ &gt; ¬µ0
H0: ¬µ ‚â• ¬µ0 vs. H1: ¬µ &lt; ¬µ0 Reject H0 if tobs = (x bar - ¬µ0) √∑ (s √∑ ‚àön) falls into the critical region (determined by tcrit given the df) Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-sample t-test Pick variable and enter the Test Value (¬µ0) SPSS reports p-values for both one-sided (directional) and two-sided (non-directional) tests. However, confidence interval (CI) of mean difference is only constructed for two-sided. <img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-3.png" target="_self"> Set up hypotheses based on the research question. Where does the sample/observed mean lie on the sampling distribution?
Given the confidence level 100 (1 - ùúé)%, what is considered extreme evidence?
Compared to the critical value, is the sample mean extreme enough to be considered different from ¬µ0? For one-sample t-test (population œÉ unknown), we use Cohen‚Äôs d to report effect size.
Cohen‚Äôs d = (x bar - Œº0) √∑ s Recall Cohen‚Äôs d for one-sample z-test: d = (x bar - Œº0) √∑ ùúé So, here sample SD (ùúé) is used to estimate ùúé.
Notice, unlike z or t scores, effect sizes are not affected by sample size Size of Cohen's d (by convention): Small effect: d = ¬± 0.2 Medium effect: d = ¬± 0.5 Large effect: d = ¬± 0.8 SPSS reports both one-sided and two-sided p-values, but only two-sided CI is reported. To obtain one-sided upper or lower confidence limits, run a test doubling the ùõº (alpha) level This doe snot affect the p-values reported in the output. Say if you are conducting a directional test a 95% confidence level and want to see LCL or UCL, you can change the confidence interval percentage from 95% to 90% in Options. The lower end of reported 90% CI would be 95% LCL (Lower Control Limit), and the upper end of reported 90% CI would be 95% (Upper Control Limit). Any variation detected inside the control limits probably occurred by chance. On the other hand, variation outside of the control limits likely occurred due to special causes. The upper control limit (UCL) and the&nbsp;lower control limit&nbsp;(LCL) serve as boundaries for expected deviation in data.

The null hypothesis stated that WTP would not differ from the retail price. The alternative hypothesis stated that WTP would differ from the retail price.
Based on a random sample of 20 OSU students, there was a mean WTP of $181.9 and a standard deviation of $231.215. Then compared against the hypothesized mean of $899, the one-sample t-test was statistically significant, t(19) = -13.87, p &lt; .001, indicating WTP is significantly different from $899.
In addition, the effect size Cohen‚Äôs d was -3.101, generally interpreted as a large effect (Cohen, 1988), indicating that there is about 3 standard deviations difference between WTP and retail price, with the WTP lower than the retail price. <br><a data-href="7.

Directional: Test if post-score (¬µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (¬µ1). H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â§ 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &gt; 0 Directional: Test if post-score (¬µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (¬µ1): H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â• 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &lt; 0 tobs = d √∑ sd-bar or d √∑ (sd √∑ ‚àön) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - ¬µ0) (s √∑ ‚àön)
Where is ¬µ0? Given ùõº level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).

Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. Cohen's d = d-bar √∑ sd-bar Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test: d = ( - ¬µ0) √∑ s Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ¬±0.2: Small effect
d = ¬±0.5: Medium effect
d = ¬±0.8: Large effect The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. Used for questions about whether the population standard mean (¬µ) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (¬µ0).
Non-directional (two-sided) or directional (one-sided)
Population standard deviation (ùúé) is unknown: estimated by sample standard deviation (s).
Assumptions: Observations come from a random sample, and subjects are independent of each other. Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30). <br><a data-href="P-Value" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/p-value.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">P-Value</a>

Sampling is the process of selecting a given number of units of analysis from a population. Although in social research these units are often individuals, they do not need to be but could be households, firms, countries, or whatever. Sampling is often based on randomness to ensure representativeness, although non-random sampling might be used in some circumstances. <a data-href="Access" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Access</a>

A statistical method analyzing the linear relationship between an interval level dependent variable and two or more independent variables. Predicts a continuous dependent variable using multiple independent variables.
Example:&nbsp;Predicting exam scores based on study hours and attendance. Analyze ‚Üí Regression ‚Üí Linear.
Move your&nbsp;dependent variable&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box and predictors to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box.
Click&nbsp;Statistics&nbsp;and select&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Durbin‚ÄìWatson.

Interpretation:&nbsp;A significant F (p &lt; .001) indicates the model fits significantly better than one with no predictors. Interpretation:&nbsp;Both predictors are significant. VIF values are acceptable (&lt;10). The Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic (not shown here) should be near 2.

How to Check Plot residuals vs. Predicted values
Look for a random scatter.
In SPSS: Request Linear Regression Plots. Y &gt; ZPred
X &gt; Z Resid
If the scatterplot shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met. <br><img alt="Testing Homoscedasticity Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-homoscedasticity-example.png" target="_self"> Example Check if the spread of residuals is consistent across predicted house prices. Solution Apply transformations or use weighted least squares. An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <br><img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" target="_self"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File
Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above. Utilize Cook's Distance under the 'Residuals Statistics' Table<br>
<img alt="Testing for Extreme Outliers.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-extreme-outliers.png" target="_self">
If the maximum Cook's distance is below 1.0, then the assumption is met.
Other tests may give a different cutoff point, but for our purposes we will use 1.0. <br>Observations are independent of each other (no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>)
How to Check Use the Durbin-Watson test. If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 - 2.5, the assumption is met. Examples <br><img alt="Testing the Independence of Error.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-the-independence-of-error.png" target="_self"> For this example, we'll say 1.482 is close enough to 1.5 and the assumption is met.

A method of statistical inference named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English mathematician. The method involves working backwards from effect to cause, by estimating the conditional probability of a cause given that certain events have occurred. Bayesian inference involves using new information, called the posterior probability, to revise earlier estimates of probability, called <a data-href="Prior Probability" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/prior-probability.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prior Probability</a>. <br><a data-href="Bayers' Theorem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/theory/bayers'-theorem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bayers' Theorem</a>

Many statistical procedures depend on the assumption that modelling errors are independent of one other. In the xontext of time-series research designs where, for example, repeated observations are made of the same entity such as an individual or country, this assumption is often not met. Where this occurs the errors are said to be autocorrelated. <a data-href="Heteroscedasticity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/heteroscedasticity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Heteroscedasticity</a>

Biases can be neutral, positive, or negative. Operating outside our conscious awareness. Based on inaccurate information or stereotypes. Implicit biases can impact our decisions, perceptions, and behaviors. Actions and decisions resulting from our biases create real world barriers to equity and opportunity. It is so important to learn about implicit bias, particularly those biases that don't align with your intentions or explicit beliefs. Implicit bias does NOT refer to those beliefs we conceal or suppress in an effort to appear non-biased.

Teachers with strong, implicit pro-White biases were more likely to take a 'teach-to-the-test' approach. Discipline decisions are challenging and stressful for everyone involved. Differences in discipline show up strongly with regards to race and gender. Subjective or ambiguous situations can activate implicit associations. Students of color are more likely to receive disciplinary measures for 'disruptive behavior', 'disrespect', and 'excessive noise.'
Culturally-influenced perceptions of student behavior. Implicit bias can turn even our best intentions into unwanted outcomes. Research is growing around the role of implicit bias in limiting opportunities. The race, gender, and program affiliation of the professor did not have an overall impact on the response. They responded better to White men. It is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to uncover our implicit biases through introspection. There are two ways to measure implicit biases: Examining our behavior
Neurological measurement Medical brain scanning technology Tools like fMRIs and the IAT are often utilized together. These associations can spill over into concepts unrelated to the 'prime'

Culturally humble therapists rarely assume competence. Requires the therapist to engage in self-reflection and self-critique. Ability to express respect and lack of superiority even when cultural differences threatened to weaken alliance. Approach clients with respectful openness, and work collaboratively with clients to understand the unique intersection of clients' various aspects of identities. It is a disposition rather than a competency per se. "Culturally humble therapists not only strive to be effective but also cultivate a growing awareness that they are inevitably limited in their knowledge and understanding of a client's cultural background, which motivates them to interpersonally attune themselves to the client in a quest to understand the individual client's cultural background and experience."
Developed a measure of cultural humility from client's perspective, found that it was associated with alliance, and progress, added explained variance to alliance above and beyond cultural competence measure. Relational Ethics Perspective: Take responsibility for the way our communication shape others' understandings. Build relationships based on curiosity, openness, respect, and understanding of the mean making process. Participate in meaning making in ways that allow for creating inclusive positions. Understand how our positioning contributes to the creation of social reality. Transparently share our positions of power and their impact on moral decisions that are made, ideally collaboratively. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/ethics/ethics-and-cultural-awareness.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Ethics/Ethics and Cultural Awareness.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:25:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Worldview]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Any oppressive system has at its core the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. This idea gets elaborated in many ways - more intelligent, harder working, stronger, more capable, more noble, more deserving, more advanced, chosen, normal, superior, and so on. The dominant group holds this idea about itself. And, of course, the opposite qualities are attributed to the other group - stupid, lazy, weak, incompetent, worthless, less deserving, backward, abnormal, inferior, and so on. The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society - the laws, the legal system and police practice, the education system and schools, hiring policies, public policies, housing development, media images, political power, etc. When a woman makes two thirds of what a man makes in the same job, it is institutionalized sexism. When one out of every four African-American young men is currently in jail, on parole, or on probation, it is institutionalized racism. When psychiatric institutions and associations 'diagnose' transgender people as having a mental disorder, it is institutionalized gender oppression and transphobia. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. For example, if a policy unintentionally reinforces and creates new inequalities between privileged and non-privileged groups. The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close--the racist jokes, the stereotypes, the beatings and harassment, the threats, etc. Similarly, interpersonal sexism is what men do to women - the sexual abuse and harassment, the violence directed at women, the belittling or ignoring of women's thinking, the sexist jokes, etc. Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal. These kinds of oppressive attitudes and behaviors are backed up by the institutional arrangements. This helps to clarify the confusion around what some claim to be "reverse racism." People of color can have prejudices against and anger towards white people, or individual white people. They can act out those feelings in destructive and hurtful ways towards whites. But in almost every case, this acting out will be severely punished. The force of the police and the courts, or at least a gang of whites getting even, will come crashing down on those people of color. The individual prejudice of black people, for example, is not backed up by the legal system and prevailing white institutions. The oppressed group, therefore, does not have the power to enforce its prejudices, unlike the dominant group.
For example, the racist beating of Rodney King was carried out by the institutional force of the police, and upheld by the court system. This would not have happened if King had been white and the officers black. A simple definition of racism, as a system, is: RACISM = PREJUDICE + POWER. Therefore, with this definition of the systemic nature of racism, people of color cannot be racist. The same formula holds true for all forms of oppression. The dominant group has its mistreatment of the target group embedded in and backed up by society's institutions and other forms of power. The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change. Likewise, people who benefit the most from these systems internalize privilege. Privileged people involuntarily accept stereotypes and false assumptions about oppressed groups made by dominant culture. Internalized privilege includes acceptance of a belief in the inherent inferiority of the oppressed group as well as the inherent superiority or normalcy of one‚Äôs own privileged group. Internalized privilege creates an unearned sense of entitlement in members of the privileged group, and can be expressed as a denial of the existence of oppression and as paternalism. It should be clear that none of these four aspects of oppression can exist separately. As the diagram below suggests, each is completely mixed up with the others. It is crucial at see any oppression as a system. It should also be clear that trying to challenge oppression in any of the four aspects will affect the other three.

This occurs when social structures that create and organize different social groups, e.g., gender and race, interact ot produce effects that may not be intended. Example: Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/structural-intersectionality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Structural Intersectionality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social Location]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/social-location.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Social Location.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social Context]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/political-intersectionality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Political Intersectionality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paralanguage]]></title><description><![CDATA[

A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. While the 13th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries. We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community. We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/labor-acknowledgement.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Labor Acknowledgement.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kinesics]]></title><description><![CDATA[

A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/identity-politics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Identity Politics.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:23:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Identity Centrality]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The handbook used by health care professionals in the US and much of the world as the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders DSM contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders. It also provides a common language for researchers to study the criteria for potential future revisions and to aid in the development of medications and other interventions. Used universally with Guidelines for disorders
Not a 'perfect mirror of nature'
Imperfect because there is more to understand through research. Right now, it is a culmination of mental disorders, a dictionary used to communicate with administrators, clients, and clinicians. Provide a shared language among professionals and clients. Most up to date information to provide help and assistance
Clinical judgement, DSM is a 'part' of diagnosis. It must be used with clinical judgement. (What does 'clinical judgement' mean?)
We should not be using the DSM too rigidly, but providing the help our clients need. Problem: People who should take it least seriously is scientists. Cannot make the psychiatric progress clients need. 1840: Category 'insanity' first attempt to quantify and name psychiatric diagnoses 1844: APA published a predecessor of the DSM: A classification of institutionalized mental patients Early 1900's First description of schizophrenia by Emil Kraeplin 1917: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the insane, including 22 diagnoses. 1952: First DSM, 130 pages long, 106 disorders 1994: DSM-IV, 886 pages long, 297 disorders 2000: DSM-IV-TR, 943 pages long, 365 disorders 2013: DSM-5, 991 pages long, 157 disorders 2022: DSM-5-TR, 1050 pages long Standardizes billing and coding
Standardizes diagnoses and treatment
Guides research
Guides treatment Oversimplifies human behavior
Increases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis
Provides labels, which can be stigmatizing Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation
Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy Categorical: A categorical approach to assessment relied on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity.
Presence or absence
Yes or no Dimensional: Frequency: None of the time to all of the time
Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly Intensity/Severity: Absent 0, mild 1, moderate 2, severe 3 Duration: How long does it last? First (Categorical): Yes / no Second (Frequency): How often? Third (Intensity/Severity): Rating (Mild, moderate, severe) Fourth (Duration): How long does it last? Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders.
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation.
Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process.
Integrates measures administered at initial interview and over time to track symptom status and response to treatment. Disorder-specific and correspond closely to the diagnostic criteria.
Some are self-completed by the individual, couple, or family. Interpreted by the clinician
Shared back with the individual, couple, or family Others require a clinician to complete. A generic assessment instrument for health and disability.
Used across all diseases, including mental, neurological, and addictive disorders.
Short, simple and easy to administer (5 to 20 minutes)
Applicable in both clinical and general population settings.
A tool to produce standardized disability levels and profiles.
Applicable across cultures, in all adult populations.
Directly linked at the level of concepts to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) The reason for the assessment, including the member's: Perception of the condition
Description of symptoms (including reason for referral)
History of mental health treatment (including review of member's records)
Important developmental incidents
Maltreatment, trauma or abuse issues
History of alcohol and drug usage and treatment
Health history and family health history, including physical, chemical and mental health history
Cultural influences and their impact on the member An assessment of the member's needs based on: Baseline measurements
Symptoms
Behavior
Skills
Abilities
Resources
Vulnerabilities
Safety Assessment methods and use of standardized assessment tools
Clinical summary, including recommendations and prioritization of needed mental health or other services
Involvement of the member and member's family in the assessment and his or her preferences or referrals to services.
Sufficient data to support findings on all axes of the current Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM), and any differential diagnosis. We don't truly have systemic diagnoses in the US context
The medical model warrants an INDIVIDUAL (identified patient/client)
Diagnoses are listed by INDIVIDUAL
Diagnostic criteria for relational problems are needed. M The relationship comes first
Making a diagnosis is a team effort
Open-ended and check-list questions
Use screeners/questions to hone in on the diagnosis
Pay attention to clinical significance
Risk/benefit analysis of diagnosis
Understand comorbidity
Be cautious about 'other' categories
Document your thinking
Remember the stakes are high

Discernment counseling is a short-term process (one to five sessions) with the goal of greater clarity and confidence in the decision about a direction for the marriage, based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and each partner's contribution to the problems. It is not intended for cases in which one partner has made a final decision to divorce and simply wants a venue to convince their spouse to accept the decision. The immediate decision is whether to carve out a 6-month period of all-out effort in couples therapy to restore the marriage to health, with divorce off the table during that time. At the end of 6 months, they can reopen the decision about divorce on the basis of what they have learned about the prospect of successfully rebuilding their marriage. Therapy aims for improvement in the relationship (e.g., increased intimacy, decreased toxic conflict), whereas discernment counseling aims for clarity and confidence about a next step. The goal of discernment counseling is not to solve marriage problems but to see whether they can be solved.
There is no relationship homework for couples in discernment counseling, no teaching of skills during sessions, and no enactments of deeper ways to connect.
If clients ask for ways to manage their problems during discernment counseling, we use a 'restraint from change' approach by reminding them that relationship change should not be expected during discernment counseling. Path 1: The marraige as it has been: the status quo, neither divorce nor working in therapy to improve the relationship. Path 2: Separation or divorce Path 3: A 6-month commitment to couples therapy (and sometimes other forms of help, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, or individual therapy) with divorce off the table and with the possibility of putting divorce back on the table at the end of the 6 months. The idea behind path 3 is to move beyond amibalence about working on change and see whether it is possible to put the marriage into a place that would be good for both partners.
Path 3, as we emphasize repeatedly, involves each partner developing a personal agenda for change on the basis of a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and their role in the problems. An advantage of framing the immediate outcomes as paths is that it moves clients past the dichotomous choice between staying together or breaking-up. The therapist too can support the idea that something has to change - the marriage cannot continue as it has been. So sometimes the discernment process begins with agreements instead of disagreement - something has to change; the old ways of being married is no longer viable. Implicitly we are saying that divorce is not a failure in this process; it is simply one of the options to be explored in a serious way, even thought only one spouse is actively considering it. Sometimes it has taken years to build up the courage to put divorce on the table in a chronically distressed marriage. Path 3 avoids the 'in or out' conundrum by offering a provisional commitment to work hard on the relationship for a period, with divorce not an option for this period but something that can be revisited later if things do not change enough. Most of the work occurs in separate conversations with each spouse, with carefully orchestrated sharing of take-home messages from the individual conversations. The flow of the sessions goes this way: Time with the couple together
Meeting with one spouse alone (the other goes to the waiting room)
The other spouse returns and the first spouse summarizes key learning from the individual conversation Meeting with the second spouse alone
The second spouse shares learning from that conversation A check out with both spouses during which time the therapist shares reflections on the process thus far. The majority of the time is with each partner alone. Times when both parties are together in the room are carfully orchestrated to minimize demoralizing exchanges and to maximize the focus on what each is learning about themselves in the process, rather than what each wants the other to change. The individual conversations have both similar and different areas of focus for the leaning-in and leaning-out partners. Similar themes are helping each better understand the dynamics of the relationship (their relational dance), their individual contributions to the problems, and how these relational and personal issues could be addressed in couples therapy (and sometimes with other helping resources). In terms of different themes, the therapist helps the leaning-out spouse figure out which path to take on the basis of an exploration of the sources of the person‚Äôs pain and discouragement about the prospect of change. The focus is on making a decision that has integrity for one‚Äôs self and others on the basis of a deeper understanding of self and the marriage and how the problems could be addressed in couples therapy if that is the chosen direction. The limit of five sessions, although not immutable, creates an expectation of intense work within a limited time frame. Going on much longer also makes it difficult for the couple not to expect relationship change and for the therapist to not lapse into doing couple interventions.
We say one to five sessions and not five sessions because clients are asked each time about whether they want to do an additional session up to five. Some people are emotionally flat when their spouse is in the room and then liven up when our one-to-one time begins. A big part of this approach is helping clients see the difference between traditional marital therapy and discernment counseling and allowing them to indicate their willingness to engage in the process. We are interested in knowing exactly what the couple knows about discernment counseling. The clients must leave the conversation with an understanding that the goal for discernment counseling is to help them gain greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage. We pay specific attention to whether they are currently living together and the status of any legal proceedings associated with divorce. After collecting some basic information over the phone, we typically ask something such as, "Can you tell me a bit about your current situation and how do you think it might be helpful to your situation?" It is important that leaning-out partners feel heard and that they understand how this process is different from anything they have tried as a couple before. It is important to assess whether leaning-out partners have made a decision to divorce or are open to the work of discernment. The following questions can be helpful in determining this: "Would you say that you've made your decision about the future of your marriage or are you still seeking some level of clarity in this process?"
If they report that they have made a decision, you can ask about their level of confidence in the decision: "How confident are you that you're making the right decision?" For leaning-out partners who indicate they know they want a divorce and would like to use the session to 'break the news' to their partner, or for those who say they do not know how to tell their partner, you can inform them that this is not consistent with the goals of discernment counseling. You might respond in the following manner: "It may be that discernment counseling is not exactly a good fit for what you want to do. The goals of discernment counseling are to help people get a greater sense of clarity and confidence in their decision making about a direction for the future of their marriage based on a better understanding of what happened to the marriage to get it to the brink of divorce and each person's role in that. If you're hoping for a different outcome, like helping your spouse understand why you want a divorce, discernment counseling is not appropriate for your situation." Usually, the leaning-in partner makes it clear that they want to preserve the marriage, but if not, ask that question directly. If the leaning-in partner feels desperate to do anything to save their marriage, suggest that they purchase and begin reading Michele Weiner-Davis's (2002) book The Divorce Remedy. (They learn that they must first look at themselves and their own behavior before the marriage can get to a healthier place) "Her book is written specifically for people who have recently found out that their spouse is considering divorce. She gives some practical advice on how you can act toward your partner at this stage of the process. There are probably things you can be working on that will make the situation somewhat better without making your partner feel as though he or she is committing to working on the relationship. This approach may be your best option at the moment." We cannot emphasize enough the value of respecting client autonomy during this process. Never assume that both parties are equally interested in attending discernment counseling. Discernment counseling is a way of meeting both parties where they are and not privileging one person's agenda over the other. "It is really important that your spouse feel as though they have a choice in whether to come to discernment counseling. If he or she feels forced into it, it won't go well and will likely contribute to more estrangement from you on their part. " Never assume that because one spouse has told you about something that has been happening in the relationship, the other spouse knows about it. The intake conversation must be conducted one on one, without the person's partner or anyone else in the room. The person on the intake phone call has to be able to speak freely about their perspective on the problems they are having and the struggles they are experiencing making a decision regarding the future of their marriage. "Are you in a place that you can speak freely without interruptions?" If there is noise or other distractions, you may want to suggest a different time or place for the call. You also should ascertain whether the client has told their spouse about discernment counseling. "Have you discussed discernment counseling with your spouse? What do you think is his or her level of interest in participating? Does your spouse know that you and I are speaking today?" Avoid the temptation to speak to one partner right after the other for the sake of convenience. It is probably worth taking the time at the phone intake to ensure that no one is feeling forced into having this conversation. There is also benefit to suggesting that the first partner you speak with explain to their partner that they have spoken with a discernment counselor and that if the spouse is interested, they can e-mail or phone the counselor to set up an interview. In no case should you cold call the other partner, who may not be aware of the initial contact from the spouse. Consider using the following script as a guide to the initiator of the phone call: "It sounds like discernment counseling is appropriate for your situation according to what you've told me. The next step is for your partner and me to chat about their take on the situation and whether they are interested in discernment counseling. What might be a good idea for you is to tell your partner that we talked today, and point her to the website that describes discernment counseling. Further, you can tell them that if they are interested in doing this work, they can contact me directly and we can have a similar conversation to the one you and I just had. What is important here is that no one feels coerced to be part of this process. By putting the ball squarely in their court, they can demonstrate their willingness to do discernment counseling by initiating the call. " Respect the autonomy of each person to engage in this process at their own pace. The phone intake is to describe, in sufficient detail, the purpose, goals, and process of discernment counseling. "The goal of discernment is to help couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage based on a deeper understanding of the problems in the marriage and each person's contributions to them. "
"Discernment counseling is typically a brief counseling modality and could last anywhere between one and five sessions. There is no need to commit to all five sessions because each of you would only commit to attending one session at a time. "
"The format of the sessions consists of meeting as a couple with the counselor as well as having some time dedicated to one-on-one work with the counselor. After each one-on-one portion of the session, each partner will summarize what he or she is 'taking with them' from the time with the counselor and share it with the partner who was waiting outside the room. The first session is 2 hours, and subsequent sessions are an hour and a half each. "
"In discernment counseling, we discuss the paths that are before every couple on the brink of divorce. Path 1 we call the status quo path and represents your relationship continuing the way it current is. Path 2 represents the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the possible reconciliation path, in which the couple agrees to take divorce off the table for a 6-month period of couples therapy, and each one commits to work on the relationship to see whether they can get the relationship to a healthier place. These three paths frame the discussions we have in discernment counseling."
"Discernment counseling is different from typical marriage counseling. The goal is not to solve your problems but to help you decide whether to try to solve your problems or choose a different path. It's not about immediate change in your relationship but seeing what changes each of you might need to make in the future if you decide to work on yourselves and your marriage."
Finally, you can end this portion of the phone intake by asking how this process sounds to them and whether they are still interested on the basis of what you have discussed: "Does this sound like a process that might hold some value for you in your current situation?" We are mostly concerned with is whether one of the partners is feeling coerced to participate and whether participating in discernment counseling will put one of the partners at risk of IPV.
- "We want to make sure everyone who participates in discernment counseling does so voluntarily and that no one is put at risk. So I have a few questions that we ask everyone who contacts us for an appointment.
- Are you feeling pressured by your spouse to participate in this project? Yes / No.
- If yes, does the pressure seem coercive (for example, is it accompanied by threats with personal or legal ramifications)? Yes / No
- Have you or your spouse ever had an order of protection from a court? Yes / No
- If yes, who?
- My last questions are about what happens when you and your partner get into arguments or fights. Again, our goal is to make sure everyone is safe.
- Has your partner ever done something to you out of anger that has caused you physical pain, bruises, or bodily injury? Yes / No (If yes, get specifics)
- Do you ever feel afraid of your spouse? Yes / No
- If yes, are you in danger now? Yes / No
- If yes to either, I can help you talk to someone at an agency that can help you. Would you like me to give you that information? In an emergency, urge the person to call 911. Ask if you can call back to check on the person.
‚ÄúLeaning In or Out Measure.png‚Äù could not be found. We strongly recommend a 2-hour block of time because of the amount of ground to be covered in the session. After both partners' perspectives are heard in response to a series of questions, the discernment counselor meets one-on-one with both members of the couple, and each briefly shares what he or she learned in the individual conversations. The session ends with the couple in the room together for a summary of the work that was done that day and any impressions the discernment counselor has to share. If both spouses agree, the second discernment counseling session is then scheduled. In this first meeting together, each person is asked to share their own and listen to the other‚Äôs views on how the relationship got to the point where divorce is a possibility, how they have tried to fix the problems they have identified, and how their children (if any) play a role in their decision making. They are also asked to provide a brief account of a time when things were going well in the relationship.

- Precontemplation:
- A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior; the person may be unaware that a problem exists
- Contemplation:
- The person becomes aware that there is a problem, but has made no commitment to change.
- Preparation:
- The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change)
- Action:
- The person is in active modification of behavior.
- Maintenance:
- Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional.
- Relapse:
- The person falls back into old patterns of behavior.
- Upward Spiral:
- Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/the-cycle-of-change.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/The Cycle of Change.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telehealth]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/telehealth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Telehealth.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stereotype]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stereotype.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Stereotype.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stages of Therapist Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-href="@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@pattersonessentialskillsfamily2018.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018</a>
Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, ‚Äúself of the therapist‚Äù stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family. Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist‚Äôs ability to listen and attend to the client‚Äôs story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins. The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics. ‚ÄúI know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in the content.‚Äù Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
Therapists‚Äô unresolved issues or ‚Äúgrowth areas‚Äù can become impediments in therapy.
The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy. Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. Therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors. Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy. To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
You also need a strong social support network Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable Keep the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
Keep the following ‚Äòreminders‚Äô at hand:** Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stages-of-therapist-development.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Stages of Therapist Development.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Socioeconomic Status (SES)]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/socioeconomic-status-(ses).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Socioeconomic Status (SES).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Self-Concealment]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Responsible handing of secrets is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems. Secrets indirectly influence the couple system due to the consequences and symptoms of secrets.

Provides insight into why programs work or do not work. (pg. 1720)
There is a major caveat in previous effectiveness research with the absence of information on program integrity. It is often unknown to what extent programs are actually implemented as originally intended (i.e., program integrity). (pg. 1720) The absence of significant intervention effects can be explained either as a lack of effectiveness of the intervention itself, or as a failure to implement the intervention as originally intended. (pg. 1720) Based on the limited information on program integrity provided, there are differences with program implementation and integrity across studies. (pg. 1721)
Without documentation of program integrity it is impossible to determine whether significant, non-significant or ambiguous findings can be attributed to the theoretical model underly- ing the program, or to the implementation of the program.

A balanced therapeutic alliance is crucial for the success of couple therapy; the therapist does not accept the role of judge. If there is egregious or abusive behavior, the therapist takes a stand; violence is out of bounds and the principle of safety first is bedrock in any therapy. Nevertheless, even setting limits and identifying problematic behavior is done from a place of concern and compassion. The therapist maintains a stance of ‚Äúmultidirected partiality‚Äù partial to each partner, on each one‚Äôs side. When clients feel understood and affirmed, the therapist can challenge them. Multidirected partiality is not neutrality; the therapist cares about both partners, is partial to each. But the partiality is balanced. The couple therapy office must be a ‚Äúshame-free, blame-free zone,‚Äù a safe environment for clients to explore their vulnerabilities and relational disappointments. It is crucial that clinicians be aware of their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies, and note when they get caught up in a vulnerability cycle with clients. Therapists need to address unfinished business with their own family of origin.

A mental disorder syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.
Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (i.e., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.

EQUIP is implemented in all juvenile correctional facilities as part of a nationwide methodology. (pg. 1720)
EQUIP is designed to teach antisocial youth to think and act responsibly by combining a peer helping and skills-streaming approach.

Popular stereotypical conceptions of Martian men and Venetian women (e.g., Gray, 1993)
Suggest the differences between men and women stem from innate biological or psychological attributes. Previous studies have suggested men are less able to tolerate sustained levels of physiological arousal than women. This also suggest men and women grow up in differing social worlds. (Holley et al., (2010))
(Smith et al., (2010)) Stable differences between men and women explain why wife-demand/husband-withdraw (WDHW) occurs more than husband-demand/wife-withdraw (HDWW) (Eldridge &amp; Christensen, 2002). Some scholars have proposed that women are socialized to be more oriented towards relationships than are men (Napier, 1978)

This principle requires researchers to: Treat people fairly. Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research.

The accident was precipitated by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK-1000 reactor and operator errors. In particular, the RBMK reactor had an unstable design (a positive void coefficient), meaning a loss of coolant could accelerate the nuclear reaction, and its control rods had graphite tips that initially increased reactivity when inserted (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output could increase if cooling,other safety mechanisms have been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output%20could%20increase%20if%20cooling,other%20safety%20mechanisms%20have%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). During the test, operators disabled critical safety systems and drove the reactor to a low-power, unstable state. A sudden power surge ensued when they attempted an emergency shutdown, leading to massive energy buildup.<br>Moments later, a steam explosion blew apart the reactor core, followed by a second explosion (likely hydrogen or another steam blast) that demolished the reactor building and exposed the core to the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The blasts ignited fires, including a graphite fire in the reactor core, that burned for ten days. The underlying causes trace to poor safety culture and secrecy in the USSR at the time. An investigation later concluded that the accident was ‚Äúthe result of a flawed reactor design‚Ä¶ operated with inadequately trained personnel,‚Äù exacerbated by Cold War isolation and lack of safety culture (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The April 1986 disaster at,lack of any safety culture" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20April%201986%20disaster%20at,lack%20of%20any%20safety%20culture" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In short, inherent reactor vulnerabilities and human mistakes combined to trigger the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.<br>The immediate human toll of Chernobyl was severe.

In the days that followed, dozens of firefighters and first responders who heroically fought the fires received extremely high radiation doses. <a data-href="Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)</a> devastated many of them: 28 emergency workers died from ARS within a few weeks (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

Dozens more suffered serious radiation injuries.<br>Soviet authorities evacuated the surrounding population as the scale of the disaster became evident. The nearby company town of Pripyat (population ~49,000) was not informed of the danger on the first day. Only 36 hours after the accident, on April 27, buses finally moved all Pripyat residents out, turning it into a ghost city (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion zone was established 36,8" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion%20zone%20was%20established%2036,8" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).

The sudden displacement and fear caused significant trauma among the population.Offsite, there were no immediate deaths, but radiation sickness symptoms did appear in some of the local populace soon after (e.g. headaches, metallic taste). Tens of millions across Europe were exposed to low levels of fallout (see environmental impact below), and children in affected areas were given iodine tablets in some regions to block radioactive iodine uptake. The psychological shock and confusion were immense ‚Äì for Soviet citizens who were kept largely in the dark initially, and for neighboring countries alarmed by the drifting radiation.<br>The Chernobyl accident caused an unprecedented release of radioactive material into the environment. The initial explosion and subsequent fire ejected at least 5% of the reactor‚Äôs radioactive core into the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). A towering plume of radioactive gases and particles drifted with the winds for over a week. The most intense fallout blanketed areas close to the plant. A 4-6 km¬≤ pine forest immediately downwind was saturated with radiation; the trees literally died and turned rust-red within days, earning it the name the ‚ÄúRed Forest.‚Äù This 600-hectare patch of woodland absorbed lethal doses (up to ~100 Gray), killing the pines and many small animals in the area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl‚Äôs impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>).

Livestock had to be slaughtered and crops were ruined across large swathes of land. Water and soil near the site were severely contaminated; radiological ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù (with dangerous levels of cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, etc.) dotted the map in northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.<br>The radioactive plume did not stop at the Soviet borders. Within two days, winds carried radionuclides into Eastern and Northern Europe. On April 28, sensors at the Forsmark nuclear plant in Sweden (over 1,000 km away) detected radiation, forcing an investigation that revealed the source was Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant%2C,rising radiation levels%2C but a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the%20Forsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%2C,rising%20radiation%20levels%2C%20but%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). As the cloud spread, rain-outs deposited contamination in patches across Europe. Notably, parts of Belarus (to the north) received heavy fallout, as did areas of Scandinavia, Poland, Austria, and the UK. In the United Kingdom, for example, radioactive cesium from Chernobyl fell on upland pastures; in the immediate aftermath, the government restricted the movement of some 4.2 million sheep across 9,700 farms to prevent tainted meat entering the food supply (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).

Across Europe, a wide range of foods (milk, leafy vegetables, wild game, mushrooms, etc.) had to be tested or discarded in 1986 due to fallout contamination.<br>In the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, the environment was badly scarred. The reactor fire belched radioactive iodine-131, cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium and other isotopes into the air (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). Iodine-131 (with an 8-day half-life) delivered high doses to the thyroids of grazing animals and children who drank local milk in the first weeks, causing later thyroid disorders. Heavier elements fell close to the plant, creating an extremely hazardous zone within ~10 km. The Pripyat River and Dnieper water basin were threatened by runoff; emergency crews dug up topsoil and built dams to prevent contaminants from spreading through waterways. Despite these efforts, ecological damage was acute: plants died, and some animal populations in high-dose areas crashed or stopped reproducing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The immediate environmental legacy of Chernobyl was a poisoned landscape ‚Äì an estimated 77 kilograms of radioactive material were lofted into the atmosphere, traveling as far as 2,000 km away (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>), and leaving a footprint of contamination that would last for generations.<br>The Chernobyl disaster had significant immediate political repercussions, both domestically within the Soviet Union and internationally. In the USSR, the accident exposed the deep flaws in the Soviet government‚Äôs crisis management and secrecy. Initially, authorities were slow to admit the severity of the situation. Local evacuations were delayed and the broader public was not informed promptly. Only on April 28 ‚Äì two days after the explosion, once Swedish monitors raised global alarm ‚Äì did the Soviet government make a brief 20-second announcement on state TV acknowledging an accident at Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An investigative commission has been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An%20investigative%20commission%20has%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). This minimalist statement offered few details, reflecting the regime‚Äôs instinct to cover up bad news. Such lack of transparency put citizens at risk and angered neighboring countries. Gorbachev himself did not publicly address Chernobyl until May 14, 1986, more than three weeks later. The delay and initial secrecy eroded public trust. Soviet citizens in Ukraine and Belarus, seeing helicopters overhead and troops moving without clear explanation, felt a sense of betrayal that they were not immediately warned of the invisible danger.<br>Internationally, Chernobyl proved to be a public relations disaster for the Soviet Union. The USSR was criticized for its failure to promptly alert the world and for rejecting outside help initially. The incident strained relations with Western Europe ‚Äì for example, Sweden, Finland, and others demanded explanations as radioactive clouds crossed their territories. The political fallout added pressure on Soviet leadership to be more open and cooperative. The disaster became a catalyst for Glasnost (openness): it demonstrated the deadly cost of government secrecy. Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that ‚Äúthe nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl‚Ä¶ even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union‚Äù five years later (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls The nuclear meltdown at,The commission was to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls%20The%20nuclear%20meltdown%20at,The%20commission%20was%20to" target="_self">VIEW: Turning point at Chernobyl ‚Äî Mikhail S Gorbachev</a>). While historians debate the extent of Chernobyl‚Äôs role in the USSR‚Äôs dissolution, it undeniably undermined the credibility of Soviet authorities. The tragedy spurred newfound environmental activism and public questioning of nuclear safety in the Eastern Bloc. In summary, the immediate political consequence was a profound shock that forced the Soviet government to confront its own shortcomings, setting in motion changes that transcended the issue of nuclear power.<br>In the decades since 1986, extensive studies have been conducted on Chernobyl‚Äôs health impact. The most clear-cut long-term health effect has been a sharp increase in thyroid cancer cases among those who were children or adolescents in affected areas at the time of the accident. Radioactive iodine-131 released from the reactor accumulated in pastures and was ingested via milk; this led to an epidemic of thyroid disorders. By 2005, over 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported in exposed children/teens (notably in Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Fortunately, thyroid cancer is largely treatable ‚Äì the vast majority of patients survived. As of 2011, 15 deaths had been attributed to these Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Aggressive screening and treatment campaigns in the 1990s saved many lives. Aside from thyroid issues, major epidemiological surveys have not conclusively linked the Chernobyl accident to a generalized increase in other cancers or health effects in the broader population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), ‚Äúapart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident.‚Äù (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In particular, studies have not found a definitive rise in leukemia, solid tumors, or birth defects that can be attributed to Chernobyl radiation exposure in the general population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>However, it is important to note that estimating long-term deaths is complex and subject to debate. Low-dose radiation effects are hard to tease out from normal cancer rates. Some scientific models project that over the lifetime of those exposed, Chernobyl‚Äôs fallout could cause a few thousand excess cancer deaths (for example, one projection suggested about 4,000 future cancer deaths among the higher-exposed groups in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are expected from other causes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are%20expected%20from%20other%20causes" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Other analyses, often using the linear no-threshold model, predict higher numbers ‚Äì for instance, a 2006 report (TORCH) estimated 30,000 to 60,000 worldwide cancer deaths in the long run due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Anti-nuclear organizations have cited figures in the tens of thousands as well (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). These larger estimates are controversial and not universally accepted; they rely on statistical assumptions and include very low-dose regions where any effect would be too small to measure. The consensus of bodies like the WHO and UNSCEAR is that outside of thyroid cancers, Chernobyl‚Äôs long-term health impacts (while tragic on an individual level) have been limited in scope relative to initial fears (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Nonetheless, each of those statistics reflects personal tragedies and serious illnesses that have affected thousands of families.<br>Beyond physical health, the psychological and social effects have been profound. The disaster uprooted entire communities and created an enduring sense of fear. Studies have found elevated rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse among Chernobyl evacuees and residents of contaminated areas ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015%29" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). The term ‚Äúradiophobia‚Äù has been used to describe the chronic fear of radiation exposure that many people carry, sometimes causing more harm (in stress and mental health) than the radiation itself. Being labeled a ‚ÄúChernobyl victim‚Äù or ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù led to social stigma and hopelessness in some cases (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Populations in affected areas often reported worse self-assessed health than objective medical exams would indicate, due to perceived danger (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Thus, a major long-term impact of Chernobyl has been on mental health and community cohesion. The disaster also had inter-generational aspects: while studies (including a 2021 whole-genome study) have not found evidence of significant genetic mutations passed to children of survivors or liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1929 Chernobyl liquidators,generational genetic effects.[ 223" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1929%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,generational%20genetic%20effects.%5B%20223" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>), young people from the region have grown up under the shadow of Chernobyl‚Äôs legacy, which influences their social and economic opportunities.<br>In summary, nearly 39 years on, Chernobyl‚Äôs health legacy is a mixed picture. There have been thousands of thyroid cancers (largely survivable), and possibly some increase in other cancers and health issues among the most exposed, but no mass epidemic of radiation-induced disease outside those categories that can be unambiguously demonstrated (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The trauma and displacement caused by the disaster, however, left lasting scars on public health in the form of psychological distress and disrupted lives.Paradoxically, the long-term ecological effects of Chernobyl include both persistent environmental contamination and the revival of wildlife in the abandoned zone. In the immediate aftermath, Chernobyl created one of the most radioactive environments on the planet, devastating local ecosystems. Yet over time, as humans withdrew from the area, nature has shown a remarkable capacity to rebound in many respects.<br>On the negative side, the environment remains contaminated with long-lived radionuclides that will persist for decades or more. Isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life ~30 years) and strontium-90 (half-life ~29 years) still taint the soil and vegetation in the Exclusion Zone and beyond. In the worst hot spots (e.g. the Red Forest and near the reactor), soil and plant life are loaded with radionuclide levels that inhibit normal biological processes. Studies have found increased mutation rates in many organisms: one analysis showed plant and animal mutation rates in the Chernobyl region were up to 20 times higher than normal background levels (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150‚Äì200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). There is evidence of elevated mortality and reduced reproductive success in some species living in the most contaminated areas, consistent with radiation-induced genetic damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150‚Äì200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). For example, some birds in high-radiation zones have been observed to have smaller brain sizes or cataracts, and fewer insects (like bees, butterflies, spiders) are found in these areas in some studies. Trees in certain plots grow more slowly due to radionuclide uptake. Forest ecosystems have been altered: the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) in soil were initially impaired by radiation, leading to a thick layer of semi-decomposed leaf litter that persisted for years. Even today, wild boar in parts of Germany and Austria still show high cesium levels from eating Chernobyl-tainted mushrooms and soils (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported,lamb industry in Norway were" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Agricultural%20Authority%20reported,lamb%20industry%20in%20Norway%20were" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). And periodic wildfires in the Exclusion Zone can remobilize radionuclides, as burning plants release cesium and strontium back into the air ‚Äì a concern that persists each fire season. Thus, ecologically, Chernobyl created a chronic environmental hazard in the contaminated regions: a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù ecosystem where radioactive elements circulate and will slowly decay over generations.<br>On the other hand, the absence of human activity in the vast Exclusion Zone has allowed wildlife to flourish in unexpected ways. With 2,600 km¬≤ of land (in Ukraine) largely free from people, the area has become an unintended wildlife sanctuary. By the 2010s, biologists conducting long-term censuses observed that many large animal populations were thriving. A 2015 scientific study using animal track counts and camera traps found no evidence of reduced mammal abundance in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone compared to similar uncontaminated nature reserves ‚Äì in fact, populations of elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves were as high or higher than in less disturbed reserves (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The study concluded that chronic radiation had not significantly affected these wildlife populations; instead, the removal of humans (and associated activities like farming, hunting, logging) allowed nature to rebound vigorously (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Subsequent research and observations have noted an increase in biodiversity: the Exclusion Zone now hosts species rarely seen in the region for decades prior. Wolves roam in large numbers (some estimates suggest the zone has one of the highest densities of wolves in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Lynx and Eurasian brown bears ‚Äì species that were once extirpated locally ‚Äì have been spotted within the zone. Endangered European bison have been reintroduced and are breeding. The Przewalski‚Äôs horse, a rare wild equine, was released into the zone in the 1990s and now herds of these horses graze the grasslands of Chernobyl. Moose, foxes, badgers, wild boar, deer, and dozens of bird species inhabit the forests and marshes. Even the Pripyat town itself and derelict buildings are used by wildlife (e.g. nesting birds, small mammals). In essence, in the long term, Chernobyl‚Äôs ecosystem has transformed into a unique experiment: a landscape of high radiation pockets but flourishing wildlife, illustrating the resilience of nature when freed from human pressures (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some scientists have termed it a ‚Äúaccidental wildlife reserve.‚Äù Photographic evidence and surveys by organizations like the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve (established by Ukraine in 2016) document robust ecosystems, though still affected by the residue of contamination.<br>It‚Äôs important to balance this picture: radiation is certainly not ‚Äúgood‚Äù for wildlife, and in highly contaminated spots the damage to organisms is real (for instance, smaller creatures with short lifespans show higher mutation impacts). Scientists continue to debate the extent of sublethal effects on Chernobyl‚Äôs wildlife ‚Äì some studies find more genetic abnormalities or shorter lifespans in animals from radioactive hot spots, while others point to the abundant population numbers as a sign of adaptation or tolerance (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl‚Äôs impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). The likely reality is that many species have been able to recover because the benefit of habitat free from humans outweighs the detriments of the radiation levels they experience (which for most of the zone are low to moderate now). The Chernobyl zone has thus become a living laboratory for studying chronic low-dose radiation on ecosystems, with ongoing research that will inform ecology and radiobiology for decades. From an ecological perspective, Chernobyl‚Äôs legacy is a landscape of contrasts: lingering contamination and altered biological processes, alongside a teeming revival of wildlife in what has become one of Europe‚Äôs largest rewilded areas.<br>The Chernobyl disaster‚Äôs ramifications extended into the geopolitical and policy realm, influencing nuclear energy policies and international cooperation. In the Soviet Union, as mentioned, Chernobyl was a catalyst for Glasnost and political reform. It forced Soviet leadership to cooperate more with international authorities ‚Äì for example, in August 1986 (just months after the accident), the USSR sent a delegation to the IAEA in Vienna to openly present details of the accident to the world, a notable break from past secrecy ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were subsequently restarted but all,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were%20subsequently%20restarted%20but%20all,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Gorbachev‚Äôs policies of openness were reinforced by the recognition that hiding disasters was untenable. In the bigger picture, Chernobyl ‚Äúled to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union.‚Äù (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The Chernobyl disaster was a,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20Chernobyl%20disaster%20was%20a,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some commentators even argue that the disaster contributed to the fall of the USSR by exposing its systemic problems and costing enormous resources ‚Äì as noted earlier, Gorbachev later said Chernobyl was a more important factor in the Soviet collapse than his own reform efforts (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C particularly between East and,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C%20particularly%20between%20East%20and,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>On the international stage, nuclear safety was fundamentally re-examined. Chernobyl was the first nuclear accident to directly result in radiation fatalities (and remains one of only two Level 7 accidents, along with Fukushima 2011). This spurred a wave of new protocols and cooperation. Western and Soviet-bloc experts began collaborating to prevent another Chernobyl. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was established, linking operators from over 30 countries to share safety information and peer reviews (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since 1989%2C over 1000 nuclear,in the Nuclear Power Industry" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since%201989%2C%20over%201000%20nuclear,in%20the%20Nuclear%20Power%20Industry" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The IAEA implemented the Convention on Nuclear Safety (adopted in 1994), a treaty that committed nations to international nuclear plant inspections and higher safety standards (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Design changes were rapidly instituted for RBMK reactors ‚Äì all remaining RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania, etc.) were retrofitted with safety upgrades: e.g. adding neutron absorbers, faster shut-down systems, and eliminating the positive void coefficient at low power (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications have been made to,see Post accident changes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications%20have%20been%20made%20to,see%20Post%20accident%20changes" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) so that a Chernobyl-type runaway reaction ‚Äúis now virtually impossible‚Äù in those reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). International aid (through organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped finance these safety improvements and the eventual decommissioning of Chernobyl‚Äôs other reactors.<br>Public opinion toward nuclear energy also shifted significantly after Chernobyl, especially in Europe. The accident fueled anti-nuclear movements and policy reversals in several countries. For example, in Italy, Chernobyl triggered a national referendum in November 1987 in which over 80% of voters chose to abandon nuclear power; as a result, Italy shut down its existing reactors and scrapped plans for new ones (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C only the widespread popular,a question of individual conscience" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C%20only%20the%20widespread%20popular,a%20question%20of%20individual%20conscience" target="_self">Nuclear Power, No Thanks! The Aftermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the Nuclear Power Referendum of 1987 | Environment &amp; Society Portal</a>). In West Germany, large anti-nuclear protests took place, and although Germany did not immediately phase out nuclear (that came later), Chernobyl planted seeds of skepticism that eventually contributed to Germany‚Äôs decision to end nuclear power by 2022. Other countries like Austria (which had completed a nuclear plant but never fueled it, due to a referendum) felt vindicated. Even far from Europe, Chernobyl had an impact: nations such as the United States and UK reviewed their emergency preparedness; some countries paused or scaled back nuclear projects. The accident underscored that a nuclear disaster is not confined by borders, leading to improved international radiation monitoring networks and emergency response coordination (for instance, the EU created rapid notification systems for nuclear incidents).<br>Geopolitically, Chernobyl also imposed huge economic costs on the USSR (and later Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) ‚Äì estimated hundreds of billions of dollars over time ‚Äì contributing to economic stress. Belarus in particular, which received around 70% of the fallout, spent up to 25% of its national budget on Chernobyl consequences in the late 80s and 90s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In the aftermath of the,Ecology of the Chernobyl Catastrophe" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20the,Ecology%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Catastrophe" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More than 1,borne particles drifted to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More%20than%201,borne%20particles%20drifted%20to" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). This influenced those republics‚Äô politics and relations; for example, arguments over how to pay for Chernobyl recovery were part of the rising tensions in the dissolving Soviet Union. In Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, Chernobyl left a legacy that shaped its environmental and energy policy ‚Äì the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl (Unit 3) was only shut down in December 2000 as part of an agreement with Western countries that provided financial aid for safer energy projects ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).In summary, the long-term political and geopolitical impact of Chernobyl was far-reaching. It accelerated the end of the Soviet era, prompted a global reckoning on nuclear safety, fostered East-West scientific cooperation, and strengthened international regulatory frameworks. It also invigorated citizen movements and influenced national policies on energy. The world‚Äôs nuclear industry after 1986 underwent significant reforms in training, reactor design, risk communication, and emergency planning, all under the shadow of lessons learned from Chernobyl.<br>Right after the explosions, an urgent priority was to extinguish the fires and contain the damage at the power plant. In the early hours of April 26, plant workers and local firefighters rushed to the scene with no full knowledge of the radiation hazard. A fire raged on the roof of Unit 3 (adjacent to the destroyed Unit 4) as well as throughout the wreckage of Unit 4. Fire brigades worked feverishly to douse the flames and keep them from spreading to other reactor buildings. By 5:00 AM, most of the external fires (on the roof and around the building) were extinguished, thanks to these responders ‚Äì many of whom absorbed massive radiation doses in the process (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). However, inside Reactor 4, the graphite core fire was burning like a giant ember, uncontrollably spewing radiation. It continued to burn for ten days, not fully going out until May 6, 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) when there was no more material left to burn.<br>To combat the reactor fire, the Soviet authorities initiated unprecedented measures. Within 24 hours, the military organized helicopter drops to smother the exposed core. Pilots flew directly over the glowing reactor, dumping load after load of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron into the inferno. In total, more than 5,000 tonnes of these materials were dropped from the air in the weeks after the accident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). It was an incredibly dangerous mission ‚Äì roughly 600 Soviet helicopter pilots and crew participated, many receiving high radiation doses as they hovered above the destroyed reactor (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The intent was to choke the fire and absorb neutrons to prevent any renewed nuclear chain reaction. (Later analysis suggests much of the dropped material did not stay in the core but the effort likely helped cool and bury the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).) Firefighters also pumped water into the reactor ruins until fears of a steam explosion in the basement halted that approach. Additionally, teams of engineers drained and vented the plant‚Äôs steam suppression pools under the reactor (the ‚Äúbubbler‚Äù pools) to remove water and prevent a potential secondary steam explosion that could have ejected even more radioactivity. This harrowing drain operation required three men to enter radioactive flooded corridors ‚Äì an oft-cited act of bravery (they survived due to quick work and later medical care).<br>Once the immediate crisis of fire and potential further explosions was under control, the focus shifted to cleaning up the massive radioactive mess ‚Äì a task that would take years. The Soviet Union marshaled an enormous workforce for this, later known as the ‚Äúliquidators.‚Äù These were civil and military personnel conscripted to liquidate (eliminate) the consequences of the accident. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 600,000 people from all over the USSR were officially recognized as Chernobyl liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). They included firefighters, soldiers, engineers, technicians, miners, medical staff, and even volunteers. In 1986‚Äì87 alone, about 240,000 recovery workers were on site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). Many were young conscripts in the Soviet Army sent to do manual decontamination work.<br>The liquidators‚Äô tasks were varied and often perilous. In the immediate aftermath, one critical job was to clear the highly radioactive debris from the roof of Unit 3 and the surroundings of Unit 4. Chunks of graphite core and reactor fuel had been hurled onto the rooftops and ground. Radiation on the roof was so intense (up to 10,000 R/hour in some spots) that even 1-2 minutes of exposure could deliver a dangerous dose (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Remote-controlled robots were attempted to shovel debris, but most failed quickly due to the radiation frying their electronics. Thus, human soldiers ‚Äì dubbed ‚Äúbio-robots‚Äù ‚Äì had to do it. Working in shifts of only about 40 to 90 seconds each, men sprinted onto the roof, shoveled a few scoops of debris over the edge, and ran back, never to return to that spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1173 Chernobyl liquidators,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1173%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl liquidators from the military%2C,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl%20liquidators%20from%20the%20military%2C,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Each did only one or two trips. By this method, the rooftops were cleared enough to allow construction of the shelter later.<br>Other liquidator crews decontaminated the ground: they used bulldozers and hand tools to scrape up topsoil, which was radioactive, and buried it in trenches. They washed down buildings, roads, and even livestock to remove fallout. A special substance called ‚ÄúBarda‚Äù (a sticky resin) was sprayed over large areas by trucks and helicopters to trap radioactive dust and prevent it from re-aerosolizing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters regularly sprayed large areas,2018%2C parked in a field" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters%20regularly%20sprayed%20large%20areas,2018%2C%20parked%20in%20a%20field" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). In Pripyat and other evacuated towns, teams went house to house to collect and dispose of irradiated belongings and to euthanize abandoned pets and livestock (to prevent them from spreading contamination). Miners were brought in to tunnel underneath the reactor; they excavated a cavity and poured concrete to create a cooling slab under the smoldering core (‚Äúcorium‚Äù) lava, to prevent it from melting through to groundwater ‚Äì this prevented a potential groundwater contamination catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of trees were cut down. Contaminated vehicles, helicopters, and equipment were taken out of service ‚Äì many were buried or dumped in a vehicle graveyard in the Zone (some remain there to this day, rusting and still radioactive (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The official contaminated zones saw,up effort lasting seven" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20official%20contaminated%20zones%20saw,up%20effort%20lasting%20seven" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>)).<br>The liquidators often worked under harsh, hasty conditions with inconsistent protection. Early on, many were not fully informed of the risks. They wore simple cotton jumpsuits or ill-fitting lead aprons and rudimentary respirators, if anything. As time went on, safety measures improved somewhat, but thousands of liquidators exceeded recommended radiation doses (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1258 ,99" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1258%20,99" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The average dose for the ~600k liquidators is estimated at about 120 mSv (12 rem) per person (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>), which is significant (roughly 50 times a typical yearly background dose). Some individuals, particularly those in 1986 roof and core cleanup, received much higher doses (several Sieverts in a few cases). Many liquidators later suffered health issues, and they are honored today for their sacrifice. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus commemorate Liquidators‚Äô Day (often on December 14, the date in 1986 when the reactor was declared sealed) to remember their contributions. These efforts by the liquidators were crucial in reducing the ongoing risk from Chernobyl ‚Äì they mitigated what could have been a far worse environmental outcome by working to contain and confine the radioactive materials.<br>A monumental engineering task in 1986 was to entomb the destroyed Reactor 4 to stop further radiation release. Immediately after the accident, Reactor No.4 was an open wound spewing radioactivity, so the Soviet government undertook the construction of a massive containment structure known colloquially as the ‚Äúsarcophagus.‚Äù Design work began just weeks after the accident, and construction started in June 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Despite the extreme conditions, within 206 days ‚Äì by late November 1986 ‚Äì the sarcophagus was completed and put in place over Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June 1986 Completed November 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June%201986%20Completed%20November%201986" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The design of the sarcophagus,The seams of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The%20design%20of%20the%20sarcophagus,The%20seams%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). (Some sources cite completion in November, others in early December, but essentially seven months after the disaster.)<br>The sarcophagus was essentially a hastily built steel and concrete shield, erected around the ruins to contain the radiation. It was enormous ‚Äì over 50 meters tall ‚Äì and had to be assembled largely by machines and remote welders because radiation levels near the core were deadly. Engineers improvised, often working by remote control or from cranes, to bolt together steel panels and pour concrete over the reactor building‚Äôs remains. By its completion, the ‚ÄúObject Ukrytie‚Äù (Object Shelter, the official name) encased about 200 tons of radioactive corium (lava-like melted core fuel), plus an estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and debris inside the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building of the Chernobyl Nuclear,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Nuclear,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive contamination of the,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive%20contamination%20%20of%20the,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). This ad-hoc containment prevented these materials from directly escaping to the environment. The sarcophagus also incorporated ventilation to prevent heat and gas buildup, and it sealed off the reactor from rain, which would otherwise leach radioactivity into the ground.<br>Structurally, the sarcophagus was supported in part by the ruined walls of Reactor 4 and was not hermetically tight, but it dramatically reduced radiation emissions from the site. By late 1986, radiation levels around the plant had dropped significantly due to the containment and natural decay of short-lived isotopes. This allowed the other reactors at Chernobyl (Units 1, 2, and 3), which had been shut down after the accident, to be restarted over the next year with added safety upgrades. (They continued operating for years under observation; Reactor 2 was closed in 1991 after a turbine hall fire, Reactor 1 in 1996, and Reactor 3 ‚Äì the last ‚Äì in 2000 ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).)<br>The sarcophagus, while a feat given the circumstances, was understood to be a temporary solution with an expected lifespan of perhaps 20‚Äì30 years. By the late 1990s, it had deteriorated ‚Äì the immense radiation and weathering caused cracks and weakened joints. Authorities installed jacks and braces in 1998 to prevent a collapse of the sarcophagus, as it was by then unstable (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Still, it remained an essential barrier keeping the radioactive inventory of Reactor 4 confined. The success of the initial sarcophagus was that it limited the contamination largely within the 30 km Zone and allowed recovery work to continue around the site with manageable radiation levels.<br>Recognizing the sarcophagus was aging, an international plan was developed to provide a more robust, long-term containment. This led to the New Safe Confinement (NSC) ‚Äì an enormous arch-shaped structure built to enclose the old sarcophagus and reactor building entirely. The NSC was a project funded by a consortium of nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (managed by the EBRD), with design/construction by Novarka (a French-led team). Construction began in 2012. Unlike the original sarcophagus, which was built in place, the NSC was assembled on a clean pad a short distance away and later slid over Reactor 4. By 2016, the colossal assembly was complete, and in November 2016 the entire 36,000-tonne arch was pushed 327 meters on rails to cover the reactor and old sarcophagus (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and preparatory work onsite was,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and%20preparatory%20work%20onsite%20was,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling equipment were fitted in,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling%20equipment%20were%20fitted%20in,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The NSC is designed to last at least 100 years, with a robust steel frame covered by stainless cladding. It is airtight and equipped with cranes and robotic equipment on the inside. The primary purpose of the NSC is not only to keep radioactive dust from escaping, but also to enable the future dismantling of the dangerously unstable old sarcophagus and the removal of the remaining nuclear fuel and debris inside Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The hermetically sealed building will,using as few personnel as" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20hermetically%20sealed%20building%20will,using%20as%20few%20personnel%20as" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

This will be an extremely challenging task, scheduled to take decades ‚Äì essentially the final phase of cleaning up Chernobyl.<br>With the NSC in place, the site is far more secure. The new structure prevents water intrusion, controls the environment around the reactor (humidity, etc.), and has filter systems to ensure no radioactive particles leak out during future dismantling work. As of today, the NSC has successfully isolated Reactor 4: radiation levels around the plant have declined further, and the risk of the old sarcophagus collapsing (which could have released dust) is mitigated. In February 2022, during the Russian invasion (discussed later), the NSC‚Äôs integrity was maintained despite military occupation of the area. A very recent incident on 14 February 2025 saw a drone strike hit the NSC‚Äôs roof, breaching its outer and inner steel panels, but radiation levels remained stable and no radioactive release occurred (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This event underscored the NSC‚Äôs importance and resilience.<br>In addition to the NSC, other cleanup infrastructure has been built: for example, a new Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISF-2) was constructed to safely store used nuclear fuel from the remaining Chernobyl reactors, completed in 2020 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent nuclear fuel storage facility,and cold tests took place" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent%20nuclear%20fuel%20storage%20facility,and%20cold%20tests%20took%20place" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Waste processing plants and monitoring systems have been established to manage the tons of radioactive waste generated by decommissioning and cleanup. The overall containment strategy is now long-term stewardship: maintain the new shelter, gradually dismantle the old one, remove and dispose of radioactive materials in a safe manner, and ensure the surrounding environment is protected.Through these massive efforts ‚Äì from the bravery of the 1986 liquidators to the high-tech engineering of the NSC ‚Äì the Chernobyl site has been transformed from an open reactor wreck to a contained and monitored facility. While full remediation (removal of all radioactive material) will take many more decades if not centuries, the risk of another release has been vastly reduced. Chernobyl has gone from an active crisis to a case of long-term containment, serving as a stark lesson and model in nuclear disaster management.Nearly four decades on, Chernobyl today is a very different place than it was in 1986. The reactor is silent and enclosed, nature has reclaimed much of the evacuated zone, and what was once a symbol of nuclear catastrophe has also become a site of scientific study, remembrance, and even tourism. This section covers the current conditions, including radiation levels, the status of the Exclusion Zone, ecological developments, and human activities like tourism and restoration projects, incorporating the latest available updates.<br>Ambient radiation levels in the Chernobyl region have dropped significantly since 1986, due to radioactive decay and cleanup efforts. Immediately after the accident, radiation in close proximity to the reactor could be fatal within minutes. Today, aside from a few hot spots, most of the Exclusion Zone has radiation levels that are within safe limits for short-term visits. For perspective, normal natural background radiation is about 2 mSv (millisieverts) per year (which is ~0.0002 mSv/hour). In much of the Exclusion Zone, current dose rates are only a few times above background or even equal to background in some areas (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl‚Äôs impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). For example, walking around in Pripyat town for an hour might give a dose on the order of a few microsieverts ‚Äì negligible in health terms. The ghost city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl plant‚Äôs perimeter, and main roads have been sufficiently decontaminated or decayed that short visits are not dangerous with basic precautions. The New Safe Confinement ensures that Reactor 4‚Äôs remains emit virtually no radiation into the outside environment; all major radioactive materials are contained within sturdy structures.<br>However, radioactive ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù remain in certain parts of the Exclusion Zone, and these are unsafe for extended exposure or habitation. The most notorious is the Red Forest just west of Reactor 4. Radiation there is still extremely high ‚Äì on the order of 0.4 mSv per hour (400 ¬µSv/h) in some patches, which is ‚Äúthousands of times higher than background levels and dangerous to live in‚Äù (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl‚Äôs impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). A person standing in the Red Forest for an hour could receive as much radiation as they normally would in several months. Needless to say, nobody is allowed to linger there, and it‚Äôs off-limits to tourists (even driving through the area, guides take care to roll up windows and not stop). Other localized hot spots include some parts of the reactor complex‚Äôs vicinity, areas where radioactive metal equipment lies in the open, or where fallout concentrated in 1986. These spots are well-mapped by authorities; warning signs mark areas of higher radiation.<br>Importantly, the radiation today is not uniform ‚Äì it‚Äôs very heterogeneous. While one spot might be 0.4 mSv/h, a few hundred meters away it might drop to 0.004 mSv/h. Overall, chronic radiation levels have ‚Äúplummeted‚Äù compared to the initial aftermath, and wildlife and even occasional workers can exist in the zone with only low-level exposure outside the hotspots (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether chronic radiation has any,chronically exposed to low levels" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether%20chronic%20radiation%20has%20any,chronically%20exposed%20to%20low%20levels" target="_self">Chernobyl‚Äôs impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl‚Äôs impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Long-lived isotopes like cesium-137 have undergone over one half-life since 1986, meaning roughly half of the initial amount has decayed away. Shorter-lived isotopes (iodine-131, xenon-133, etc.) disappeared long ago. The areas that remain dangerous are primarily those with concentrated transuranic elements (like parts of the reactor debris with plutonium) or where cesium and strontium were deposited most densely (e.g. forest floor litter).<br>As of today, experts consider the Exclusion Zone safe for controlled access ‚Äì scientists, workers, and tourists routinely enter for limited periods. The key is limiting time in higher-dose areas and not ingesting any contaminated materials (no eating berries or mushrooms from the zone, for example, as they concentrate radionuclides). The Ukrainian authorities have an extensive radiation monitoring network on-site. According to reports, even after incidents like forest fires or military occupation (more on that below), radiation levels remained ‚Äúwithin normal limits‚Äù for the zone and did not pose a danger outside the immediate area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>A recent real-world ‚Äústress test‚Äù of Chernobyl‚Äôs stability occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl site and occupied the Exclusion Zone for about five weeks. During that time, there were concerns about disturbances to radioactive soil. Indeed, Ukrainian officials reported a spike in gamma radiation readings, likely because Russian military vehicles churned up contaminated dust in the Red Forest with their movements (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) assessed that the rise was localized and levels ‚Äúremained low and near background levels‚Äù in areas where personnel were present (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).

(There were unconfirmed reports of some Russian soldiers later suffering radiation sickness.) Thankfully, despite the tense situation, no major structural damage occurred at Chernobyl‚Äôs containment facilities during the occupation. The plant‚Äôs power was cut for a time (raising concern about cooling of spent fuel storage), but backup systems and eventual reconnection prevented any incident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L174 The Chernobyl,on safety as a result" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20The%20Chernobyl,on%20safety%20as%20a%20result" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L195 The SNRIU,first time since 23 February" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L195%20The%20SNRIU,first%20time%20since%2023%20February" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). In late March 2022, Russian troops withdrew, and Ukrainian authorities regained control of the site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022 the Zaporizhzhia&nbsp;plant in southeastern" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022%20the%20Zaporizhzhia%C2%A0plant%20in%20southeastern" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). The episode highlighted that Chernobyl, while largely safe and stable, is still a sensitive site that needs protection. It also demonstrated the resilience of the New Safe Confinement and other systems ‚Äì they withstood the human disruptions without releasing radiation.<br>Another very recent event was the February 2025 drone strike mentioned earlier. A drone (attributed to Russian forces amid the ongoing conflict) detonated on the roof of the NSC. It managed to puncture the outer and inner steel layers of the NSC‚Äôs roof in one spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This was a serious incident, but the redundancy of the NSC‚Äôs design meant that even with those holes, no radioactive dust escaped. The IAEA confirmed that radiation levels inside and outside the structure stayed normal (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). Repairs are presumably planned to maintain full integrity. This event underscores that while the radiological condition of Chernobyl is under control, human factors and security remain relevant to its safety.In summary, Chernobyl is not a ticking time bomb now, but a contained contaminated site. Current radiation levels in most areas pose minimal risk for brief exposures, and the worst areas are well-restricted. There is no fission or reaction occurring ‚Äì the reactor fuel is inert and cooling for decades. The main ongoing safety focus is monitoring and managing the remaining radioactive materials to prevent any environmental release (especially during future fuel removal operations). With the new shelter and strong institutional oversight (even during conflict, international eyes like the IAEA are watching Chernobyl), the site‚Äôs condition is stable. It is safe enough for scientists, workers, and even tourists, provided regulations are followed, but it remains unsafe for normal habitation or unrestricted land use in the foreseeable future.The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is the officially designated area that surrounds the nuclear plant, from which routine habitation is excluded due to contamination. It was initially a 30 km radius circle, but over time it has been adjusted to cover the regions of highest fallout. Today, the CEZ in Ukraine spans roughly 2,600 km¬≤ (1,000 sq miles), an area nearly the size of Luxembourg. It is a mix of forest, marsh, and abandoned villages and towns. To the north, across the border, Belarus maintains its own 2,200 km¬≤ Polesie State Radiation-Ecological Reserve ‚Äì effectively an extension of the Exclusion Zone. Combined, the whole Chernobyl affected zone is about 4,300‚Äì4,400 km¬≤ of mostly evacuated land. Within the Ukrainian CEZ, the borders are secured by patrols and checkpoints. One cannot simply wander in; access is controlled by the Chernobyl Zone Authority under Ukraine‚Äôs State Emergency Service.<br>The zone remains almost completely devoid of permanent residents. In the chaotic months after the disaster, some residents‚Äîespecially older folks‚Äîwere heartbroken at the thought of never returning to their homes. Despite official prohibition, a number of evacuees later snuck back into the Exclusion Zone and resettled in their old villages. These people are known as the ‚Äúsamosely‚Äù (self-settlers). Over the years, authorities generally tolerated their presence in small numbers. At their peak in the late 80s and early 90s, around 1,200 samosely lived in the zone; today (as of the 2010s), only an aging few dozen to a couple hundred remain, as many have passed away due to old age (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). These residents live mostly in the outer parts of the zone, subsisting off gardens and pensions ‚Äì they often say they‚Äôd rather face radiation in their beloved homes than live in alien cities. They do receive occasional visits from doctors and supplies, but for the most part they live simply and accept whatever risk exists. Their presence is a poignant human facet of the zone, though they are a tiny exception.For everyone else, the Exclusion Zone is a strictly controlled area. The infrastructure of the zone consists of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant industrial site (where a few thousand workers and security personnel commute for monitoring and projects, working in shifts but not living there), and the town of Chernobyl (about 15 km south of the reactor). The town of Chernobyl (not to be confused with the plant itself) actually still functions as an administrative center for the zone ‚Äì a few hundred staff, scientists, and officers live there on rotations. It has dormitories, an operational canteen, and even two small hotels for visitors. However, this is not a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù town ‚Äì it‚Äôs more like a base camp, since everyone there is on limited stay and monitored for radiation dose.The rest of the zone is characterized by abandoned settlements. Pripyat, once a model city of 50,000, remains empty and decaying ‚Äì an urban time capsule of Soviet life in 1986. Dozens of villages similarly lie in ruins or are being reclaimed by vegetation. Over 200,000 hectares of the zone are wild land with no active human use. There are checkpoints at the 30 km and 10 km boundaries where dosimeters are used to check vehicles for contamination on exit.<br>Economically and administratively, the Exclusion Zone has been put to some new uses in recent years (covered under ‚ÄúTourism and Development‚Äù below, like solar farms and scientific research). But its status is essentially that of a restricted environmental reserve. In 2016 Ukraine designated the Exclusion Zone as a national biosphere radiological reserve, recognizing its unique environment. There has even been discussion by Ukrainian officials of seeking UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Pripyat and Chernobyl‚Äôs cultural landscape, to preserve it as a memorial and scientific site. (In 2021, on the 35th anniversary, Ukraine formally started the process to nominate the CEZ as a World Heritage Site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible Unesco World Heritage Site" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible%20Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site" target="_self">Ukraine Seeks to Designate Chernobyl as a Unesco World Heritage ...</a>), though the war has interrupted these plans.)The security of the zone came under threat during the 2022 Russian invasion, as noted. For the first time, armed conflict intruded into the CEZ. During the Russian occupation, not only was there concern of accidental damage, but also reports of looting (even theft of radioactive lab samples) and disruption of wildfire management. Post-occupation, Ukraine has to demine parts of the zone due to mines left behind. The episode highlighted that the Exclusion Zone remains important strategically ‚Äì it was a pathway for Russian forces towards Kyiv. After Russian withdrawal, Ukraine reasserted full control and the zone is back to being off-limits except for authorized personnel. The IAEA now has a permanent monitoring presence at Chernobyl as well.In conclusion, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone persists as a largely evacuated territory. It functions as a combination of a radiological reserve, an outdoor laboratory, a memorial landscape, and a buffer around the reactor site. With each passing year, the zone‚Äôs identity shifts more towards preservation and research. It stands as a remarkable example of how a large area, once meant for human habitation, has transformed following a technological disaster. Current conditions ensure that the zone will remain set apart for many years to come ‚Äì a place where time stopped in 1986, now gradually being reclaimed by nature, and cautiously visited by those seeking to understand and remember Chernobyl‚Äôs lessons.One of the most intriguing aspects of Chernobyl today is its thriving wildlife and transformed ecosystem. As mentioned in the long-term effects section, the removal of humans has allowed many animal populations to rebound dramatically. The Exclusion Zone has effectively become a wildlife sanctuary ‚Äì arguably one of the most unexpected nature preserves in the world.<br>Surveys and field research in the 2010s documented an abundance of large mammals. Wolves are considered the top predator in Chernobyl‚Äôs food chain now, and they range freely. A 2015 census using track counts and helicopter surveys found that Chernobyl‚Äôs wolf population was several times higher than in nearby non-contaminated reserves; prey like deer and wild boar were also plentiful (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The researchers reported ‚Äúno evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance‚Äù in the zone, noting that wildlife was doing well in the absence of people (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). This is not to say radiation has no effects, but any potential subtle effects have not prevented populations from growing. Another study published in 2015 in Current Biology concluded the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a ‚Äúunique sanctuary for wildlife‚Äù with greater biodiversity than before the accident, due to human absence (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).Numerous species have returned to the area. For instance, the Eurasian lynx, absent in the region for decades due to hunting and habitat loss, now prowls the forests again. Brown bears have been observed moving through the zone (these had long been gone from this part of Ukraine). The European bison, an endangered species, was introduced to the Ukrainian zone in the 2010s and has since formed a small herd. Przewalski‚Äôs horses ‚Äì critically endangered wild horses native to Central Asia ‚Äì were released in the late 1990s as an experiment; they thrived and now about 100 of them roam the grasslands near Pripyat, grazing around abandoned villages. Elk (moose) populations are stable, and wild boar are so numerous that they spill out of the zone into surrounding farmland. Birdlife is rich as well: species like black storks, white-tailed eagles, eagle owls, and others are commonly seen. Even rare species like the globally threatened Greater Spotted Eagle have been recorded nesting in the zone. The wetlands in the Pripyat River floodplain inside the CEZ serve as important habitat for migratory birds. Lakes and ponds hold healthy fish populations (famously, the cooling pond of the plant has giant catfish that tourists love to watch ‚Äì though their size is due to age and lack of fishing, not ‚Äúmutations‚Äù).<br>Scientists continue to study these animals to see how chronic radiation exposure might be affecting them. Some findings are intriguing: for example, Chernobyl‚Äôs birds have been found to adapt by producing more anti-oxidants to counter radiation‚Äôs oxidative stress. A study on Chernobyl‚Äôs wolves has even tracked them leaving the zone, suggesting the zone might be a source of animals repopulating other areas (raising the question of whether they could carry mutations outward ‚Äì though no evidence of any harmful spread has been observed). Another recent study (2023) on roundworms in the soil found that even after 1,000 generations in Chernobyl‚Äôs radionuclide-laden earth, the worms showed an ability to tolerate the radiation without significant genome damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the resurgence of a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the%20resurgence%20of%20a" target="_self">From disaster zone to living laboratory: Chernobyl provides test bed ...</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation,genomes of microscopic worms" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny%20Worms%20Tolerate%20Chornobyl%20Radiation,genomes%20of%20microscopic%20worms" target="_self">Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation - NYU</a>). This hints at potential resilience or repair mechanisms developed by life in the zone.That said, not every creature is thriving. Invertebrates and small mammals have shown mixed results in studies ‚Äì some have reduced populations in high radiation sectors. Tree growth can be stunted in those areas. There have been reports of some partial ‚Äúmutations‚Äù or anomalies: for instance, a higher frequency of albino barn swallows, or rodents with cataracts. But overall, the ecosystem functions: trees grow, leaves decompose (albeit slower at first), water bodies have oxygen and life, and a full trophic web (plants ‚Üí herbivores ‚Üí carnivores) is in place.The Exclusion Zone‚Äôs ecology has also benefited from deliberate protections. Since people aren‚Äôt farming or logging, forests have matured and expanded. In Belarus‚Äôs Polesie Reserve, there are large tracts of primeval-feeling forest that are home to lynx and wolves. Ukraine‚Äôs side set up the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve to coordinate ecological conservation and research.<br>Interestingly, the zone provides a case study on rewilding ‚Äì showing how quickly wildlife can reclaim an area when humans leave. Within 5-10 years of the evacuation, animals from surrounding regions started moving in. Now, Chernobyl is cited as evidence that nature can be remarkably resilient. The United Nations Environment Programme noted that the land around Chernobyl has become ‚Äúa haven for wildlife‚Äù in the absence of human activity (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers have found the land,become a haven for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20the%20land,become%20a%20haven%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">How Chernobyl has become an unexpected haven for wildlife - UNEP</a>). Some have even called it Europe‚Äôs own Serengeti (though that‚Äôs hyperbole; it is a rich temperate forest ecosystem, not a tropical savanna).It‚Äôs crucial to remember the wildlife success does not mean radiation is ‚Äúgood‚Äù for animals ‚Äì rather, it underscores how damaging human habitation can be for wildlife, by comparison. Chernobyl removed the anthropogenic pressures (hunting, farming, pollution other than radiation), and wildlife moved in despite the radiation risk. The long-term genetic consequences for these animal populations are still being studied. But as of now, the biosphere of Chernobyl is vibrant. Visitors often report seeing tracks of wolves and boar everywhere, hearing bird songs in empty villages, or even catching sight of a wild horse galloping across the steppe. It‚Äôs a striking contrast: a site of human catastrophe has, over time, transformed into an ‚Äúaccidental wilderness.‚Äù<br>In summary, the current ecosystem in the Chernobyl area is a mixture of contamination and regeneration. Forests have overtaken former towns; animals roam where people once worked and played. The zone stands as a unique refuge for biodiversity in Eastern Europe, with higher wildlife abundance than before 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Ongoing research in this living laboratory will continue to inform us about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation on living organisms and about nature‚Äôs capacity for resilience after human departure.In recent years, Chernobyl has evolved into a destination for controlled tourism and a site for innovative projects aimed at finding some positive purpose for the Exclusion Zone. Disaster tourism, or ‚Äúdark tourism,‚Äù has grown around Chernobyl, driven by curiosity, education, and the eerie allure of its post-apocalyptic landscape. At the same time, Ukraine has launched efforts to utilize the zone for renewable energy and scientific advancement, turning a place of tragedy into one of renewal.<br>Tourism: In 2011, Ukraine officially opened Chernobyl to tourism, recognizing the public interest and the zone‚Äôs educational value (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2011 Chernobyl was officially,tourist attraction%2C with many visitors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202011%20Chernobyl%20was%20officially,tourist%20attraction%2C%20with%20many%20visitors" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Since then, visiting Chernobyl has been possible via licensed tour operators. Tourists must apply in advance, submit their passport details (since it‚Äôs a secure area), and they enter on guided tours usually from Kyiv. These tours stick to relatively safe routes; visitors carry dosimeters and are briefed on safety (like not touching vegetation, not sitting on the ground, etc.). Typical tours include stops at the Chernobyl town (to see memorials and equipment graveyards), the Kopachi village ruins (where only a kindergarten building remains as a reminder), the Pripyat city (where one can carefully walk the deserted streets and see sites like the abandoned amusement park, swimming pool, and overgrown city square), and a distant view of the Reactor 4 complex and NSC from a safe distance. Some tours also visit the giant Duga-1 radar (‚ÄúRussian Woodpecker‚Äù) ‚Äì a huge abandoned Soviet radar installation in the zone. Tourists pass through radiation control gates when exiting to ensure they haven‚Äôt inadvertently picked up contamination (in practice, brief visitors rarely do).<br>Chernobyl tourism remained somewhat niche until the late 2010s when it saw a boom. The success of the 2019 HBO ‚ÄúChernobyl‚Äù miniseries brought a surge of interest ‚Äì tour agencies reported bookings jumping by 30-40% after the show aired (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One Chernobyl tour agency reported,which has attracted outstanding" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One%20Chernobyl%20tour%20agency%20reported,which%20has%20attracted%20outstanding" target="_self">HBO show success drives Chernobyl tourism boom - Reuters</a>). In 2018, roughly 70,000 tourists visited Chernobyl; in 2019, that number swelled to around 120,000 ‚Äì 125,000 visitors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl sees a spike in,to the 70%2C000 in 2018" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl%20sees%20a%20spike%20in,to%20the%2070%2C000%20in%202018" target="_self">Chernobyl sees a spike in visitors as pop culture influences tourism</a>).

These visitors come from all over the world, drawn by historical interest, a taste for adventure, or even wildlife photography. The Ukrainian government even considered expanding tourist infrastructure given the demand.Tourism has had positive effects: it raises awareness of the disaster‚Äôs lessons and provides income (each visitor pays fees that support zone maintenance and local communities outside the zone). Guides emphasize that Chernobyl is a site of remembrance ‚Äì there are memorials to firefighters and evacuees, and many tours include meeting an actual evacuee or a liquidator who can share their story. Visitors are often struck by the poignancy of places like Pripyat: an empty nursery with children‚Äôs toys still there, or murals peeling off school walls ‚Äì snapshots of 1980s Soviet life frozen in time. This ‚Äúopen-air museum‚Äù aspect is why preservationists have pushed for UNESCO status, to protect it from decay and looting.Tourism was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again in 2022 because of the war. As of 2023, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tourist access is suspended for security reasons. But prior to that, Chernobyl had firmly established itself as a tourist destination, and it likely will again when conditions normalize. It‚Äôs not a Disneyfied experience ‚Äì the trips are somber and heavily managed ‚Äì but it provides a powerful insight into nuclear history and its consequences.Restoration and Development Projects: While the land will be unsafe for farming or regular habitation for a long time, Ukraine has sought creative ways to utilize the Exclusion Zone. One idea has been to turn it into a hub for renewable energy. The reasoning: the zone has abundant land that cannot be used for agriculture, and it has existing high-voltage power lines (from when the plant generated electricity) that connect to the grid. So, why not install solar panels or wind turbines there?<br>In 2018, the first project materialized ‚Äì a 1 megawatt solar power plant was built within sight of the old reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The new one,first years of its operation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The%20new%20one,first%20years%20of%20its%20operation" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl‚Äôs nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Installed by a Ukrainian-German company, this solar farm consists of about 3,800 photovoltaic panels on a 1.6 hectare plot, right near the Chernobyl plant. It was connected to the grid and, symbolically, began generating power again at Chernobyl (the first electricity from the site since the last reactor shut down in 2000) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It is the first time,would never produce energy again" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20first%20time,would%20never%20produce%20energy%20again" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl‚Äôs nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). This small solar station powers about 2,000 homes, and plans were floated for expansion. The Ukrainian government has actively promoted the Exclusion Zone as a site for renewable energy projects, pitching that up to 2.5 GW of solar capacity could eventually be installed (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl‚Äôs nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Interest was shown by companies from China, France, and other countries in building solar farms in the late 2010s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl‚Äôs nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). The cheap land (effectively free, since it‚Äôs unusable for other purposes) and existing transmission lines make it economically attractive ‚Äì with the caveat that construction workers can only spend limited hours in the area for safety (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two years ago%2C a giant,reactor to be dismantled safely" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20giant,reactor%20to%20be%20dismantled%20safely" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl‚Äôs nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).<br>Similarly, in 2021 Ukraine announced plans for a large wind farm in the Exclusion Zone. In partnership with a European company, they envision up to 1 GW of wind energy capacity to be developed in the zone (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear option%3A Ukraine plans one,around the Chernobyl nuclear plant" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear%20option%3A%20Ukraine%20plans%20one,around%20the%20Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant" target="_self">Nuclear option: Ukraine plans one of Europe's largest wind farms in ...</a>). If realized, that would make it one of Europe‚Äôs biggest onshore wind farms. Such a project would further transform Chernobyl from a symbol of nuclear disaster into a contributor to clean energy production (without the risks of nuclear). As of the latest updates, these plans are on hold due to the war, but Ukraine has indicated strong interest in resuming them once it‚Äôs safe.Besides energy, the zone is used for scientific research and environmental monitoring. Ecologists, biologists, and radiologists from around the world work in the CEZ to study radiation effects on nature, remediation techniques, and even astrophysics (the low light pollution makes it good for certain telescopic observations). There have been projects to test robotic equipment for radiation mapping, to experiment with phytoremediation (using plants to extract radionuclides from soil), and to monitor wildfires via satellites. The zone‚Äôs administration also employs people in forestry (they actively manage some forests to reduce fire risk, by removing dry fuel). Some contaminated wood is harvested under careful conditions and used as biomass fuel in special power plants (with filtration) outside the zone ‚Äì a bit controversial, but an attempt to utilize resources while controlling pollution.One notable ‚Äúrestoration‚Äù in a cultural sense is the preservation of certain buildings. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself still has workers doing decommissioning. Tours can visit the control room of Reactor 4 now (in full gear, for a short 5-minute look) ‚Äì it was opened to very limited visiting in 2019 as part of raising awareness. The control room is, of course, contaminated and everything inside remains as it was after the accident (now with higher radiation levels), so such visits are symbolic. There is also the Chernobyl Museum in Kiev (Kyiv) which is outside the zone but dedicated to its history.One can‚Äôt mention restoration without noting that Chernobyl will never be ‚Äúrestored‚Äù to its pre-1986 state in the literal sense. The goal is more about containment and adaptation. The current strategy (per international plans) is to keep the reactor area safe and start removing the fuel debris between now and 2065, package the waste, and then possibly begin to dismantle the NSC and other structures after that. Meanwhile, large parts of the Exclusion Zone may be left to nature indefinitely. Some areas with lower contamination could potentially be opened for limited use sooner ‚Äì for example, a few outer villages were reclassified in the 2010s to allow former residents to visit or even live with some restrictions (particularly in parts of Belarus). But for the most contaminated core zones, the ‚Äúno man‚Äôs land‚Äù will persist for many generations ‚Äì essentially as a wildlife reserve and historical monument.Latest updates (as of early 2025): The war in Ukraine has introduced uncertainties ‚Äì for instance, the renewable projects are paused, and the zone occasionally faces security issues. But the NSC and other safety systems are functioning. Ukraine‚Äôs government remains committed to integrating the zone into its future plans (President Zelensky in 2020 declared Chernobyl a place of ‚Äúspecial importance‚Äù that should be turned from a negative into a positive symbol). There‚Äôs talk of developing better infrastructure for tourists and researchers once it‚Äôs feasible.Chernobyl has also become part of global pop culture and education. Documentaries and movies abound. The site draws not only tourists but also journalists, scientists, and even video game designers (the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is set in a fictionalized Chernobyl zone). This human engagement with Chernobyl today is part of its ongoing story ‚Äì ensuring that the lessons of 1986 are not forgotten and that maybe something constructive can arise from the tragedy.<br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was a cataclysmic event with causes rooted in design flaws and human error, producing immediate devastation to human life and the environment. Its immediate consequences included loss of life, widespread radioactive contamination, and political upheaval. Over the long term, it has had complex health outcomes (notably thousands of thyroid cancers, but surprisingly limited other health impacts according to UNSCEAR) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), and it left a profound mark on ecology ‚Äì decimating some aspects of the environment while inadvertently creating a wildlife haven. The disaster also influenced geopolitical currents, hastening the Soviet Union‚Äôs end and reshaping global nuclear policy.Cleanup efforts were unprecedented in scale ‚Äì from the half-million liquidators who risked their health, to the massive engineering feats of containment with the sarcophagus and New Safe Confinement. Today, Chernobyl stands in a state of stable containment: radiation is largely confined, Reactor 4 is entombed under the new arch, and the area is under constant monitoring. The surrounding Exclusion Zone has transformed into a unique sanctuary for biodiversity and a living museum of the anthropocene. Current radiation levels in most of the zone are low enough to allow visits, although the land will not be fully ‚Äúclear‚Äù for normal life for centuries in the most affected parts.<br>Chernobyl‚Äôs story is still unfolding ‚Äì it‚Äôs a story of warning about the dangers of nuclear power without proper safety, but also a story of resilience (of people and nature). Efforts continue in making the site useful ‚Äì whether generating solar electricity or providing invaluable scientific data on radiation‚Äôs effects. As of today, Chernobyl is both a monument to a past disaster and a dynamic environment of recovery. It remains a sobering reminder of the costs of human error, and a testament to international cooperation in mitigating a disaster‚Äôs aftermath.

The capacity to maintain one's own identity (thoughts, values, and beliefs) while remaining emotionally connected to others. <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> introduced this concept to explain how individuals manage anxiety and stress by separating thinking from emotional reactivity. Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. Example. An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. Example. An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. Example. A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. Clinical implication Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/final-project/project-outline.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/Final Project/Project Outline.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:33:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Untitled Kanban]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adolescent7<a aria-label="More options" class="kanban-plugin__lane-settings-button clickable-icon"><span data-icon="lucide-more-vertical" class="kanban-plugin__icon "><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-more-vertical"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="1"></circle><circle cx="12" cy="5" r="1"></circle><circle cx="12" cy="19" r="1"></circle></svg></span></a>You aced a difficult exam, but you studied with a friend you parents don't approve of.<a data-ignore-drag="true" aria-label="More options" class="kanban-plugin__item-postfix-button clickable-icon"><span data-icon="lucide-more-vertical" class="kanban-plugin__icon "><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-more-vertical"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="1"></circle><circle cx="12" cy="5" r="1"></circle><circle cx="12" cy="19" r="1"></circle></svg></span></a>You went to a party, and there was underage drinking.

Family Influences]]></title><description><![CDATA[I. OverviewThis document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:
The impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.
Parental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.
The interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.
The importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.
II. Key Themes and FindingsA. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)
Core Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.
Key Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.
"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
Secrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.
Increased secrecy is linked to "stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret."
Implications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.
B. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)
Core Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).
Key Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (œÅ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).
Psychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.
Parental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
Cultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.
Implications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.
C. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)
Core Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.
Key Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms
Greater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.
"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
Racial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety
Implications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.
D. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)
Core Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.
Key Findings:"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
LGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.
Latino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents
Implications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.
III. Quotes
Frijns et al. (2010): "Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
Liu et al. (2020): "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
Montoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): "Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
Ryan et al. (2010): "Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
IV. Overall ImplicationsThese studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on strengthening family bonds, addressing both cultural and economic stressors, and promoting positive family dynamics to support healthy adolescent development.]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/7.-family-influences.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/7.

Title: A qualitative examination of familial racial-ethnic socialization experiences among multiracial American emerging adults., Author: Atkin, Annabelle L.; Jackson, Kelly F.; White, Rebecca M. B.; Tran, Alisia G. T. T.; Journal: Journal of Family Psychology, Volume: 36,
Issue: 2

This qualitative interview study investigated the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages received by Multiracial American youth over the course of their development. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The Ô¨Åndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.

Virginia case. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18. There is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families. Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict. <br><a data-href="Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)</a> <br><a data-href="Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation</a> Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.
This model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development. Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.
MultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status. Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth: Cultural Socialization Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. Racial Identity Socialization Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves. Preparation for Bias Messages Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. Egalitarian Socialization Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same Negative Socialization Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial Exposure to Diversity Messages Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. No Racial-Ethnic Socialization Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews Racial Identity Socialization
Preparation for Bias Socialization
Colorblind Socialization
Diversity Appreciation Socialization
Race-Conscious Socialization
Exposure to Diversity Socialization
Negative Socialization
Silent Socialization Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture. Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures. Language Socialization There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group. Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned. "You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such." Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them. Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.
One way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@atkinqualitativeexaminationfamilial2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

The biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence stimulate young people to think about themselves, reÔ¨Çect on the kind of people they want to become, and Ô¨Ånd their place in society. Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson‚Äôs theory and Marcia‚Äôs identity status model, but process-oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents Ô¨Ånd a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well-being.

Teaching and talking about race and ethnicity with children and adults is especially important in racially diverse societies. This process has been coined racial/ethnic socialization (RES). Despite the importance of RES, we still know very little about how this process unfolds in the lives of White youth. Thus, from a social, cognitive, and developmental perspective, the authors summarize Ô¨Åndings from empirical research and theory on RES for White youth across stages of development‚Äîearly childhood through young adulthood. Since RES is linked with cross-group attitudes (e.g., less bias, prejudice, stereotyping) and behaviors (e.g., inclusion), we highlight future directions for research and discuss applications for existing Ô¨Åndings for an increasingly diverse society.

Title: Ethnic‚ÄìRacial Socialization in the Family: A Decade's Advance on Precursors and Outcomes, Author: Uma√±a‚ÄêTaylor, Adriana J.; Hill, Nancy E.; Journal: Journal of Marriage and Family, Volume: 82,

Abstract
In the current decade, the U.S. population reached historically high levels of ethnic‚Äìracial diversity and reelected the nation's first Black‚ÄìWhite biracial President. Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic‚Äìracial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‚Äêseated ethnic‚Äìracial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic‚Äìracial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic‚Äìracial socialization in this decade. Furthermore, although it is clear that family ethnic‚Äìracial socialization is a robust predictor of youths' adjustment, the associations between socialization and adjustment must be considered with attention to specific socialization strategies, the confluence of strategies used, and the unique contexts within which families' lives are embedded.

Cultural-¬≠ecological theories posit that ethnic-r¬≠ acial identity (ERI) development is shaped by transactions between contexts of ethnic-¬≠racial socialization, yet research considering intersections among multiple contexts is limited. In this study, Black, Latino, White, and Asian American adolescents (N = 98; Mage = 16.26, SD = 1.09; 55.1% female identifying) participated in surveys and focus group discussions (2013‚Äì¬≠2014) to share insights into ERI development in context. Using consensual qualitative research, results indicated: (a) family ethnic-¬≠racial socialization intersects with community-¬≠based, peer, media, and school socialization; (b) ethnic-¬≠ racial socialization occurs outside family through intersections between peer, school, community-¬≠based, and media settings; and (c) ethnic-r¬≠ acial socialization is embedded within systems of racial oppression across contexts. Discussion includes implications for future research and interventions supporting youth ERI.

Title: Beyond Simple Models of Self-Control to Circuit-Based Accounts of Adolescent Behavior, Author: Casey, B. J.; Journal: Annual Review of Psychology, Volume: 66,
Issue: 1
Pages: 295-319

Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood that begins around the onset of puberty and ends with relative independence from the parent. This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm‚Äôs way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control‚Äîthe ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciÔ¨Åc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.

The dual-system based largely on Metcalf &amp; Mischel's (1999) two-system model of willpower. According to the model, self-control results from a balance between a 'cool' and a 'hot' system. The cool system is an emotionally neutral, strategic, and flexible cognitive system. The hot system is emotionally driven by fears, desires, and reflexes. The balance between these two system varies as a function of the individual, development, and stress. The dual-system model was used to heuristically explain brain systems underlying behavior involving immediate versus delayed rewards.

Developmental Systems Perspective Adolescent development is best understood as a dynamic interplay between the individual and their changing context. Long-term impact of adolescence While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. Developmental Systems Model This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. This model emphasizes Change and Relative Plasticity Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development Relationism and Integration Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. Historical Embeddedness and Temporality Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. Implications for Research and Application This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions. 'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes. This knowledge will inform effective policies and interventions to maximize the positive potential of adolescence for individuals and society as a whole.

Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually Œ±=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: Œ≤1 = 0
H1: Œ≤1 ‚â† 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)

H1: œÅ &gt; 0
H0: œÅ2 = 0

An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also.

Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File

You will continue to use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2011 Cohort.&nbsp;The classwork/homework write-up is due by Tuesday at 11:59PM (3/18).&nbsp;The data you need come from two sources. The first is the data file you have been working on for class activities the last several week. The second is located in this week's folder. A researcher wants to know whether maternal depressive symptoms are associated with children‚Äôs early learning and development. But before the researcher can address this question, you are asked to think about and address missing data. The researcher has provided you with several variables in addition to the variables you have worked with thus far:
You are asked to include an overall composite of depressive symptoms. The research provides you with 12 items that you are asked to composite (P2BOTHER P2APPETI P2BLUE P2KPMIND P2DEPRES P2EFFORT P2FEARFL P2RESTLS P2TALKLS P2LONELY P2SAD P2NOTGO).
You will also include three child variables: a) a variable capturing children‚Äôs academic achievement, b) a variable capturing children‚Äôs socioemotional skills, and c) a variable capturing children‚Äôs executive functioning. For the academic achievement measure, you will need to create a new composite variable that is composed of reading, math, and science (X2RSCALK4 X2MSCALK4 X2SSCALK4). For socioemotional skills, you will need to create a new variable that is the average of teacher reports of self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior (i.e.,&nbsp;X2TCHINT X2TCHEXT X2TCHCON X2TCHPER). Children‚Äôs executive functioning skills are captured with a single item:&nbsp;X2DCCSTOT.
The researcher also wants you to include covariates/indicators for race/ethnicity (X_RACETH_R), child sex (X_CHSEX_R), income (X2INCCAT_I), parents‚Äô marital status (P1CURMAR), parents physical health (P2HEALTH), household members under 18 (X1LESS18), and household members over 18 (X1OVER18) .
With that in mind...Step 1: You need to merge the new data into the dataset you have been working with. This requires a 1 to 1 merge using CHILDID. This step will be graded via your do/log files (.25 points)Step 2: Once the data are merged, examine your data. Orient yourself to the old and new variables (e.g., are they continuous, categorical etc etc) and&nbsp;recode&nbsp;any new variables as appropriate. Recall how Stata recognizes missing data. Please also&nbsp;create&nbsp;the appropriate composites&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to imputation. The composites will be what you will use in your imputation.&nbsp;If you recode other variables, please provide a justification. This step will be graded via your do/log files and your justification in your word document. (.25 points) Step 3: Once you have cleaned your data,&nbsp;run&nbsp;some descriptives for all of your variables (including your covariates) and determine the degree of missing values for each variable. Please also estimate a correlation matrix for your focal independent and dependent variables (do&nbsp;not&nbsp;include the list of covariates for your correlation matrix). What &nbsp;patterns you notice from the descriptive statistics? How much missing data are there for the variables? What patterns do you notice from the correlation matrix? (1.00 point) Step 4:&nbsp;Determine&nbsp;whether data are MCAR. Examine and discuss the missing data patterns. Are there common patterns of missing data? Are there uncommon patterns of missing data? Anything you notice worth discussing? If data are not MCAR, discuss whether the data may meet assumptions of MAR or MNAR. Why or why not? If you have any concerns proceeding to imputation, discuss it here. (1.25 points) Step 5:&nbsp;Run&nbsp;an imputation model with 10 datasets. Make sure you specify each variable correctly. And remember to&nbsp;upload&nbsp;your do and log files (for the entire assignment). This step will be graded via your do file (1.00 point) Step 6: After you have run your imputation,&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;descriptives&nbsp;within&nbsp;the 10 imputed datasets. You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to do this for every variable. Run these descriptives for the focal variables of interest (depressive symptoms, children's academic achievement, social skills, and executive functioning). Use the mi xeq command (e.g., mi xeq: sum XYZ). Discuss what you notice about the means/SDs across the imputations. (1.00 point)Step 7.&nbsp;Estimate&nbsp;correlations (use mi xeq: corr) among your focal variables from step 1, but this time&nbsp;within&nbsp;your 10 datasets. Are there any similarities between the imputed and non-imputed data? Are there any other differences you notice? (.75 points) Step 8. Upload your word document, log file, and do file. Please upload stata versions of your log/do files (not copied/pasted into word).]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Assignment 4.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:51:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mediation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mediation" data-href="Mediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glm-2/mediation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Single Mediation</a><br>

Mediation examines how the effect of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) is transmitted through a third variable, called the mediator (M). In simple mediation, there is one mediator. To determine if the IV influences the DV directly and/or indirectly via the mediator. The model splits the total effect into The portion of the effect of IV on DV that is not explained by the mediator. The portion of the effect that is transmitted from IV to DV through the mediator. Relationships among IV, mediator, and DV are linear. Scatterplots: Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot and plot DV vs. IV and DV vs. M. Look for a straight-line pattern. Residuals vs. Predicted Plot: Run Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear‚Ä¶; click Plots‚Ä¶ to assign standardized predicted values (X-axis) and standardized residuals (Y-axis).
Criteria: No systematic pattern (i.e., randomness, with any curve test yielding p &gt; .05). Residuals have constant variance across all levels of predictors. Examine the same residuals vs. predicted plot for an even spread (no funnel shape). Residuals are approximately normally distributed. Create histograms and Q‚ÄìQ plots using Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram or Q‚ÄìQ plot options. Criteria: Skewness values less than |2.0| and kurtosis values less than |7.0|; Q‚ÄìQ plot points should lie near the diagonal line. Observations are independent. Confirm via your study design.
Review the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic from your regression output (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable). There are no unmeasured variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and DV. This is primarily a design issue; however, consider including control variables if needed. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX by Andrew Hayes
Choose Model 4 (designed for simple mediation).
Set the DV, IV, and mediator in the appropriate boxes.
Enable bootstrapping (commonly set to 5,000 samples) to obtain robust confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effect.
Click OK. Direct Path (IV ‚Üí M): Example: a = 0.40, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path from Mediator to DV (M ‚Üí DV, controlling for IV): Example: b = 0.50, SE = 0.12, p = .002 Indirect Effect (a √ó b): Example: 0.40 √ó 0.50 = 0.200.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.08, 0.35] (does not include zero ‚Üí significant mediation). Direct Effect (IV ‚Üí DV controlling for M):
Example: c‚Ä≤ = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005
Total Effect (IV ‚Üí DV without mediator):
Example: c = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001 A mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to examine whether [Mediator] mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The total effect of [IV] on [DV] was significant (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001). When [Mediator] was entered into the model, the direct effect decreased (b = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005). The indirect effect was significant (b = 0.20, SE = 0.07, 95% CI [0.08, 0.35]), indicating that [Mediator] partially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator(s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV ‚Üí Mediator 1 ‚Üí DV IV ‚Üí Mediator 2 ‚Üí DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. each mediator.
Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q‚ÄìQ plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic (1.5‚Äì2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a1 = 0.30, b1 = 0.40 ‚Üí Indirect effect = 0.30 √ó 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a2 = 0.25, b2 = 0.35 ‚Üí Indirect effect = 0.25 √ó 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c‚Ä≤ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.‚Äù Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. predicted plots for each link: IV ‚Üí M1, M1 ‚Üí M2, and M2 ‚Üí DV.
Use histograms and Q‚ÄìQ plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin‚ÄìWatson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M1 influences M2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M2 on M1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
Click Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV ‚Üí Mediator 1: Example: a1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 ‚Üí Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 ‚Üí DV (controlling for IV and M1):
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
Sequential Indirect Effect (IV ‚Üí M1 ‚Üí M2 ‚Üí DV):
Calculation: a1 √ó d √ó b2 = 0.35 √ó 0.45 √ó 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV ‚Üí DV controlling for mediators):
Example: c‚Ä≤ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation. Check Assumptions in SPSS: Generate scatterplots, residual vs. predicted plots, histograms, and Q‚ÄìQ plots.
Verify diagnostic values: skewness (&lt; |2.0|), kurtosis (&lt; |7.0|), Durbin‚ÄìWatson (1.5‚Äì2.5), and inter-mediator correlations (r &lt; 0.80 for parallel mediation).
For serial mediation, confirm intermediate regression steps are significant (p &lt; .05). Conduct Mediation Analysis with PROCESS: Use the appropriate model: Model 4 for simple and parallel mediation; Model 6 for serial mediation.
Enter variables as specified and enable bootstrapping (commonly 5,000 samples) to generate 95% confidence intervals. Interpret Output: Evaluate p-values for each path (significant if p &lt; .05).
For indirect effects, confirm that bootstrapped confidence intervals do not include zero. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glm-2/mediation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/Mediation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 21:32:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[7. Sampling & Complex Designs]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Why should we strive for population representative sampling? Important for policy or practice. We do not want to recommend changes that are not based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact. How? Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)
Work on large teams
Use secondary data Normally used to compensate for over- and under-sampling of individuals
Example It is common to over-sample minority groups... If we doubled the size of our minority sample, then each minority case would get a design weight of 1/2 or .5. We use the design weight when we want the statistics to be representative of the population. Used to compensate for the fact that persons with certain characteristics are not as likely to respond to the survey. Example Most population surveys have substantially more female than male respondents; because surveys over-represents females and under-represents males in the population, a weight is used to compensate for this bias. There are many responsent characteristics that are likely to be related to the propensity to respond such as age, education, race/ethnicity, place of residence. Dataset with cases Simple mean (4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 2.8 Weighted mean {(4 1) + (2 2) + (1 4) + (5 1) + (2 * 2)} / 10 = 2.1 With unweighted data, each case is counted equally
With weighted data, each case is counted relative to its representation in the population
Unweighted data represent only those in the sample who provide data
Weights allow analyses that represent the target population
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs.png" target="_self"> Most STATA commands can deal with weighted data, where the weight is a variable in the dataset. You need to specify the type of weight and the weight variable, using brackets at the end of your command, as in:
summarize x [weight=weightvarname]
tab x [weight=weightvarname]
regress y x [weight=weightvarname]
There are 4 types of weights in STATA, but for most data analyses you will use one of the following: Probability pweights, for observations sampled with unequal probability of selection. Use this for inferential analyses.
Analytic aweights, for data containing averages where the average is weighted by the # obs used in calculating the average‚Ä¶. Use this for your descriptive statistics. <br><img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-1.png" target="_self">
Different studies create different types of weights... Some data create weights depending on: Level of analysis (child, teacher, or school)
Type of analysis (cross-sectional vs. Longitudinal)
Source of data (child assessment, parent interview, teacher questionnaires, etc.)
For example, the ECLS-K has ~ 105 different options Many suggest you use combination weights when estimating longitudinal analyses because they assume that these users will not adjust for attrition on their own. I suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights. Instead, use modern missing data procedures for attrition bias, and use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias I make this recommendation because attrition weights have two key disadvantages Attrition weights often reduce the analytical sample size, and thereby, statistical power. If many non-model variables related to missing data are incorporated, missing data techniques adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights Use weights whenever possible, but some methods do not allow weights
Steps to follow to avoid vias in unweighted analyses <br>Include as <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> that might account for the sample design or non-response
<br>If a weight is available, it can also be included as an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a>
If the weight is associated with the outcom ein a model including the design variables, then the weight is likely to have been constructed in a way related to your outcome; bias is possile. E.g., some multilevel models, some structural equation programs, etc. National samples are first divided into primary sampling units... What these units are depends on the study.
- E.g., in many data of the US the PSUs are geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-2.png" target="_self"> After identifying PSUs, then PSUs are stratified into groups. These groups are formed to keep similar units together... How many and what types of strata are determined by study goals.<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-3.png" target="_self">
Then within each strata, and within PSUs, you sample Software can make the adjustment... A few different approaches with the easiest being the Taylor Series approach Use primary sampling unit (PSU) and strata variables in the data file. The strata and PSU identifiers are often associated with a specific sampling weight variable. For example, in the ECLS-K the weight C1CW0 has the following strata and PSU: C1TVWSTR and C1TCWPSU svyset PSU [pweight = WEIGHT], strata(STRATA)
Then use svy: before your subsequent commands (e.g., svy: tab or svy: mean or svy: regress)
svy: will NOT work with all commands
svy: mean and mean [weight = weight] yield the same mean estimates‚Ä¶ it is the SEs that are different)<br>

<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-5.png" target="_self"> Weights should be used when analyzing data from national samples; otherwise, you cannot make claims about representativeness
The appropriate weight should be selected based on: Level of analysis
Round (s) of data
Source (s) of data There may not be a 'perfect' weight for many analyses
All statistical tests should be based on standard errors that account for complex sample design

Conditioning on such risk factors is necessary to remove bias. Do NOT use p-values to determine covariate inclusion. Use a priori theory!

Variable Selection &amp; Data Relationships-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/6.-variable-selection-&amp;-data-relationships-2.png" target="_self"> As you are making decisions regarding your variables, consider the following questions: How will constructs be operationalized?
What items will be used and which measures are critical to the tests?
If multiple measures are available, what will be done? These issues often require quite a bit of conceptual considerations and defending in the peer-review process. In big datasets, measures are often abbreviated. Measurement problems arise when The concept to be measured are vague or poorly defined
Indicators are imperfect measures of the underlying construct
Individual responses are inaccurate (e.g., distraction, illness, poor comprehension)
Errors lead to erroneous values Accuracy The closeness of the measurement to the true value Bias A systematic variation of measurements from the quality being measured Precision The closeness of repeated measurements to one another <br><img alt="6.

The vast majority of constructs require more than one item, Why? Low content validity (sensitivity and reliability) The primary objective of creating a series of composite scales is to avoid the exclusive use of, or dependence on, single item constructs where possible. The use of several variables as indicators provides an opportunity to represent differing facets of a given concept, with the aim of yielding a more well-rounded perspective and, arguably, a better measure.

Why do we test for reliability in subpopulations? Establish the psychometric properties of a new or existing measure/assessment tool Means for determining generalizeability
Are we measuring the same construct in the same way across groups or across time? Increase confidence that observed differences between groups reflect true differences and not those ties to measurement. Reliability within subgroups is often assumed but rarely tested and is a big issue for many datasets that do not use previously validated meaures. Why use existing composites? Data availability: you often may not have all necessary data to create the composite
Reproducibility: everyone uses the same construct
Convenience: time and effort spent on identifying possible composites and determining best source of information to creating them But first, always read the user's guide and when item level data are available, check yourself!

Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. Predicted plots for each link: IV ‚Üí M 1, M 1 ‚Üí M 2, and M 2 ‚Üí DV.
Use histograms and Q‚ÄìQ plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin‚ÄìWatson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M 1 influences M 2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M 2 on M 1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
Click Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV ‚Üí Mediator 1: Example: a 1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 ‚Üí Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 ‚Üí DV (controlling for IV and M 1):
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
Sequential Indirect Effect (IV ‚Üí M 1 ‚Üí M 2 ‚Üí DV):
Calculation: a 1 √ó d √ó b 2 = 0.35 √ó 0.45 √ó 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV ‚Üí DV controlling for mediators):
Example: c‚Ä≤ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation.

Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator (s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV ‚Üí Mediator 1 ‚Üí DV IV ‚Üí Mediator 2 ‚Üí DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. Each mediator.
Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. Predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q‚ÄìQ plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic (1.5‚Äì2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a 1 = 0.30, b 1 = 0.40 ‚Üí Indirect effect = 0.30 √ó 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a 2 = 0.25, b 2 = 0.35 ‚Üí Indirect effect = 0.25 √ó 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c‚Ä≤ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.‚Äù

Although there is a positive effect of mom_iq on kidscore, the magnitude of the effect (the slope) is higher for children whose parents did not graduate high school (the blue line). Let's say that we have a theory that the more time you spend with a puppy, the happier you are. Also, the amount of love you have for puppies will moderate that effect. We will use the puppy_love dataset to run this scenario in PROCESS, but there are a few things to note: Make sure all variables you are using are 8 characters or less in length

This first part of the output shows us the model we built including the model number, our N, and the model summary. Model summary includes the R2 value, which in this case shows a significant amount of variance explained (37.63%) Below, in the 'Model' table, you can see the coefficients for the intercept as well as for the slopes of Dose, Love of Puppies, and the automatically created interaction term. Just below that you see that the interaction term is dose x puppylove<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-15.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-15.png" target="_self"> This next significant table shows us the conditional effects of W at the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentiles. Here, we see that when puppy love is at the 16 th percentile (puppy love = 1), the effect is 1.81 (p = .0013). Likewise, when puppy love is at the 50 th percentile (2.5), the effect is also significant (p = .0046) at 1.1694. However, the effect is no longer significant at the 84 th percentile for puppy love, (p &gt; .05).<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-16.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-16.png" target="_self"> The next table is the Johnson-Newman results. The Johnson-Newman approach looks for the values of W, where the p-values of the conditional effect changes to above/below the chosen significance level (. 05). So, it looks for the values of W that cause t-crit value to equal zero for when determining the conditional effect of X, where the p-value is exactly the alpha, or .05 in most cases. At what values of W, do the results go from significant to non-significant, or vice-versa, in terms of conditional effect?
Your results can either be of one, two, or zero values. If there is one value, that means there is only one value of W where the conditional effect either becomes significant or loses significance. If there are two values, that means there are two points at which W will change in significance. This will either mean the middle range is significant, but not the high and low values of W, or that the high and low values of W are significant, but not the middle range. The middle range is determined by the W values themselves. If there are no values, then the conditional effect is either always significant or never significant for all values of W. Next are graphical representations for what different types of Johnson-Newman results may look like. Where the line cross .05, that's where this approach looks for the value of W, giving us more insight into what extent our moderator... Well, moderates.<br>

See that the Johnson-Newman technique gave us only one value, 3.3364. By finding the value in the table below, we can see that the conditional effect is significant before W = 3.3364, but non-significant after that point. So, it is significant with lower levels of puppy love. (First column, row 3.3364)<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-20.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-20.png" target="_self"> The moderator (puplove) has significant impact on the relationship between time spent with Puppies and Happiness, only at its low values (i.e., from 0.00 to 3.3364) This implies that, the less an individual loves a puppy, the more time spent with puppy affect (increases) their happiness. At its higher values, the moderator (puplove) does not have a significant effect on the relationship between time spent with Puppies (focal predictor) and Happiness (outcome variable) This implies that, increasing the time spent with Puppy does not affect/change (increases) happiness for individuals who already love Puppies. The next part of the table give us the syntax to generate the plot<br>

<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-24.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-24.png" target="_self">
This is what your chart should look like now. You can now have lines that can help you to visualize the changes in X vs. Y, given the subgroups of W. Pretend that literature shows that the more someone loves puppies, the happier they are. We would like to test that theory, but with a moderator of time spent with puppies during a trial (dose).
Here, we are recognizing that Dose is a multi-categorical variable for control group (0 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes with puppies).
Typically, we would need to dummy-code these variables, but PROCESS does it for you, provided you remember one extra step. First, set up the model as usual in PROCESS. Note. Where the variables are in the image based on the new hypothesis. Next click on 'Multicategorical'<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-25.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-25.png" target="_self">
The next pop-up you will get is the multicategorical box. Here, you will select the checkbox under 'Variable W' to indicate that your moderator is multicategorical. Note. The other options, indicating that you can also do this for any X or Z variables(s) that have 3 or more categories. Click Continue.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-26.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-26.png" target="_self">
Click OK. One of the changes is the dummy coding. The coding scheme is provided just below the model overview and will look something like the table below.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-27.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-27.png" target="_self">
The next change is the model and product terms key tables. Just keep in mind the W coding scheme from before when interpreting each line, since now we are recognizing the separate levels of our W.
The final change is the set-up of the conditional effects table. Usually, this will either be representative of the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentile (default), or the means +/- 1 SD (if selected). However, now since we are recognizing W as a categorical variable, the doses are listed as the separate categories.
- Note how there is no mention of the percentiles in the 'Analysis Notes and Errors' section.<br>

Good fit Minimized error and strong correspondence between observed and predicted values (e.g., a large R-squared) F MSR / MSE provides overall statistical test of model fit H0 (Null Hypothesis) (x variable (s) do not predict y) With no better predictions than population mean of y H1 (Alternative Hypothesis) (x variable (s) do predict y) with better predictions than population mean of y. Mathematically accounting for the influence of another parameter on the relation between x and y.
When predictors are correlated, they potentially have shared or overlapping explained variance in Y. We need to consider the unique contribution of each.
Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient (r) does NOT do this. Squaring an r statistic is only useful when there is only one predictor (R-squared)
Unique correlations are needed to account for multiple predictors: Partial (first-order) Correlation

Most common! Predicting variation in an outcome variable (y) based on changes in predictor variables (x1, x2, etc.)

Where the action is. Each row conveys information about the regression equation that SPSS produced as the 'best fitting' model.
Unstandardized coefficients are easier to interpret, but standardized coefficients are more useful for including in manuscripts (apples to apples instead of apples to oranges)
Significance level of .05 is standard, though more stringent p-values can be employed to address weaknesses in design. Zero-order correlations represent the standard correlation between each x and y
Partial and part correlations should be squared manually prior to interpretation. Squared partial correlation represents the variance remaining in y after factoring out the x variable. Squared part (semi-partial) correlation represents the unique variance explained in y by the x variable. Tolerance reflects the proportion of the variance in x that is not predictable from other x predictor variables. 0-1 with zero meaning no new contribution and one meaning completely uncorrelated with the other predictors. <br>VIF indicates the degree of similarity between an x variable and at least one other x variable in the model.

Think of dummy coding as light switches. 1 ('on') means group membership and 0 ('off') means no group membership. Dummy coding means giving every case k-1 variables that indicate group membership.
For the school variable So, someone from Cline elementary would have the following values for group membership: AEC = 0, Campbell County High = 0, Campbell County MS = 0, Campbell County Elementary = 0, Cline = 1, Crossroads = 0, Grants Lick = 0, Reiley = 0 k-1 groups are used to fully capture group membership. A 'reference' category is selected to represent group membership when all values are zero. Typically, the reference category is the most often selected category. For example, Campbell County High School has roughly 49% of the data in our sample dataset, meaning that category should be selected as the referent. Coefficients are interpreted as the mean differences between the reference category and the category in question. <br><img alt="2.

Sometime, interpreting the intercept becomes difficult or meaningless, especially when we are dealing with variables like IQ, SAT scores, etc.
We have to use what is termed as 'mean-centering' That is creating a new variable by simply subtracting the mean from each individual observation
E.g., Centered IQi = IQi - IQ-bar (mean of IQ scores) ** Centering mom_iq.
** Note that the mean for mom's IQ is 100
COMPUTE iq_c = mom_iq - 100

1 - CDF.CHSQ(MAH_1,2) Degrees of freedom is 2 because we have two predictors According to Tabachnick &amp; Fidell (2013), the recommended threshold p-value is .001. So, cases with p-values less than .001 indicates significant outliers on the predictors.<br>

The scatterplot shows an inverse relationship between Mahal Distance and the associated p-values. So, if the p-value of the maximum Mahal distance (Check the 'Residual Statistics Table') is greater than the threshold of .001, you can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictor(s).
You do not even have to check the Mahal distance for individual cases. The absolute values of DfFITS (i.e., |SDF_1|) tells us the magnitude of the effect an individual case have on the predicted values. This indicates that, the SDF_1, similar to the Cook's distance, help examine the influence of some cases on the predicted values. Cases with absolute values of DfFITS greater than 2 (i.e., |SDF_1| &gt; 2) should be examined. <br><img alt="4.

Since the maximum absolute value is .33205, which is not greater than 2, we can conclude that there is no issue with an influential outlier(s). Helps examine whether a case is influential on the intercept or the slopes. The case should first be considered influential by looking at the D and/or the DfFITS. A case with an DfBeta greater than 2 can be said to have greater influence on the regression parameter in question (Pituch &amp; Stevens, 2016). This case then has to be investigated.<br>

The maximum absolute DFBETA (i.e., |DFBETA|) value for all the regression parameters (i.e., the intercept and the slopes) are less than 2, hence we can conclude that none of the cases have relatively high influence on our regression parameters. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glm-2/in-class-content/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/In-Class Content/4.

The change in the dependent (outcome) variable for a one unit change in the independent (predictor) variable, while holding all other variables constant.
Expressed in the original units of the dependent (outcome) and independent (predictor) variables. The values obtained after standardizing all variables (both dependent and independent variables) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
This allows for the newly calculated variables to represent the change in the dependent variable (in standard deviations) for one-standard deviation change in the value of the independent variable. Measures the relationship between two variables without controlling for any other variable(s) using simple correlation.
We would use this when we want to understand the simple bivariate relationship between two variables.
We would likely use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient R for this type of analysis. Measures the correlation between x and y while controlling for x2 (on both x and y).
We would likely use this when we want to understand the direct relationship between two variables, independent of influence of other variables. Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of one or more variables on only one of the two variables.

We would likely use this when we want to understand the exact contribution of an independent (predictor) variable to the dependent (outcome) variable, after taking into account the influence of other variables on the independent (predictor) variable. All predictors are added into the regression model at the same time.
The model evaluates the contribution of each predictor to the outcome variable while controlling for all other predictors.
R-squared is a static value that represents the variance explained in the outcome variable by the collective set of predictors.

Variables with non-zero values should be ‚Äòcentered‚Äô Predictors are entered into the model in a pre-specified order based theory-driven blocks.
The model is built in blocks (steps) with each block adding one or more predictors. The change in the model‚Äôs R-squared is assessed at every step. A series of multiple-regression are performed, with each block being added to the next until all variables are included in the model.
The final block of hierarchical multiple regression = simultaneous multiple regression. Very useful to look at the change in R-squared for each variable or blocks of variables Allow for testing hypotheses in the order of importance/priority of predictors. Squared semi-partial correlation provides the unique variance explained by a given variable. Predictors are added/removed from the model based on statistical criteria such as p-values or R-squared change rather than being theory-driven. Predictors are added/removed in data-driven blocks.
Mathematically derives the highest R-squared value with the least number of predictors.
CAUTION: NEVER USE THIS METHOD UNLESS STUDY IS ABSOLUTELY EXPLORATORY. Most predictive variables are added first Least predictive variables are removed first When you square the semi-partial correlation, it yields the proportion of the variance of y uniquely explained by x while controlling for all other predictors.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK. The relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (outcome) variables is linear.
How to Check Use Scatterplots to visualize relationships. Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot.
Click Simple Scatter. Click Define.
Move your dependent variable (outcome) to the Y-Axis. Move your independent variable (predictor) to the X-Axis.
If the scatterplot is approximately linear, the assumption is met. If not linear, apply transformation. Observations are independent of each other (no autocorrelation, where observations are NOT independent)
How to Check Use the Durbin-Watson test by clicking the option under Linear Regression: Statistics.
If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 ‚Äì 2.5, the assumption is met. <br>If data is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Autocorrelation" data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">autocorrelated</a>, use alternative models such as the generalized least squares (GLS) model. The residuals (errors) have constant variance across all levels of independent variable(s).
How to Check Plot residuals vs. predicted values and look for a random scatter.
In SPSS, request Linear Regression Plots. Move Y &gt; ZPRED. Move X &gt; ZRESID. If the scatterplots shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met.
If assumption is violated, you can transform the dependent variable, use standard errors, or apply weighted least squares (WLS). The residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
How to Check (For None or One Grouping Variable) Click Analyze &gt; Descriptives &gt; Explore
Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box.
Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected.
Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. Click Continue.
Click OK.
Check Shapiro-Wilk Test of Normality, Normal P-P Plot, Histogram, and Skewness/Kurtosis. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below .05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution. If the points are generally along the diagonal of the Normal P-P Plot, the assumption is met.
If the Histogram is approximately normal (distribution curve is bell-shaped), the assumption is met.
If Skewness and Kurtosis are between +2 and -2, the assumption is met. How far a case is from some point of reference <br>Identifies the distance of cases from the mean (s) of predictor (s). Extreme cases in multivariate space are found via a cut-off point (critical value of <a data-href="Chi-Square Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/chi-square-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chi-Square Test</a>) Measure the distance between an observed value and its predicted value that have all been converted to z-scores.

Typically flagged if value is over 1 Factor loadings help determine which variable is associated with which latent factor. For example, several likert-scale questions on a questionnaire observing psychological outcomes may load highly on a ‚Äòdepressive/depression‚Äô factor, showing they measure the same underlying construct. Higher values of factor loadings (e.g., &gt; .4 or .5) indicate that a variable is a strong indicator of that factor. Lower values suggest the variable is less relevant to that factor. EFA can allow us to group variables with higher factor loadings on the same factor, reducing the complexity of our data.

The eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by each factor. If using the eigenvalue cutoff of 1, the cutoff is greater than 1 because the retained factors explain more variance. This can be seen on the Scree plot where there is a point where the slope of the curve changes, which is usually the cutoff for the number of factors we would retain. Factors to the left of the cutoff are considered meaningful. This is why there are only 3 out of the original 12 factors that were extracted from the analysis. The first three factors account for more of the variance in the model.

Descriptive statistics describe the state of the data. It summarizes and describes the characteristics of a data set whereas inferential statistics infer information about the sample participants based on their data.

On request
Commercial datasets (unless you have access through a library, department, funding) Publicly available (i.e., de-identified)
Restricted access (i.e., request to use)
Unshareable (i.e., no sharing possible) All verifiable/reusable data possibly through anonymization
Aggregated/summarized/redacted version of the data
Publicly share some parts and restrict access to others
Restrict access, but share details of data held
Share only details about study, no sharing possible Many datasets have both public and restricted files.
Restricted data contains more data and a wider range of data values than are included in public use data. For most, the public-use files provide all the data they will need for most analyses, though some users may find that only the restricted files have the specific data they need. If you are not sure, first examine the public-use data. Outliers (unusually high or unusually low values) are top- or bottom-coded to prevent identification of unique schools, teachers, parents, and children without affecting overall data quality. <br>Some <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> variables are converted into categorical variables, and some categorical variables have their categories collapsed. <br>Category value labels are provided for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> variables that are converted into categorical variables. Variables with too few cases and/or a sparse distribution are suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2 and labelled 'suppressed' in the Electronic Codebook (ECB). The value -2 means that the data for this variable are suppressed to protect the respondent's confidentiality. Variables that provide a particularly identifying characteristic, such as a specific disability, or information that could be matched against external data sources to obtain a specific identifying characteristic, such as exact date of marriage or divorce, are also suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2. Will vary for different data, but for all, you will need to complete an application. Submit signed license document Primary researcher
Senior official at institution Submit signed and notarized affidavits of nondisclosure for all proposed users. Submit a signed security plan (must specify the exact locked location) where the data will be secured. You cannot transmit restricted-use data.
Maintain a data license file and ensure that all authorized users follow the agreed upon terms. Participate in unannounced security inspections to ensure compliance. Adhere to established publication rules. Submit all materials for disclosure review. Complete annual trainings online. Complete yearly reports of what work you have done. Start with a broad question. Think about who might collect that data (e.g., governments, other researchers, etc.) Want to stick close to a specific subfield or type of data? Look for recognized repositories in your field, large research projects, or publications that have data access statements. Likely need to combine several search strategies. Remember Some disciplines have more of a tradition of sharing

Searching by variable name is helpful when you are interested in a particular variable (e.g., spanking). Often, studies are organized into collections in each archive so a researcher can quickly identify groups of studies focused on a particular subarea. The organization of each archive varies, but most share several major features. Most archives allow you to perform basic descriptive analyses before the downloading a dataset. This is great because you can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in repsonses, for your purposes. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications.

Study usage reports Subject Matter Consider whether the subject is consistent with your problem definition and whether the data apply to the time/population of interest Methods Consider whether the data can be used with your preferred method of analysis or if you'll need ot learn a new skill. Measurement Determine whether the data capture the measures and constructs you are interested in with sufficient/adequate detail. Time You will save time on data collection and get access to larger scale data, but may spend more time on cleaning, modifying, getting documentation, etc. License/Copyright Is the data licensed? Does it restrict usage? Terms of Use Are the terms you need to meet to gain access to the data or other restrictions? Citations You will want to formally cite the data you use; data sets should have a persistent identifier to help cite the data, such as DOI. Documentation Look for good documentation on how the data was collected, for what purpose, how it was transformed. Credibility Is the data from a recognized lab, researcher, institution? Do the publications based on the data hold? Does the dataset contain the information you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?
Do the measures used match those you require?
Is the data set a proxy for the data you really need?
Does the dataset cover the population that is the subject of your research?
Does the dataset cover the geographical area that is the subject of your research?
Can data about the population that is the subject of your research be separated from unwanted data?
Are the data for the right time period or sufficiently up to date?
Are data available for all the variables you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?
Are the variables defined clearly? How reliable is the dataset?
How credible is the data source?
Is it clear what the source of the data is?
Do the credentials of the source of the data (author, institution, or organization sponsoring the data) suggest it is likely to be reliable?
Do the data have an associated copyright statement?
Do associated published documents exist?
Does the source contain contact details for obtaining further information about the data?
Is the method described clearly?
If sampling was used, what was the procedure and what were the associated sampling errors and response rates?
Who was responsible for collecting or recording the data?
(For surveys) Is a copy of the questionnaire or interview checklist included?
(For compiled data) Are you clear how the data were analyzed and compiled?
Are the data likely to contain measurement bias?
What was the original purpose for which the data were collected?
Who was the target The most important step is to read ALL the data documentation. Before assessing data, review codebooks and questionnaires What information was collected
For whom and when and where
What changes were made before archiving Codebooks also include other information (e.g., topics addressed, questions and measurements used, frequency of responses or values, how to use the data, etc.)
Like a regular book, some codebooks are better than others. If people code the variable in a certain way, is there potential for error? Would two researchers get the same outcomes if they chose to code the variable differently?

A simple scatterplot (with a regression line) showing the relationship between the covariate and the outcome variable can help verify this assumption. You can run the ANCOVA model by including an interaction term (groups x covariate). The interaction term should not be statistically significant. If it is statistically significant, then it means the slopes are different across groups, hence the violation of this assumption. UNIANOVA Dependent Variable BY Factor WITH Covar

The R2 is .439, indicating that approximately 43.9% of the variation in children WISC score can be explained by the predictors. <br><img alt="6. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/6.-analysis-of-covariance-(ancova)-3.png" target="_self">

The order matters! Each effects partials out the one before it. So, if you are looking at a, b, and a x b The first value is for a
The value for b is after controlling for a
a x b's value is after controlling for a and b. Best for specific theory where order matters I.e., partial out certain variables first. a accounts for b and vice versa. This is best when you don't have an interaction effect. Every value accounts for every other effect (main or interaction) If order matters, Type I. If order does not matter, and there is no interaction, Type II. If order does not matter, but there is an interaction, Type III. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glm-2/in-class-content/6.-analysis-of-covariance-(ancova).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/In-Class Content/6.

A moderator is a variable that affects the strength or direction of the relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y).
A mediator is a variable that explains the mechanisms or process through which an independent variable (x) affects a dependent variable (y). The purpose of the ‚Äòseed‚Äô option in a line of PROCESS syntax is to lock the random number generator. This ensures that the findings remain consistent across multiple runs of the analysis. Without specifying a ‚Äòseed‚Äô value, the random number generator would draw different values each time, leading to slightly different results. When a covariable absorbs variable from both the predictor and the error term, it can lead to: Sphericity is an assumption in repeated measures ANOVA that states the variance of the differences between all pairs of within-subject conditions (levels of the independent variable) should be equal. This means that if we have three time points (A, B, C), then the variance of (A ‚Äì B) ‚âà variance of (A ‚Äì C) ‚âà variance of (B ‚Äì C).
Sphericity is a special case of homogeneity of variance assumption and is specific to repeated measures designs.
Potential Consequences of Violating Sphericity Inflated <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> Rate (False Positives) Standard F-tests assume sphericity, so violating it increases the risk of finding a significant effect when none actually exists.
The p-values become too small, leading to incorrect conclusions. Reduced Statistical Power (False Negative) If sphericity is violated and not corrected, the test might be too conservative, making it harder to detect real effects (Type II Error: Failing to detect a true effect). Distorted F-ratios The denominator degrees of freedom in the F-test get inflated which makes the ANOVA test statistics biased. This impacts the accuracy of hypothesis testing. Long-Format Data

Repeated measures designs are an extension of the dependent group (paired samples) t-test.
Paired samples t-tests are used to compare means between paired, dependent, or matched groups. Collection of data on the same persons over time means responses are related to each other, across time. They are <a data-href="Dependent Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Observations</a> Differences from pre to post (e.g., time 1 to time 2)
Often the same respondents, repeatedly measured (not always, but not our focus) In comparison, independent-groups designs look at: Differences in means across groups (often manipulated in experimental designs)
Mean differences across existing groups Gender, school level, generation status (e.g., quasi-experimental designs) With repeated measures designs, the structure of the data becomes relevant. Data types Long Respondents have multiple rows of data corresponding to multiple measurement occasions Wide Respondents have one row of data
Multiple variables are used to represent multiple measurement occasions GLM for repeated measures (aka repeated measures ANOVA/MANOVA) Combination of both between-and within-subjects factors are referred to as 'mixed designs' Different people are assigned to different levels of the factor
Each case (person) is exposed/included to only one condition or level The same person tests all conditions (i.e., is exposed to all levels of the factor)
Repeated-measures designs are 'within-subjects' designs, where each subject forms a 'group' or factor Repeated measures ANOVA SST = SS (Explained) + SS (unexplained) We are trying to explain differences in teh repeated measures due to time (or whatever the within factor is)
We are removing/controlling variability due specifically to subjects. We need to characterize unexplained/residual variability carefully for repeated measures designs (i.e., through the subject x time interaction)
One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA One-Way Repeated measures ANOVA with A treatments/times and B persons includes three 'sum of squares' terms. <br><img alt="7.

Relatedly, homogeneity of covariance is equal variances and covariacnes across time. Sphericity is a tough assumption to meet, as we don't expect correlations between times 1, 3, and 5 to be necessarily the same. Mauchly's sphericity test in SPSS tests this assumption. We do NOT want this to be statistically significant. The distribution of the data will not be in line with an F-distribution
Loss of statistical power
Post-hoc tests become uninterpretable
If violated, what should we do? Use a more conservative f-test. SPSS gives you three options increasing in conservatism
Consider using MANOVA
Consider using multilevel modeling Based on estimates of sphericity (Epsilon; Œµ) Ranges from 0 - 1 with higher scores meaning greater homogeneity Huynh-Feldt Correction (least conservative) Œµ &gt; .75
Greenhouse-Geisser (more conservative) Œµ &lt; .75
Lower-bound (most conservative) Œµ &lt;. 75
If the results change depending on which correction used, it's a safer bet to use Greenhouse-Geisser regardless of Epsilon value (e.g., the cutoff somehow made a difference) or report both and acknowledge the difference. <br>Instead of time as treatment effect (univariate), MANOVA treats time as separate <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> s (multivariate)
Repeated measures analyses automatically include both, but if sphericity is violated, it might be better to just use MANOVA. Repeated Measures ANOVA Univariate DV
More rigid assumptions of sphericity
When sphericity holds, use RM ANOVA
You can look at contrasts and other post-hoc tests MANOVA Multivariate DVs
Less rigid assumptions of sphericity
A large violation of sphericity (Œµ &lt; .70) and sample sizes of 10 people larger than the number of groups (j + 1), use MANOVA. The power of MANOVA varies as a function of the correlation between the DVs. <br>Multilevel modeling approach (aka <a data-href="Hierarchical Linear Models" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/models/hierarchical-linear-models.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Linear Models</a>; General Linear Mixed-Effects Models)
Growth curve models Predicts individual differences in change over time Time is nested within each subject
Very flexible Allows for random effects and variability in measurement occasion. If the overall F for differences among treatments is statistically significant, further analysis is needed to evaluate where the significant differences are. The SPSS procedure contrasts that can be used to evaluate differences. If the repeated measure has k levels, a set of contrasts include (k - 1) comparisons
Options Polynomial contrasts (the default in SPSS, but rarely used in social sciences)
Repeated contrasts
Simple contrasts For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them. <br>Very similar to dummy coding in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a>, where we only know differences between the reference category and all other categories (not each other) Compare the mean of each level (except the last) with the mean of the subsequent level Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 2 &gt; Time 3 Useful if the responses are in a meaningful order (like time)
Equivalence (or justifiable inequivalence) of measurement is crucial Makes more sense when the levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to different amounts of treatment (rather than different types)
If there are k levels for the repeated-measures factor, then (k - 1) polynomials will be tested. Example
- Patients' responses to an anxiety drug administered over time

Select your ID variable and put it as the case group identification. You could also 'use case number' and have the ID variable be a fixed variable, but I find that more troublesome. You then have to include all items to be stacked in separate blocks based on what the variable will be. You must do this for every variable to be stacked. The dataset has 129 such variables, so you can see that this will take a long time. Most of the time, stacked data comes stacked so you don't need to do this. ‚Äú7.

Partial Œ∑2 = .574, indicating 57.4% of the variation in the scores is accounted for by the differences in the scores. When constructing our table, we have the Between Groups Line (the line for the test that we use for our final result).
We also have the Within Groups (error) line (the associated error line for whichever test we use).
But what about the between persons results and the total line? Below is the Test of Between Subjects Effects

Sometimes called a Within-Subjects Design
In a one-way repeated measures model, each subject responds to each level of the factor
In a balanced design Each subject responds to all J levels of the factor
Each of the n subjects has J scores do N = n x J
Unequal cells can only happen when subjects miss the administration of one or more levels of factor A A researcher tested whether 1-hour, biweekly yoga classes increased the fitness level of eight undergraduate studnets over a 4-month period (4 levels of within-subjects factors). Students were measured at the end of each month using a 10-point fitness measure (10 being most fit). ‚Äú7. Repeated Measures Designs-10.png‚Äù could not be found.

The test scores were compared over time. Thus, we have 3 levels in the within-subjects factor (Time). For each pair of levels, we can obtain a st of difference scores. The sphericity assumption states that these three sets of difference scores have equal variance. If the variance of the difference scores are statistically equal then the sphericity assumption has been met. The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA
The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA. <br>The violation causes the 'Usual' F-test to become too liberal (i.e., an increase in the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate). Therefore, determining whether sphericity has been violated is very important. <br>Luckily, if violations of sphericity do occur, corrections have been developed to produce a more valid critical F-value (i.e., reduce the increase in <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate) Like in Levene's HOV test, the null hypothesis is the variances of difference scores are equal.
Test NOT Significant (p &gt; .05) &gt; Assumption MET! Variances are the same. Test Significant (p &lt; .05) &gt; Assumption NOT met! Variances are different. Measure: Score - Tests the null hypothesis that the error covariance matrix of the orthonormalized transformed dependent variables is proportional to an identity matrix: a Design: Intercept. Within Subjects Design: CAP. Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicates that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, , œá2 (2) = 7.916, p = .019.

For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them.

Restricted and public-use
Direct (e.g., biomarker data) and indirect observations (e.g., self-report) Economics Study design and data collection already completed - saves time and money Access To international and cross-historical data would otherwise take years and millions of dollars to collect Quality Data collection process is informed by expertise and professionalism that may not be available to smaller research projects External Validity Studies funded by the government generally involve larger samples that are more representative of the target population. Statistical Power Over sampling of low prevalence groups allows for increased power and precision Breadth Datasets often contain many variables Using it is the hardest part
Study design and data collection already completed
Data may lack depth. The greater the breadth the harder it is to measure a construct in depth. Constructs may be defined by a single item or a subset of items that have reliability/validity concerns
Posthoc measurement models maybe unsuccessful Certain fields or departments may place less value on secondary data analysis
May require knowledge of survey statistics/methods which is not generally provided by basic graduate statistics courses.

A research question is a statement that identifies the phenomenon to be studied. For example, "Does preschool influence children's language skills?" Why are good research questions important and what makes them 'good?' Purpose
Relevance
Feasibility To produce a research question, you need to know the literature first. Find out what has been done and how you can contribute to the existing literature. I have a research question. If you do not have a research question, narrow down your topic. Review the literature
Is the question viable, original. feasible?
You have a research question! Narrow down on an area of interest
Within that area, try to answer a question that: Has either not been addressed before
Has been addressed before but that you could extend (i.e., new data-set, different approach, etc.)
Has been addressed but requires replication
Starts a new research area (NOT recommended) Read as much as you can on the topic
Read recent studies first, then read backwards
Read all relevant papers (or at least the influential ones)
Ideas on the research topic often come from reading
The more you read, the easier it will be to come up with research questions Reviewing the literature will allow you to understand whether your question has been answered/is valid.
By reading previous studies, you might get ideas on how to tweak your original research question into a new one. Whether you have or do not have a research question, it is crucial that you review the literature in the area first. Many leave the review as the last step, but this is dangerous. Not original
Not feasible Time constraint (e.g., not enough time)
Resources (e.g., lack of data)
Knowledge (e.g., do I know method X?) Too broadly defined research question
Not well justified
Not motivated by literature Start searching for a topic as early as possible
Once you narrow down a topic/area, look at the relevant literature (i.e., a literature review)
Once you have done the literature review (has it already been done? No, why not? Is it interesting/relevant?), then ask yourself: Is the question specific (not too broad)?
Is it feasible in the allotted time?
Do I have enough resources (data) to answer this question?
How about knowledge (methods)?
Is the research question falling within my area of research?
If the answer is yes to all the previous question, congratulations, you have a research question. Your time is your most important resource. Do not take a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances) Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic/data set
More efficient time use (e.g., read similar lit)
Looks good when others are evaluating your CV A good research question will Allow outsiders to see your intentions
Help you develop hypotheses (not always)
Contributes to existing knowledge Contribution does not have to be huge
Replication is a contribution
Filling a gap is not enough justification, why does this gap matter? Guide the design of your methods
Allow the target population to be identified
Identify the outcome variables and key predictors of those variables
Determine what type of study is needed (e.g., descriptive, correlational, experimental)
Identify background characteristics that might influence predictors and outcomes
Raise questions about how to best collect data
Influence the number of participants in the study Writing a good question is an iterative process What do you want to learn about?
Draft and redraft with increasing specificity using the guidelines listed above. Ask for feedback from colleagues (science is a collective effort).
Build on the work of others by conducting a systematic literature review. This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. Hook the reader in. Practice! Explain the larger context that this study will inform. Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. Flows directly from the earlier points in paragraph 1. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. State the basic aims, hypotheses, questions, and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths) Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph - could be theoretically, in terms of policy, filling holes, etc. Can be combined with paragraph 2 in some cases.

The main question of interest was the extent to which personality traits at the time of marriage predict marital satisfaction and marital commitment post marriage. The researcher wrote two papers. One focused on the prediction of marital satisfaction, and the other focused on the prediction of marital commitment. The design of the study was he same in each paper, with the exception of the change in outcomes. Piecemeal A researcher recruited newlyweds and planned annual assessments over a five years. Some measures were assessments over a five years. Some measures were common to each annual assessment, whereas others common to each annual assessment, whereas others were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote an article regarding the relation between divorce history an article regarding the relation between divorce history and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital satisfaction from those who did not experience the satisfaction from those who did not experience the transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The researcher decided to publish these as three separate researcher decided to publish these as three separate articles. Not Piecemeal Researcher B was interested in the relation between family process and adolescent adjustment. She conducted and published a study in which the main conducted and published a study in which the main objective was to identify specific family processes that objective was to identify specific family processes that mediated the relation between family structure and mediated the relation between family structure and adjustment. Later, she read a new study that proposed that two of the family processes that she studied had an interactive effect on adjustment. Although such an interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, in additional analyses she found that such an effect did occur in her sample, although in a slightly different than in the newly published article. She wrote a second article to address this issue. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the extent to which support for marriage from family and friends affects rating of relationship quality. He collected data from a large convenience sample. Although not planned, the sample contained about 60% of persons in their first marriages and 40% of persons in remarriages. The researcher prepared two papers that examined the question of interest. In the first paper, he used data from the first-marriage subjects, whereas in the second paper he used data from the remarried subjects. The variables assessed and reported in the two papers were the same. Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the links between family structure and child adjustment. The researcher administered a survey to high school students. She discovered that there were large numbers in two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families, but very few students were in the single divorced father and stepmother families as part of the survey, students in stepfamilies answered survey items regarding the parenting behaviors of their stepparents as well as of their parents. She wrote two papers. The first examined differences in adjustment in children from two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families (the groups with the largest sample sizes). To facilitate the interpretation of family structure effects, she decided to exclude the rather small number of students in the second paper, she explored whether children's adjustment was related to how they rated the parenting behaviors of their parents and stepparents. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in rates of divorce in first-marriages and remarriages in different countries. She obtained data from an international organization that contained information on a number of different countries and wrote two papers. The first addressed the divorce rates in these two kinds of couples in Canada, and the second dealt with the same issue in England. The same theoretical rationale and measures were used in both papers, although the results led to different conclusions. Piecemeal Focus on quality and not quantity of publications Replicate the study with a different sample, setting, or methodology. Do this if most of the past research you have read examines one type of sample, setting, or method. Examine the topic using a different design. If the study was a quasi- or non-experimental, conduct an experiment. Do this if causation has not been consistently established by past research, or it has not been consistently established with the population you are interested in. Examine how another variable might impact results Do this if you have research evidence to suggest that results may depend on another variable. Conduct a similar study with a different outcome or dependent variable. Do this if you find research evidence supporting the new associations you plan to examine. Being first is not always a sign of being a good scientist Many discoveries are wrong or over claimed. You do not show you are a great scientist by being the first to claim something. A large part of getting over being scooped is getting over yourself and realizing that science is bigger than any one of us. It also means you are doing something other people care about. If you are scooped, do not be discouraged. It is unlikely that any two researchers would address a question in the exact same way. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Title: The importance of stupidity in scientific research, Author: Schwartz, Martin A.; Journal: Journal of Cell Science, Volume: 121,
Issue: 11
Pages: 1771-1771

ISSN: 1477-9137, 0021-9533 Keywords: Read Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Henry Taube (who won the Novel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I did not know was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right answer or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. We don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid - that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity.' that kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô. The point of the exam isn‚Äôt to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it‚Äôs the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student‚Äôs weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student‚Äôs knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@schwartzimportancestupidityscientific2008.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Title: The Art of Data Science, Author: Peng, Roger D; Matsui, Elizabeth; Year: 2018 Keywords: In Progress The thinking begins before you even look at a dataset, and it's well worth devoting careful thought to your question. This point cannot be over-emphasized as many of the 'fatal' pitfalls of data analysis can be avoided by expending the mental energy to get your question right. There are six basic types of questions. Descriptive
Exploratory
Inferential
Predictive
Causal
Mechanistic Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. The type of question you are asking directly informs how you interpret your results. A descriptive question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. There is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the set of data that you are working with. An exploratory question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. These types of analyses are also called 'hypothesis-generating' analyses because rather than testing a hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question, you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. An inferential question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data. A predictive question would be one where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal. In other instances, even if your data are not from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer a causal question. A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a mechanistic question. By necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions. If a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering the inferential question. The type of question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis).
If this type of data set does not exist, then the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illness. Establish your expectations about the question
Gathering information about your question
Determining if your expectations match the information you gathered, and then refining your question (or expectations) if your expectations did not match the information you gathered. There are five key characteristics of a good question for a data analysis, which range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already been answered to the more abstract characteristic that each of the possible answers to the question should have a single interpretation and be meaningful. The question should be of interest to your audience, the identity of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with data.
You should also check that the question has not already been answered. With the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon to discover that your question of interest has been answered already.
The question should also stem from a plausible framework. If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end up with an answer that's difficult to interpret or have confidence in. Many questions are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible framework. The question, should also, of course, be answerable.
Specificity is also an important characteristic of a good question. Working towards specificity will refine your question and directly inform what steps to take when you start looking at data.
With this degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will either recommend or not recommend the specific action. Another aspect to consider when you‚Äôre developing your question is what will happen when you translate it into a data problem. Every question must be operationalized as a data analysis that leads to a result. Pausing to think through what the results of the data analysis would look like and how they might be interpreted is important as it can prevent you from wasting a lot of time embarking on an analysis whose result is not interpretable. The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question that uses inappropriate data. The problem with this question is that for a single possible answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations arises when at least one of the variables you use is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after. To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required to answer your question. A related problem that intergeres with interpretation of results is confounding. Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship between factors. A brief description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both your exposure of interest and your outcome of interest. As you refine your question, spend time identifying the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information about these potential confounders. Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a biased result. The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics above what exists in the general population. A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors, bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person might recall the past when responding to a survey. The best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the question with the data available to you. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@pengartdatascience2018.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Secondary data analysis of large longitudinal and national data sets is a standard method used in many social sciences to answer complex questions regarding behavior. In this article, we detail the advantages of using these data sets to study developmental questions across the life span. First, we provide an overview of how using secondary data can increase studies‚Äô scientiÔ¨Åc integrity. Then, we detail where and how data sets can be obtained that answer speciÔ¨Åc questions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues related to using longitudinal, population data sets. These data sets can enhance science and test theories by increasing the rigor and generalizability of research to the general population, making secondary data analysis an important method to consider.
Keywords: Need to Read Primary data are collected by an individual or a team of researchers and are often based on the theory or models of the researcher or research team. These data are also generally proprietary and not shared with the larger research community. In contrast, secondary data analysis uses data collected by other researchers or organizations, and the users are generally not part of the design of the study. These data sets (e.g., most national studies) have been collected for the use of the research community or have been made available for other researchers to use (e.g., in data archives). These data sets were collected based on the research theories and models of the primary researchers and include extensive measurements on the areas of interest to the research team. Although some data sets remain proprietary to the original researcher or research team, new regulations on data sharing from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are increasing the amount of data available for secondary data analysis. Many secondary data sets contain similarities in measurement that allow many data sets to be combined using techniques such as integrative data analysis, a technique that is especially useful for data sets that represent highly selective groups (e.g., children of alcoholics) that would be difficult to find in a general population sample. Combining the data sets increases the sample size and thus the power to examine these groups. Using secondary data sets, especially those collected at the population level, increases statistical power and external validity as a result of a larger sample size and greater diversity of respondents (with regard to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). This advantage, combined with reducing the time and money it takes to collect one's own longitudinal data, makes secondary data analysis a good option.
These data resources are easy to obtain. In the US, the two largest social science data archives are the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Murray Research Archive.<br>
<img alt="Social Science Secondary Data Archives Table.jpeg" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/social-science-secondary-data-archives-table.jpeg" target="_self">
ICPSR requires affiliation with a member institution. Some data sets are available for immediate download while others require an application explaining the scientific purpose for data use. Data are generally free though fees may apply for digitization of not-yet digital materials or other labor-intensive data-preparation tasks. Archives are easily searchable, including the ability to search by study topic or variable name. Searching by study topic is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching by variable name is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching for variable name is helpful when the researcher is interested in a particular variable, such as rates of endorsement or forms of measurement of a variable across studies. Most archives allow researchers to perform basic descriptive analyses online before downloading a data set, including frequency counts for each variable and tabular analysis. Scientists can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in responses, or not too much missing data for the new study. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. The most important step is to read all the data documentation - text documents posted in the data archive alongside the data. Understanding and properly accounting for the sampling frame and necessary weights are crucial in producing accurate results, and the study documentation contains the necessary information. Secondary data rarely have all the measures to answer investigators' questions. Using data that have been collected by others typically means that measures for some of the constructs germane to the research question will be missing. Because population data sets typically measure a broad set of constructs with limited measurement on any given construct, they often are not ideal for answering nuanced questions that require in-depth measurement. Once a researcher has addressed the issue of obtaining the data set or sets to address his or her research questions and whether they adequately answer the relevant research questions, additional statistical issues must be considered in analyzing this data. Because oversampling of one or more subpopulations is common in population-based studies, researchers often must apply a same weight if they want their findings to generalize to the target population. Subpopulations that are underrepresented in the sample relative to the target population have sample weights larger than 1.0, while the opposite holds for subpopulations overrepresented in the sample relative to the target population. When no sample weights are applied, it is as if a sample weight of 1.0 is uniformly applied to all subpopulations. In effect, this assumes all subpopulations are represented accurately within the sample, leading to biased estimates when this assumption does not hold. Typically, the appropriate set of sample weights and its corresponding variable name are identified clearly within a data set's documentation files. <br>In contrast to sample weights, which adjust for <a data-href="Sampling Bias" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/sampling-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sampling Bias</a>, attrition weights correct for bias introduced by attrition. The objective of attrition weights is to render the Wave 2 sample comparable to the full Wave 1 sample. Mathematically, attrition weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition or dropping out: P (Wave 1) / (Wave 2) Combination weights (also called longitudinal weights) adjust for both sampling bias and attrition bias. Mathematically, combination weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., the sample weight) multiplied by the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition (i.e., the attrition weight): [P (target population) / P (sample)] x [P (Wave 1) / P (Wave 2)].
We suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights (either alone or as a part of combination weights) and instead of using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), or multiple imputation (MI) to adjust for attrition bias and then use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias. We make this recommendation because relative to FIML and MI, attrition weights (including combination weights) have two disadvantages: Unlike FIML and MI, attrition weights often sharply reduce the analytical sample size and, thereby, statistical power. Typically, only those participants with data at every wave are assigned an attrition weight and used in subsequent analyses. This problem is compounded as a study's number of waves (and therefore attrition) increases. Second, if many auxiliary variables (i.e., non-model variables related to missing data) are incorporated, FIML and MI may adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights. Most statistical packages can use FIML, including STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS, and AMOS, and many use MI (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS). Most large-scale data sets were collected using complex sample designs that entail a clustered sampling design (e.g., schools are randomly sampled and then all students within the selected schools are sampled). <br>Because a clustered sampling design reduces variance (e.g., 100 students from the same school are likely more similar to one another demographically than are 100 students from 100 different schools), it also reduces standard errors and thereby inflates the change for <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. To adjust for these design effects, a primary sampling unit variable (e.g., schools) and potentially a stratification variable are incorporated into analyses. Most statistical packages (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS) can adjust for a complex sampling design and typically the appropriate primary sampling unit and, if necessary, stratification variables are clearly identified within a data set's documentation files. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@davis-keanansweringdevelopmentalquestions2015.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

The family's holistic quality represents the unique entity created by the combination of individual members. The parts of a system work together to create something new and distinct. (Think of a cake. When the individual ingredients are combined, they create something totally new. Each ingredient plays a unique part in the quality of the cake as they interact). In family systems, these new systems-level properties or behaviors emerge as a result of the transactions of the parts and are known as emergent properties rather than purely summative qualities Family systems are comprised of interdependent parts. When one part of the system changes, all parts will be affected. Reverberations can be felt throughout the system. Family systems are self-reflexive and self-regulating. Systems are cybernetic and utilize feedback to maintain themselves and to achieve goals. While early family systems theorists focused on families' inclinations toward homeostasis or change resistance, contemporary theorists also note adaptive changes made possible as a result of family self-regulation. Communication in human systems facilitated the family's ability to create meaning, monitor behavior and attain goals, and modify plans and future goal-directed activities based on feedback. Individual and family behavior must be understood in context. Family systems have boundaries that demarcate families from their environments, indicating who is in and out of the family system. A family receives input or 'energy, matter, and information' from its environment returns output to the environment. This interchange of inputs and outputs generates change for both the family and the environment in which it is nested. One central means through which Americans seek to fulfill their needs is through their marriage, especially as their access to nonspousal significant others has declined. Since the nation's founding, the extend to which Americans look to their marriage to help them fulfill their lower needs has decreased, whereas the extent to which they look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs has increased. Just as the pursuit of higher needs frequently requires substantial insight into the self, looking to the marriage to help individuals fulfill their higher needs frequently requires that each spouse have substantial insight into the partner, and the development of such insight typically requires considerable communication and responsiveness over a sustained period.
Even as Americans increasingly look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs, they have, on average, reduced their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage. In conjunction, the resource imbalance resulting from the trends described in tenets 2, 3 and 4 - insufficient investment to meet the emphasis on higher needs - has undermined spouses' marital quality and personal well-being (although those spouses who manage to invest sufficient resources experience especially strong marital quality and personal well-being). Spouses experiencing the adverse effects described in Tenet 5 have 3 general options for ameliorating or reversing these consequences: optimizing their usage of the resources that are available, increasing their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage, and asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating their higher needs.

The human being who is missing everything in life in an extreme fashion is most likely motivated to meet his physiological needs first, before turning his energy and attention to others needs. Safety Needs A human being requires a sense of safety in society wherein he feels protected. Love Needs Love, affection, and sense of belongingness in order to feel complete. A human being requires a family, friends, and sense of belonging in order to feel complete. Esteem Needs Human beings have a need or desire for self-respect and self-esteem, or a high evaluation of themselves. Human beings are motivated by the need to avhieve and the desire for freedom, independence, strength, mastery, and confidence in the face of the world. Human kind is also motivated by the need to be respected by other people, by a desire for reputation or prestige, recognition, attention, importance, and appreciation. Satisfying the self-esteem need leads to feelings of self-confidence and self-worth, while thwarting these needs produces feelings of inferiority and helplessness. Self-Actualization Need Self-actualization is a desire for self-fulfillment, a desire to be all that a person can potentially be. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/midterm.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Theoretical Perspectives on the Family (HDFS 8820)/Midterm.canvas</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:58:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.

Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people. Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. People are always communicating. All behavior is communicative. One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions Report = Content = information = (What is said)
Command = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life
BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.
Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions Go slow
Engage in behavior they want to eliminate What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. <br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. <br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop.

Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it.

This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. What often needs to happen?

Structural: Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies. Functional: Problems result when people try to protect or control one another covertly, so that their symptoms serve a function for the system. Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. The job is simply to get the family moving again.
Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. In pushing family members to set concrete goals, they are forced to clarify vague dissatisfactions. The primary goal is behavior change. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. <br><a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. <br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around) Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. Define a resolvable complaint. Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. Who sees it as a problem?
Why is it a problem now? "What is the problem that brings you here today?" is too vague. Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. The solution is part of the problem.
Prescribe some alternative behavior!
The key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. MRI Approach: Introduction to the treatment setup
Inquiry and definition of the problem
Estimation of the behavior maintaining the problem
Setting goals for treatment
Selecting and making behavioral interventions
Termination Attempted solutions: The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories: When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT
When clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING
When clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. Paradoxical interventions: The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s). Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. Restraining technique: Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different. Co-founded the Family Therapy Institute of Washington D.C. (1974)

Emphasize short term treatment (10 sessions) Define a problem clearly
Investigating all solutions that have previously been tried
Defining a clear and concrete change to be achieved
Formulating and implementing a strategy for change Therapists must be innovative
Therapy must be customizable to families (technique driven)
If families are going to change, alterations in ways their members act must precede new perceptions or feelings
Focus on interpersonal payoff of psychiatric symptoms Social Stage: Introduction and setup
Help everyone relax, greet each family member, make sure everyone is comfortable. Problem Stage: Definition of the problem in clear behavioral terms
Ask each individual for their perspective, speak to the less involved parent/partner first to get their involvement, listen carefully to the way each family member describes the problem, make sure no one interrupts until each has a turn, make observations. Emphasize the use of directives.
If therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. Interaction Stage: Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem
Encourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another? Goal Setting Stage Providing directives
Give the family a task, directives Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. "The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation." For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: "Who makes you depressed?"
"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. Example: A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent. Mandanes talked about how one relationship may metaphorically replicate another and power struggles in couples (money, education, control of children, etc.) Negotiation (pg. 90)

Pretend techniques (pg. 91)
Ordeals (pg. 91) Hayley believed that telling people what they're doing wrong only mobilizes resistance. Changes in behavior alter perceptions. Milan group was interested in getting families to see things differently through (reframe) positive connotation. Which then gets family members to behave differently. Shift from behavior to cognition set stage for constructivist/narrative movements. Families should have clear generational boundaries. Therapists should be 'neutral' and not have expectations for families. Therapy helps the family by simply examining the family, asking questions to help them examine their own family structure, and exposing games after which they can redesign their family into a better structure on their own. <br><a data-href="Mara Selvini Palazzoli" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/mara-selvini-palazzoli.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mara Selvini Palazzoli</a>

Session: Validate, modify, and change the hypothesis. Intersession: Team discussion of hypothesis and arrival at an intervention. Intervention: Delivery of the intervention to the family.

Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. Set minimum goals for change. Investigate solutions to the complaints. Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'
Understand clients' preferred views. Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'
Nurture and solidify initial change. Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)
Therapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)
Co-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)
Late in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?
I don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. Define a resolvable complaint. Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint Who is doing what?
If I had a video of this, what would I see? Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?
Determine a minimum change goal What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem: What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?
What happens after these attempted solutions? Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like: What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution? The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions: How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?
What do they hold near and dear?
When are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?
What is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?
Whose idea was it to come? Why now?
Who is most optimistic that therapy will help? How will you know the situation is improving?
What kinds of change will you settle for?
What will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?
What will each of you settle for? Therapeutic restraint: Telling clients to 'go slow'
Cautioning them about the dangers of improvement
Giving insturctions about how to make the problem worse Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. Identify problem-solution feedback loops: Demand-Refuse
Discuss-Acoid
Criticize-Defend
Accuse-Deny Encourage the family to do less of the same: When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. <br><a data-href="Reframing" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reframing</a>: For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. Acknowledging (Reinforcing): When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. Predicting or Prescribing: Exploring the dangers of movement. Therapeutic restraint / going slow
Prescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting
Jamming / experiment
Reframing
Less of the same
Acknowledge / reinforce Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on: Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing. Applicable to any family that presents with a clear complaint. Particularly relevant for families that seem resistance to change. Most qualitative research (case reports) and follow-up quantitative data. Historically, most of the research on the effectiveness of Strategic Therapy wasn't very rigorous. Mostly case report format.

What are the biggest challenges social scientists face when trying capture meaning in the real world? What strategies are helpful to overcoming these strategies?
What is one construct that you are interested in capturing in your research? Thoroughly describe 3 different ways you could capture it in a study (Be creative!!!). How will you determine if your measurement strategy is 1) valid and 2) appropriate for the population you are studying? Why do researchers HARK and/or use their flexibility in their publications? Significant findings get published
Desire to tell a good story
Hindsight bias
Need for speed How do we as a field reduce HARKing and problematic use of flexible decisions? Demand transparency
Change incentive structures
Use of pre-registration to: Force less flexibility after the data is collected
Allow reviewers to see a priori decisions Encourage replication
Encourage/mandate data sharing Ensuring appropriate use of your findings How can researchers ensure that there is appropriate use of their findings? Discussion sections
Engaging with media
Not overstating relevance of findings to practice and policy - especially if exploratory work (e.g., not pre-registered, no replications) Our desire to advocate can cause ethical challenges. Harm to particpants (e.g., zone of privacy)
Ways that we present findings and interpret findings Something to always be aware of and thinking about when making decisions. Discuss early and often

Want valid results Validity is how we think through likely accuracy of our research
Measurement validity=closeness to the truth; are we capturing the concepts we seek to capture? How do you decide what measures to capture in a study? Start with your research question. Conceptualization: What are the concepts we are interested in?
How do we define them?
How do we define them in ways that are measurable? Specific
Able to be captured Need to do for both objective (e.g., income) and abstract (e.g. happiness) Operationalization: The process of developing valid measurement of the variables in a study
E.g., choosing measures for survey developing observation protocols, developing experimental manipulations Independent Variable Predictor Dependent Variable Outcome Control Variable (Covariate) We think they matter for both the predictor and outcome. We want to make sure the associations we are looking at are not just Moderating Variable (Changes the association you are looking at)
Mediating Variable (Process)
Need to conceptualize and operationalize all of these variables in advance. Goal is to use measures that are reliable and valid Look to theory for help with conceptualization Look to prior empirical research for help with measure selection When possible, choose measures for which reliability and validity has already been established. However, you will still need to demonstrate this within the sample you collect/use. Measures cannot be valid if they are not reliable. Reliability: Degree to which a measure produces a consistent answer when the phenomenon being studied is not changing Test-Retest
Internal Consistency
Interrater Reliability
You should be prepared to report on internal consistency and interrater reliability within your own research. Reliability lets you know if you are capturing something meaningful, but not if it is what you are intending to capture.

Lorenz and the multitrait model
Think about Venn dyagrams and where shared and unique variance comes from Just because a measure works for one group of people does not mean it will work for another. Huge problem in our field.

Internal Consistency
Interrater Reliability
You should be prepared to report on internal consistency and interrater reliability within your own research. Reliability lets you know if you are capturing something meaningful, but not if it is what you are intending to capture. Face Validity Does a test measure what it's supposed to measure? Content Validity Assess whether a test is representative of all aspects of the construct Criterion Validity Evaluates how accurately a test measures the outcome it was designed to measure Discriminant Validity Measures whether constructs that theoretically should not be related to each other are, in fact, unrelated. The measures we choose will eventually become the variables in our statistical analyses

Check for normality
Check for unusual data (e.g., bots)
Check for outliers Have plan ready in advance Look at reliability statistics
Look at associations among independent variables Is a latent variable warranted?

Highlight the unique contributions of your work Although you may not review every related study, you need to do a thorough literature review to understand how your study relates to others and how your study fits. Focus on peer-reviewed journal articles
Try to get a sense of paper by looking at abstract and skimming before committing to fully reading To do this more effectively, you should plan out the sections of your literature review in advance Based on your questions
Provide an organization/headings for your literature review
Your questions may be a series of questions (each will become a header in your literature review/introduction)
Or your questions may build upon each other Your sequential logic becomes the headers for your introduction
And it ensures that you know the 'argument' for each section (because you have the arrows drawn and connections made already) Note: your argument does not mean you ignore findings that don't support your hypothesis - you use them as arguments as to why your research is needed. Ultimately, should match your first 2/3 paragraphs, methods, results, and discussion. Keep your headings general and big picture
Consider ending with a, 'The present study...' section
May have to include a conceptual or theoretical paragraph somewhere Often easier to discuss theory within your aims-based headings Try not to use jargon, simple words instead
Do not repeat yourself even if it is written in a different way (e.g., put another way)
Do not provide laundry list of extant literature; instead, synthesize What is it? Is it attainable?
Think about research you have read recently? Do you think they have adequately discussed generalizability?
Big takeaways: Being as thoughtful as possible about our sampling plan before collecting data is going to help us create higher quality research. Be transparent about the ways in which your research is or is not generalizable. Getting good samples is really hard. Your research doesn't have to be perfect (remember no study is). Sample Generalizability: Can findings based on a sample be applied to the larger population from which the sample was drawn?
Need for 'thick description' Cross-Population Generalizability Can findings from a study of one population be applied ot other populations?
Usually infers in universality (although doesn't have to) Sampling is unnecessary if all the units in the population are identical (e.g., blood)
But what about people? Are fundamental psychological processes the same across all people (universal)? When random sampling is not possible
Availability (Convenience) Sampling: Take who you can get
Exploratory or qualitative research
Intro to psych! It is okay to use convenience sampling but you need to be aware of and acknowledging your limitations. Quota Sampling: Make sure sample represents certain characteristics in the population (but can't know all characteristics, and not random)
This is not as good as random/probability sampling but is still a much improved strategy over convenience sampling. Purposive Sampling: Studying a subset of limited group
Studying 'key informants'
High on internal validity Population: The entire set of individuals or other entities (e.g., families, schools) to which study findings are to be generalized
Census = study the whole population Sampling Frame A list of all the elements in a population Sample A subset of a population used to study the population as a whole Two factors that make it easier to get a representative sample: Larger samples are more likely to be representative Sample size does matter in quantitative research
Both for generalizability and power
However, unthoughtful sampling doesn't improve much with larger samples. It is easier to derive a representative sample from a homogenous population (i.e., can have a smaller sample) Allows us to know in advance how likely it is that any element of a population will be selected. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-methods/lecture/5.-generalizability,-sampling,-and-power.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Research Methods/Lecture/5.

A key purpose of theorizing in family science is to develop explanations of family phenomena. There are other purposes for which theory might be constructed (Klein &amp; White, 1996; Schneider, 2006; Swedberg, 2014), but in this chapter, I will discuss theory for the purpose of explanation (Bengtson et&nbsp; al., 2005a; Fine &amp; Fincham, 2013a). Theories are created by theorizing, and theorizing is thus any process by which a researcher develops explanations. While theorizing is about understanding the world, metatheorizing is about understanding theorizing. One may distinguish three different kinds of metatheorizing (Ritzer, 1988): ‚Ä¢ Metatheorizing to summarize, interpret, and/or critique (the contents of) prior theory. ‚Ä¢ Metatheorizing to propose rules for effective theorizing. This includes textbooks on theorizing (D.&nbsp;C. Bell, 2009; Chafetz, 1978; Hage, 1972; Swedberg, 2014). ‚Ä¢ Metatheorizing to describe and evaluate methods of theorizing, largely conducted by philosophers (e.g., Godfrey-Smith, 2003; Hempel, 1965; Popper, 1965; Staley, 2014). This chapter will emphasize the third type of metatheorizing, a discussion which will naturally touch to some extent on metatheorizing of the second type.

This article addresses the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), family processes, and human development. The topic is framed as part of the general issue of health disparities, which involves the oft-observed positive relationship between SES and the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical well-being of adults and children. A review of recent research and theory identiÔ¨Åes three general theoretical approaches that provide possible explanations for the association between SES and individual development: the social causation, social selection, and interactionist perspectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates support for the social causation view that SES affects families and the development of children in terms of both family stress processes (the family stress model) and family investments in children (the family investment model). However, there also is empirical support for the social selection argument that individual characteristics lead to differences in SES. Especially important, recent research is consistent with an interactionist approach, which proposes a dynamic relationship between SES and developmental change over time. Drawing on the combined set of research Ô¨Åndings, the article concludes with the description of an interactionist model that serves as a heuristic for future studies of the links among SES, parenting behaviors, and child development.

Title: Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research: A Focus on Validity and Change, Editor: Miller, Richard B.; Johnson, Lee N.; Publisher: Routledge,
Location: New York,
Year: 2014 ISBN: 978-0-203-08452-6
Research is vital in moving the field of family therapy forward, but the myriad of possibilities inherent in working with systems and individuals can overwhelm even the most seasoned researcher. Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research is the best resource to address the day-to-day questions that researchers have as they investigate couples and families, and the best source for learning long-term theory and methodology. The contributors of this volume share their wisdom on a wide variety of topics including validity concerns, measuring interpersonal process and relational change, dyadic data analysis (demonstrated through a sample research study), mixed methods studies, and recruitment and retention. The volume contains one of the most detailed descriptions of data collections and covers interviewing, using questionnaires, and observing brain activity.&nbsp; Also addressed are suggestions to meaningfully reduce cultural bias, to conduct ethical research, and, in the Health Services Research chapter, to examine interventions for clients in various income brackets. A separate, ground-breaking chapter also addresses psychophysiological research in a couple and family therapeutic context. As an added benefit, readers will learn how to become informed consumers of journal articles and studies, how to produce quality, publishable research, and how to write fundable grant proposals. Each chapter provides a clear and detailed guide for students, researchers, and professionals, and as a whole Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research advances the field by teaching readers how to provide evidence that marriage and family therapy not only relieves symptoms, but also effects behavioral change in all family members. Few studies have included information about how other members of the system change in relation to a single individual. The more traditional forms of statstical methods do not allow for multiple members of the same system to be included in the same analysis. The more traditional methods of statistical analysis often used in clinical trials research (repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple regression 5924 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:Lps.2008@live.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" target="_self">Lps.2008@live.com</a>

Type: Journal Article
Title: Romantic Love Conceptualized as an Attachment Process, Author: Kazan, Cindy; Shaver, Phillip; This article explores the possibility that romantic love is an attachment process‚Äîa biosocial process by which affectional bonds are formed between adult lovers, just as affectional bonds are formed earlier in life between human infants and their parents. Key components of attachment theory, developed by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and others to explain the development of affectional bonds in infancy, were translated into terms appropriate to adult romantic love. The translation centered on the three major styles of attachment in infancy‚Äîsecure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent‚Äîand on the notion that continuity of relationship style is due in part to mental models (Bowlby's "inner working models") of self and social life. These models, and hence a person's attachment style, are seen as determined in part by childhood relationships with parents. Two questionnaire studies indicated that (a) relative prevalence of the three attachment styles is roughly the same in adulthood as in infancy, (b) the three kinds of adults differ predictably in the way they experience romantic love, and (c) attachment style is related in theoretically meaningful ways to mental models of self and social relationships and to relationship experiences with parents. Implications for theories of romantic love are discussed, as are measurement problems and other issues related to future tests of the attachment perspective.
Keywords: Bowlby's major purpose was to describe how infants become emotionally attached to their primary caregivers and emotionally distressed when separated from them, although he also contended that 'attachment behavior [characterizes] human beings from the cradle to the grave.'
The purpose of this article is to explore the possibility that Attachment Theory, designed primarily with infants in mind, offers a valuable perspective on adult romantic love. For our purpose, which is to create a coherent framework for understanding love, loneliness, and grief at different points in the life cycle. Love appears to take multiple forms. They have not said how the healthy and unhealthy forms git together in a single conceptual framework. <a data-href="Attachment Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/attachment-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attachment Theory</a> not only provides such a framework, but it also explains how both healthy and unhealthy forms of love originate as reasonable adaptations to specific social circumstances. Attachment theory deals with separation and loss and helps explain how loneliness and love are related. Attachment theory links adult love with socioemotional processes evident in children and nonhuman primates; it places love within an evolutionary context. When a human or primate infant is separated from its mother, the infant goes through a predictable series of emotional reactions. The first is protest, which involves crying, active searching, and resistance to others' soothing efforts. The second is despair, which is a state of passivity and obvious sadness. The third, discussed only with reference to humans, is detachment, an active, seemingly defensive disregard for and avoidance of the mother if she returns. The attachment system, as Bowlby called the complex constellation of attachment feelings and behaviors seems have evolved to protect infants from danger by keeping them close to the mother. When very young, a human infant can do little more than cry, make eye context, smile, and snuggle in to encourage its mother to keep it near. Once mobile, however, it can actively pursue its mother and vocalize to her. When an infant is healthy, alert, unafraid, and in the presence of its mother, it seems interested in exploring and mastering the environment and in establishing affiliative contact with other family and community members. Researchers call this using the mother as a secure base. Attachment theory can be summarized in three propositions: The first [proposition] is that when an individual is confident that an attachment figure will be available to him whenever he desires it, that person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will an individual who for any reason has no such confidence in the availability of attachment figures, or lack of it, is built up slowly during the years of immaturity - infancy, childhood, and adolescence - and that whatever expectations are developed during those years tend to persist relatively unchanged throughout the rest of life. The third proposition concerns the role of actual experience. It postulates that the varied expectations of the accessibility and responsiveness of attachment figures that individuals develop during the years of immaturity are tolerably accurate reflections of the experiences those individuals have actually had. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 235) Ainsworth's research suggested a mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her infant's signals and needs during the first year of life are important prerequisites. Mothers who are slow or inconsistent in responding to their infant's cries or who regularly intrude on or interfere with their infant's desired activities (sometimes to force affection on the infant at a particular moment) produce infants who cry more than usual, explore less than usual (even in the mother's presence), mingle attachment behaviors with overt expressions of anger, and seem generally anxious. If, instead, the mother consistently rebuffs or rejects the infant's attempts to establish physical contact, the infant may learn to avoid her. Delineated three styles or types of attachment, often called secure, anxious/ambivalent, and avoidant. Infants in the anxious/ambivalent category frequently exhibit the behaviors Bowlby called protest, and the avoidant infants frequently exhibit the behaviors he called detachment. According to Bowlby, working models (which we will also call mental models) and the behavior patterns influenced by them are central components of personality. The claim of cross-situational and cross-age continuity is still controversial but is supported by a growing list of longitudinal studies from infancy through the early elementary school years. Continuity, according to Bowlby (1973), is due primarily to the persistence of interrelated mental models of self and social life in the context of a fairly stable family setting: "Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: Whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection
Whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming." (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238) No one has attempted to conceptualized the entire range of romantic love experiences in a way that parallels the typology developed by Ainsworth and her colleagues. Nor has anyone with an interest in romantic relationships pursued Bowlby's idea that continuity in relationship style is a matter of mental models of self and social life. Finally, no one has explored the possibility that the specific characteristics of parent-child relationships identified by Ainsworth et al., as the probable causes of differences in infant attachment styles are also among the determinants of adults' romantic attachment styles. We expected roughly 60% of adults to classify themselves as secure and the remainder to split fairly evenly between the two insecure types, with perhaps a few more in the avoidant than in the anxious/ambivalent category. In a summary of American studies of three types of infants Campos et al., (1983) concluded that 62% are secure, 23% avoidant, and 15% are anxious/ambivalent. We predicted that the most important love experience of a secure adult would be characterized by trust, friendship, and positive emotions. For avoidant adults, love was expected to be marked by fear of closeness and lack of trust. Anxious/ambivalent adults were expected to experience love as a preoccupying, almost painfully exciting struggle to merge with another person. This last style is similar to what Hindy and Schwarz (1984) called anxious romantic attachment and Tennov (1979) called limerence. Respondents' working models of self and relationships were also expected to differ according to attachment style. Secure types should believe in enduring love, generally find others trustworthy, and have confidence that the self is likable. Avoidant types should be more doubtful of the existence or durability of romantic love and believe that they do not need a love partner in order to be happy. Anxious/ambivalent types should fall in love frequently and easily but have difficulty finding true love. They should also have more serf-doubts than the other two types because, unlike avoidant respondents, they do not repress or attempt to hide feelings of insecurity. We expected respondents of the three types to report different attachment histories. According to the theory, Secure respondents should remember their mothers as dependably responsive and caring
Avoidant respondents should report that their mothers were generally cold and rejecting
Anxious/ ambivalent respondents should remember a mixture of positive and negative experiences with their mothers. Because the attachment needs of insecure respondents are unlikely to be fully met, avoidant

Title: A 20‚ÄêYear Review of Common Factors Research in Marriage and Family Therapy: A Mixed Methods Content Analysis, Author: D'Aniello, Carissa; Fife, Stephen T.; Journal: Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, Volume: 46,

Introduced by Sprenkle, Blow &amp; Dickey (1999), common factors in marriage and family therapy (MFT) have been discussed over the past two decades. Although the MFT common factors literature has grown, there are misconceptions and disagreements about their role in theory, practice, research, and training. This content analysis examined the contributions of the common factors paradigm to MFT theory, practice, research, and training over the past 20&nbsp;years. We identified 37 scholarly works including peer‚Äêreviewed journal articles, books, and chapters. Using mixed methods content analysis, we analyze and synthesize the contributions of this literature in terms of theoretical development about therapeutic effectiveness in MFT, MFT training, research, and practice. We provide commentary on the substantive contributions that the common factors paradigm has made to these areas, and we discuss the implications and limitations of the common factors literature, and provide recommendations for moving common factors research forward.
Keywords: Need to Read Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), long considered the gold standard for testing the effectiveness of treatment approaches and interventions, rest on the assumption that models and interventions are responsible for change. <a data-href="Common Factors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/common-factors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Common Factors</a> are defined as the general mechanisms of change that cut across models, rather than aspects of treatment that are unique to a particular model. Common factors, rather than model-specific factors, are largely responsible for effective therapy. Despite increased theoretical and empirical support for common factors, there has been continued debate about their usefulness in the MFT field. The purpose of this content analysis is to critically analyze, synthesize, and clarify the contributions of the common factors paradigm to MFT theory, research, training, and practice. <br><a data-href="Common Factors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/common-factors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Common Factors</a> are an umbrella term for the general mechanisms or variables associated with therapeutic change that are common across therapy models. Common factors, also called general factors or mechanisms of change, are factors that contribute to change in psychotherapy. They are not the province of a specific model but instead are found in all therapies. Common factors are further defined as broad and narrow. Broad common factors include general aspects of treatment such as client and therapist factors, extra-therapeutic variables (e.g., foruitous events, social support), therapist-client relationship factors, and the client's expectancy of the success of therapy. Empirical support for common factors is grounded in outcome studies and meta-analyses of therapeutic effectiveness. Narrow common factors refer to aspects of treatment found in several models that go by different names. <br>Different models of therapy share common processes or goals, otherwise defined as <a data-href="Model-Dependent Common Factors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Model-Dependent Common Factors</a>. These include shifting each partner's cognition, affect, or behavior; reattribution; reinforcement; desensitization; and psychoeducation and skills training. What are some examples of common factors in your own work with the various theories? How often do they overlap? The MFT field has traditionally conceptualized and explained therapeutic effectiveness through the lens of models. Therapy is effective because of the unique and particular philosophy or intervention of each therapeutic model. However, several meta-analyses of psychotherapy demonstrate this is not the care, finding no model of couple and family therapy consistently yielding better results than others. It is important to critically examine the impact, strengths, and limitations of this paradigm as applied to MFT theory and practice. What are the primary characteristics of common factors literature in the MFT field? What common factors are identified in the MFT literature?
How do common factors researchers draw distinctions between change mechanisms, change process, and common factors?
How do common factors contribute to the discussion about the therapeutic effectiveness of MFT?
How do MFT scholars explain the relationship between common factors and models?
How do common factors inform and enhance MFT practice, research, and training? How does the MFT common factors literature answer fundamental questions about therapeutic effectiveness and the process of change in therapy? We used the following criteria to determine whether to include works in our sample: Common factors are the primary focus of the work
The authors discuss common factors as applied to the practice of MFT
The work was published in a peer-reviewed journal or academic outlet between 1999 and early 2019. The authors have written about common factors extensively. Throughout the data analysis and discussion of the results, we met to discuss our position in relationship to common factors. We engaged in this process to acknowledge our position of support for common factors and our belief in their role as important aspects of therapeutic change; we also recognize there are significant limitations to the existing literature. Our aim was to provide a rigorous, honest, and critical commentary of the common factors literature in MFT, and we continually reminded ourselves of this aim throughout the analysis.

CNM people in same-gender relationships

Most childcare responsibilities for single parents Less time with parents
Non-coparents parenting more Expose Of Polycule to public
To COVID (for large networks) Yet, following these best practices has the potential to create or reinforce a relationship hierarchy among cohabiting and non-cohabiting partners or further isolate individuals living alone, according to Sheff (2020 b). In addition, more time among cohabiting partners and disagreements about social distancing practices could lead to tensions and relationship breakdown (Sheff, 2020 a). Single parents or parents working at home in particular may need to take on additional childcare responsibilities (Goldberg et al., 2021), potentially leading to less time with partners or non-coparent partners spending more time with children.
<a data-href="Queer Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/theory/queer-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Queer Theory</a> Include members who are not biologically or legally connected, and the queer sexuality when they form relationships with more than one person: disentangle romantic, sexual, and coparenting relationships; and include same-gender partners. May openly challenge heteronormative assumptions Not all relationship styles do this May prioritize safety Methods No discussion of the gender composition of the relationships Include members who are not biologically or legally connected, and they queer sexuality when they form relationships with more than one person; disentangle romantic, sexual, and coparenting relationships; and include same-gender partners. However, CNM relationships differ in their degree of compliance with and challenges to heteronormativity. For example, some polyamorous parents try to ‚Äúpass‚Äù as monogamous, whereas others come out and actively compel institutions or other people to recognize their families (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2010). Decreased contact Connection across distance
Distance from children Parents with less time with parents tended to not be cisgender women: only one of these seven parents was a cisgender woman or only a biological parent; rather, three were trans or nonbinary, two were cisgender men, and most were a&nbsp; combination of stepparents, nonbiological parents, biological parents, and adoptive parents.
Pandemic may have more of an impact on parent‚Äìchild relationships when one or more characteristics of parents deviates from the dominant heteronorm of the primary parent (i.e., female, biological).
The children lived with other parents prior to the pandemic, and in others, parents made the decision for children to live with different caregivers such as grandparents or coparents during the pandemic due to risk of exposure (e.g., parent was a frontline worker) or socialization considerations (e.g., the desire to give the child more time with other family members).
"A relationship, shared,&nbsp; a family, we decided it would be good for my kid to spend some time with my ex. Once that happened I have been able to visit my boyfriend twice (after 3 months apart). Both the kid and my ex is happier for the kid being up there.‚Äù Hsin-Yi‚Äôs account illustrates one way of resolving the desire to see their boyfriend and limit networks of risk exposure while also allowing their child to spend more time with other coparents. Changing dynamics and configurations at home More time at home ‚Ä¢This practice of incorporating multiple partners into a living unit could be beneÔ¨Åcial in having a ‚Äúlarge, robust household‚Äù to combat isolation, but also introduced challenges related to sharing space and dividing time among partners. Isabella, a bisexual white polyamorous stepmother to a toddler, elaborated: Fortunately, even those who discussed the stress of living in close quarters commented on the skills and strengths that they possessed as people who engaged in CNM, which enabled them to effectively communicate about their needs and boundaries.
But one thing polys are pretty good at is sort of working through issues as they arise.‚Äù‚ÄúSeveral parents spoke to the strengths of their communication and conflict resolution skills.
Another approach to spend more time with partners while avoiding some of the complications of moving everyone into the same house was creating multi-household quarantine pods, which sometimes further challenged heteronormative notions of family through the intentional and collaborative construction of small communities. Increased parenting responsibility Significant stress and desire for greater social support.
Support for parents was generally appreciated both by children and co-parents. Negotiating risk For some, this involved a process of pausing and unpausing CNM relationships as participants made decisions about safety and relative risk.
Newly exploring CNM, the pandemic seemed to at least temporarily foreclose the possibility of opening the relationship.
For other participants with established relationships, the labor and thought that went into seeing existing partners appeared to take priority over the work of trying to safely meet new partners.
Others noted their reluctance to meet with new individuals given the politicization of responses to COVID-19.
Perhaps because those in CNM relationships often have significant experience communicating needs and boundaries to partners (including negotiating expectations around safer sex behaviors), many participants mentioned the conversations they have with partners about COVID risk without characterizing them as challenging or conflictual.
Differences in protective measured ended some relationships. <br>In what ways are boundaries, as discussed by <a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a>, may be limiting to our understanding of CNM relationships? Is this concept limiting to our understanding of this population? Or is this concept purely expansive in our understanding of this relationship type?
During the pandemic, parents had less contact with partners outside of the home and focused more on the children and the biological mother or father of the children. Did the pandemic change the family processes? <br>Complexity (Effects of the Family Processes via Explanatory Pathways) (<a data-href="Mediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mediation</a>) Conflict affected child behavior problems through parent-to-child hostility in all family configurations except mother-child hostility in unrelated pairs (stepparents?)

The importance of studying everyday lives of families was highlighted and research methods like audio recording and daily diaries were crucial in furthering this area

This article distills insights from historical, sociological, and psychological perspectives on marriage to develop the suffocation model of marriage in America. According to this model, contemporary Americans are asking their marriage to help them fulÔ¨Åll different sets of goals than in the past. Whereas they ask their marriage to help them fulÔ¨Åll their physiological and safety needs much less than in the past, they ask it to help them fulÔ¨Åll their esteem and self-actualization needs much more than in the past. Asking the marriage to help them fulÔ¨Åll the latter, higher level needs typically requires sufÔ¨Åcient investment of time and psychological resources to ensure that the two spouses develop a deep bond and profound insight into each other‚Äôs essential qualities. Although some spouses are investing sufÔ¨Åcient resources‚Äîand reaping the marital and psychological beneÔ¨Åts of doing so‚Äîmost are not. Indeed, they are, on average, investing less than in the past. As a result, mean levels of marital quality and personal well-being are declining over time. According to the suffocation model, spouses who are struggling with an imbalance between what they are asking from their marriage and what they are investing in it have several promising options for corrective action: intervening to optimize their available resources, increasing their investment of resources in the marriage, and asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating the fulÔ¨Ållment of spouses‚Äô higher needs. Discussion explores the implications of the suffocation model for understanding dating and courtship, sociodemographic variation, and marriage beyond American‚Äôs borders.
Keywords: Marriage is a means to various ends, a pathway through which people pursue certain goals. Historical changes in American marriage since the late 1700 s, the time of the nation's founding, adopting the perspective that America has witnessed three dominant models of marriage. The first, which extended from the late 1700 s until around 1850, was a practical model in which marriage was primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their economic, political, and pragmatic goals. The second, from around 1850 until around 1965, was a breadwinner-homemaker model (which included romanticized and companionate subperiods) in which marriage was primarily oriented towards helping spouses meet their passion and intimacy needs. The third, from around 1865 until today, was (and continues to be) a self-expressive model in which marriage was (and is) primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their autonomy and personal growth needs. The primary functions of marriage have ascended Abraham Maslow's (1943, 1954/1970) hierarchy of needs, which, from bottom to top, encompasses physiological needs, safety needs, belonging and love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. The Suffocation Model
These tenets build upon three properties of Maslow's theory of human motivation. The first property is that needs people seek to fulfill are arranged hierarchically, with lower needs typically possessing greater motivational priority than higher needs. The second is that relative to the successful pursuit of higher needs (to achieve mastery, to experience personal growth, etc.) is more likely to require self-insight, and the development of such self-insight frequently requires considerable cognitive and psychological effort over a sustained period. The third is that the fulfillment of higher needs yields especially high levels of happiness, serenity, and richness of life. One central means through which Americans seek to fulfill their needs is through their marriage, especially as their access to nonspousal significant others has declined. Since the nation's founding, the extent to which Americans look to their marriage to help them fulfill their lower needs has decreased, whereas the extent to which they look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs has increased. Just as the pursuit of higher needs frequently requires substantial insights into the self, looking to the marriage to help individuals fulfill their higher needs frequently requires that each spouse have substantial insight into the partner, and the development of such insight into the partner, and the development of such insight typically requires considerable communication and responsiveness over a sustained period. Even as Americans increasingly look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs, they have, on average, reduced their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage. In conjunction, the resource imbalance, resulting from the trends described in Tenets 2, 3, and 4 - insufficient investment to meet the emphasis on higher needs - has undermined spouses' marital quality and personal well-being (although those spouses who manage to invest sufficient resources experience especially strong marital quality and personal well-being). Spouses experiencing the adverse effects described in Tenet 5 have three general options for ameliorating or reversing these consequences: Optimizing their usage of the resources that are available
Increasing their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage
Asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating their higher needs. The contemporary American model of marriage is the product of a succession of cultural developments that altered marriage's raisons d'etre over time. These raisons d'etre shifted from: Economics, politics, and pragmatism (late 1700s to 1850)
Passion and affection (1850 to 1965)
Self-expression and personal growth (1965 to the present) Burgess and Locke (1945) characterized the shift from the first to the second emphasis as a transition from institutional to companionate marriage, and Cherline (2009) characterized the shift from the second to the third emphasis as a transition from companionate to individualistic, or self-expressive, marriage. It is important to recognize that, as with biological evolution, cultural evolution is more of a tinkering process than an engineering process. <br>Sociologist Ernest Burgess characterized institutional marriages as formal institutions that were strictly regulated by law, social norms, and religion. (<a data-href="Institutional Marriage" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Institutional Marriage</a>) According to Burgess, farm families dominated the marital landscape prior to the last few decades of the nineteenth century. In early America, strong and stable marriages were essential to the welfare of family members and the larger community. Family members relied on one another to meet basic needs, including economic production, child care, education, and elder care. Marriage also created bonds between families that facilitated the sharing of resources. Because cohesive, stable, and interconnected families were necessary for survival, society had an interest in regulating marriage and the behavior of individual spouses. In this model, the stability of the family was more important than the needs of the individual family members. Children typically were not allowed to marry without parental permission, and divorce was unacceptable except in the most extreme cases of abuse or abandonment. The raisons d‚ÄôÀÜ etre of marriage were, both directly and indirectly (via broader social processes), related to lower needs in Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy. Spouses looked to their marriage to help them fulfill physiological needs such as having enough food to eat, keeping warm in the winter, and having a place to sleep in inclement weather. Spouses also looked to their marriage to help them fulfill safety needs such as being protected from violent attack, having a predictable daily existence, and maintaining a sense of economic security.
In many late-1700 s American communities, market economies were strengthening, which began to enable young Americans to work for wages outside their home and to settle at greater distances from their family of origin. At the same time, the influence of Protestant churches, which had historically exerted substantial control over young adults‚Äô marital choices, was declining. These changes dovetailed with an Enlightenment-era worldview that valued the so-called natural passions, including love and romantic desire. Such economic, geographic, and philosophical developments began to reduce the influence of parental approval in marital decisions, which afforded individuals greater freedom in selecting a spouse, trends that rapidly accelerated staring around 1850. Even with the trend toward wage labor outside the home, there was still a need for someone to attend to domestic tasks. For a wife to specialize in domestic production was often efficient, especially given women‚Äôs unique biological contributions to childbearing and early childrearing, and having women adopt the homemaking role aligned with prevalent views of women as delicate, virtuous, and sensitive. As wives' labor became less central to household economic success, society shifted to sentimental reasons for marriage. "As the new rules surrounding marriage relaxed, a new idea gained prominence: rather being based on a code of obligations to society and religion, marriage should be based on ties of affection and companionship between spouses.

Title: Systemic family therapy can be manualized: research process and findings, Author: Pote, H.; Stratton, P.; Cottrell, D.; Shapiro, D.; Boston, P.; Journal: Journal of Family Therapy, Volume: 25,

Determining the efficacy of therapeutic interventions is becoming an increasing political and ethical necessity. Comparative therapeutic outcome trials are most powerful when there is a precise specification, or manualization, of the forms that therapies took. Manuals have begun to be developed for structural/behavioral family therapy and couple therapy. The development of these manuals is often reliant on experts' self‚Äêreport, rather than a systematic analysis of the therapeutic process as it happens. This can limit their validity and applicability to standard clinical practice. In addition, no manuals exist which reflect less structured forms of family therapy aimed at incorporating systemic, postmodern and narrative frameworks. The feasibility of producing a workable manual that reflects the fluidity of such practices has been questioned. A research project to systematically create and test such a manual is reported. Multiple data sources and research methods, primarily qualitative, were applied to generate a rich specification of the therapy. In reporting these results the contents of various aspects of the final manual are indicated. Procedures to ensure that the prescribed practice is consistent with a widely used approach to systemic family therapy are also described. The manual will be an important tool for outcome research and therapeutic practice. The account of the research process should be helpful to researchers engaged in constructing a manual for other models of family therapy based on a rigorous analysis of actual practice. The manual itself is available for use by outcome researchers who wish to evaluate this widely used form of systemic family therapy.
Keywords: Need to Read There has been a tendency for the more easily specified and measurable to be privileged. It has been a common strategy for manuals to be defined and specified anecdotally by senior practitioners. These practices in manual development and outcome research may risk the development of a 'biased' evidence base. Easily prescribable cognitive-behavior techniques applied to specific diagnostic categories have been manualized before more complex psychotherapeutic techniques with more general application. Have you experienced this in your clinical work? Have you struggled to find resources or anything to provide structure to your sessions? If some therapists have more manualized theories than others, does that create a difference in outcome for clients? Are we really systemic researchers if we are only observing the individual self-report data? Are there familial/relational measures looking at more than one person in the family? How much of our understanding is the individuals that make up the system or the interactions between them?
"The result is that therapists and researchers alike remain unclear about what constitutes effective family therapy."
"Examples of manuals detailing less structured, systemic family therapy are limited, since until recently the ethos of these forms of family therapy has worked against anything that might look like a prescription of what the therapist should do." But have we? Therapists were required to retrospectively rate their intentions in relation to the systemic practices they observed in videotape reviews of their own therapy practice. Ratings of 26 possible intentions were given on a five-point Likert scale relating to the extent to which therapists felt they were being guided by this intention during their practice. Manuals specify different modes of clinical practice and enable comparisons of model efficacy through controlled outcome trials. In order for the findings from outcome research to be clinically relevant and meaningful, the manuals used must offer a fair representation of practices within the contexts in which the therapy is usually delivered. Within the systemic manuals that currently exist, there has been a tendency for the more easily specified and measurable to be privileged. It has also been a common strategy for manuals to be defined and specified anecdotally by senior practitioners in the field, with less reliance on therapy process research from clinical contexts. These current practices in manual development and outcome research may risk the development of a 'biased' evidence base. Across psychotherapy, easily prescribable cognitive-behavior techniques applied to specific diagnostic categories have been manualized before more complex psychotherapeutic techniques with more general application. Within family therapy the strategy has resulted in more behaviorally oriented forms being manualized and shown to be effective for specific conditions. A common criticism of outcome research is of a lack of generalizability to everyday practice. Participants are unrepresentative, as they have usually been screened to exclude any with multiple difficulties; the therapy is delivered to a higher. Standard and in more tightly defined form than is possible in normal practice; and most evidence will have accumulated about older forms of therapy. More applicable research would be facilitated by the availability of a manual derived from representative current practice, in a format that allows for current developments and the emphases of clinics in which it would be implemented. It should also be designed to consider <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> with the usual range and complexity of family difficulties. Family therapy is effective when compared with no treatment controls and, for some presenting difficulties, is more efficacious than individual interventions (e.g. marital distress, anorexia in young adolescents). Family therapy may also have advantages over individual treatments in relation to engagement and client ratings of satisfaction. Family therapy may also be more cost-effective than residential and inpatient treatments, but may not be sufficient in itself to address a variety of severe disorders and problems (e.g. schizophrenia, adolescents‚Äô conduct difficulties).
Systemic psychotherapy research is full of methodological flaws. Design issues, such as small and sometimes unrepresentative participant samples and the lack of credible no-treatment and alternative treatment controls, continue to undermine the conclusions of the research. It is easy to become lost in the multitude of definitions of what constitutes the family therapy interventions assessed, if, that is, the researchers have defined the interventions at all. The result is that therapists and researchers alike remain unclear about what constitutes effective family therapy. Examples of manuals detailing less structured, systemic family therapy are limited, since until recently the ethos of these forms of family therapy has worked against anything that might look like a prescription of what the therapist should do. The key stages in the research process Semi-structured interviews with five expert family therapists, with qualitative and quantitative analysis. Observational ratings of fifteen videotapes of expert family therapy sessions, using a specifically developed observational rating schedule and employing quantitative analysis. Development of a draft manual. Trial of the manual in practice by three experienced family therapists to obtain qualitative feedback and ascertain quantitative self-report of adherence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by the first author with five expert family therapists from LFTRC. An adapted version of the Brief Structured Recall (BSR) method was used to structure interviews. Therapists were required to retrospectively rate their intentions in relation to the systemic practices they observed in videotape reviews of their own therapy practice. The process used to elicit accounts of the kinds of therapeutic practice the therapists would report when confronted with samples of their own practice. Ratings of 26 possible intentions were given on a five-point Likert scale relating to the extent to which therapists felt they were being guided by this intention during their practice. Using the BSR method, therapists were also asked to comment on the theoretical ideas that were informing their practice. Through this recursive process the following guiding principles were produced: Systems Focus: In working systemically the central focus should be upon the system rather than the individual, particularly in relation to the difficulties and issues that the family system brings to therapy. Connections and Patterns: In understanding relationships and difficulties within systems it will be important for the therapist to consider the connections between circular patterns of behaviors within systems. This process of therapy should enable family members to consider these connections from new and/or different perspectives. <br><a data-href="Circular Causality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/circular-causality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Circular Causality</a> (Circularity): Patterns of behavior develop within systems, which are repetitive and circular in nature and also constantly evolving. <br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>: Meaning is created in the social interactions that take place between people and is thus context dependent and constantly changing. The negotiation of a shared meaning, constructed afresh in each conversation, takes precedence over the concept of a single external reality. Strengths and Solutions: the therapist should take a non-pathologizing, positive view of the family system, and the current difficulties they are struggling with. The therapist should attend to the strengths and solutions in the stories that the family system brings to therapy. Cultural Context: The therapist should consider the importance of context, in relation to the cultural meanings and narratives within which people live their lives, including issues of race, gender, disability, religion, and class. The relationship between these narratives, the therapeutic relationship and its context, as well as the wider context for the therapeutic team and the family, should be an important consideration at the point of referral and throughout the therapy. Co-Constructed Practice: In therapeutic interactions reality is co-constructed between the therapist (and team) and the people with whom they meet. Reflexivity: Therapists should aim to apply systemic thinking to themselves and thus reject any thinking about families and their processes that does not also apply to therapists and therapy. In order to use self-reflexivity it will be necessary for therapists to be alert to their own constructions, functioning, and prejudices. Narratives and Language: behaviors and beliefs form the basis of stories or narratives, which are constructed by, around, and between individuals and the system itself. The language that is used to describe these narratives and the interactions between individuals construct the reality of their every day lives. <br><a data-href="Power" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/power.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Power</a>: The therapist should take a reflexive stance in relation to the power differentials that exist within the therapeutic relationship, and within the family relationships. <br><a data-href="Constructivism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/constructivism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Constructivism</a>: The idea that each person constitutes an autonomous meaning system and will interpret and make sense of information from this frame of reference. The systemic family therapy methods outlined through this process were: Teamwork, including the use of a designated ‚Äòsecretary‚Äô from the therapy team to communicate with the family pre-therapy; Communications between the therapist, team and family through earbugs and telephones; Structuring sessions and feedback from the team through breaks and reflecting team discussions; Videotaping therapy sessions; Consultations to the wider system before and during therapy; Use of reading seminars to develop team thinking. Systemic family therapy techniques were more varied, with nineteen classifications including circular questioning, externalizing the problem, tracking life events and paying attention to language used. The categories were simplified for the purposes of a coding system, and the final categories were grouped into four sections: Therapist‚Äôs intention ‚Äì the intervention that the therapist was observed to be attempting to implement, for example, reframing.
Family trigger event ‚Äì the immediate actions of a family member before the therapist event, for example, talking about the problem.
Therapist techniques ‚Äì the type of therapist event, for example, the use of a statement or circular question.
Content of the discussion ‚Äì the overall theme of the therapist and family interaction for each therapist speech act, for example, talking about solutions. Findings showed that therapists used different types of technique according to the kind of intervention they were intending to achieve. <br>The technique which therapists used most frequenrly was asking linear questions, though they often used these in a circular fashion, moving around the family to vuild up a picture of events from everyone's persepctive. More complex intentions were associated with <a data-href="Circular Questioning" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/circular-questioning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Circular Questioning</a>, and statements were used to clearly distinguish team and therapists' ideas. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/advanced-research-methods-(hdfs-7780)/readings/@potesystemicfamilytherapy2003.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Advanced Research Methods (HDFS 7780)/Readings/@poteSystemicFamilyTherapy2003.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 15:53:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.

Examples: Economic and exchange theories Assume that all behavior is reducible to rewards/costs of behavioral exchanges. <br>Attachment theory (<a data-href="Attachment Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/attachment-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attachment Theory</a>) Assumes that our template for socializing with people can be primarily explained by the relationship with have with a primary attachment figure. <br>Family Systems Theory (<a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a>) Assumes all behaviors are linked to the larger social unit of analysis. While each of these are partly true, not every interaction we have in a relationship is rationale (e.g., Exchange theory: sometimes we make costly decisions in a relationship even when we know another behavior my help the relationship are we more motivated for ourselves or the relationship? Attachment theory Although our relationship with primary caregivers are important in childhood, attachment theory doesn‚Äôt necessarily deal with genetic, personality, or environmental constraints/affordances that can shape these relationships; Family systems: although family dynamics are powerful, where is the role of autonomy and self-efficacy that can explain shifts away from embedded family norms and patterns of behaviors?) Concepts are the key features of a theory. These are the ideas/concepts (often variables) that we measure and focus on when we think of theory. For example, if you were interested in conducting a study around (social exchange, attachment, or family systems theory) what would you potentially be interested in measuring in your study? ‚Äì give an example if none come up). Exactly, concepts are the ideas/constructs that allow us to think/apply the theory to something we are interested in studying. These are the hypotheses based on the assumptions and constructs in a given theory. For example, one proposition we might pull from social exchange theory is that in a relationship, when potential alternatives (e.g., other partners) seem more rewarding than our current relationships, we could expect someone might choose to end the relationship or cheat. For attachment theory, we could hypothesize that when someone is high in the anxiety dimension of attachment, they might seem more reassurance from their partner than someone lower in anxiety. For family systems, we could hypothesize that when families have rigid boundaries, it may be harder to intervene and change a child‚Äôs problematic behavior than if the family had less rigid boundaries.

Throughout the semester, we will talk about theories that are grand/abstract/critical‚Äîthey present a big picture way of viewing the world. To mid-range or lower-range theories that attempt to explain and provide specific hypotheses about families or specific family behaviors/outcomes. This idea is helpful to keep in mind as not all theories are well-suited for every level of analysis. Some theories may be better suited for certain methodologies than others. We primarily use contextual theory.

Conflicts between different paradigms/theories are often a function of politics, which my also reflect societal changes in the U.S.

This also helps us understand how certain fields have similar concepts with different names.
Give examples‚Äîspanking research by Liz Gershoff, minority vs minoritized Using contextual theory, fam scientists have integrated multiple philosophies (e.g., the uncertainty of measurement conceptualized through alphas and p-values to inform falsification/hypothesis testing). Also, family scientists are skeptics that many concepts are made up and can never know if they fully match Reality.
Also use operationalization (logical empiricists) to measure concepts while acknowledging that they may imprecisely match theory and observation.
‚ÄúWhen it comes to theory testing, most family theorists are aware of the limits of falsification, but within those limits are comfortable employing its procedures. ‚Äú
‚ÄúMost family scientists believe in verification, sometimes implicitly using Bayesian concepts of probability, so that our confidence in an abstract or contextual theory increases with additional empirical support.‚Äù
‚ÄúHowever, family scientists believe that an accumulation of differently flawed observations can begin to approximate the boundaries of Reality. ‚Äú ‚ÄúFamily scientists are mostly reasonable realists who anticipate that there is probably a ‚ÄúReal World‚Äù out there; we really do believe there are families. However, we also recognize that there are many distinct but overlapping perspectives (frameworks) from which family life can be multiple and simultaneously understood. ‚Äú
‚ÄúFamily scientists are reasonable skeptics who recognize that many, if not most, of our concepts are made up from our imaginations, and that we will never know how much‚Äîor if‚Äîthey match Reality.‚Äù ‚ÄúMini revolutions, ‚Äùe.g., Family scientists integrate multiple theories to make sense of the world
Challenge of Meaning ‚ÄúSupernatural explanations for disease, divine spheres for planetary motion, falling objects seeking their proper place, and the ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù of economics were replaced by germs, gravity, and individual preference schedules do . Why people think they are ill, where a falling object ‚Äúwants‚Äù to be: these sorts of meaning-based explanations are no longer proposed. In these historical cases, meaning explanations have been replaced by causal explanations. ‚ÄúIn the end, both realists and skeptics agree that there are limits to what we can know, so whether improved explanations are closer to Truth as realists claim or more useful as practical understanding as skeptics claim, it doesn‚Äôt actually make a difference in what we do with our explanations. ‚Äú Who defines the concepts? How often do we reevaluate the theoretical frameworks that outline our understanding of families?
How might theoretical frameworks help control the ways in which family life is defined and understood within research? Thoughts about theory as described through metaphor? Is our ability to describe theory through metaphor a signal of the utility/practicality of a theory?
Will family science have its Newton, who will create a new, grand theoretical framework to replace all the current ones? Coleman (1990) ‚Äìwould it be useful to have a grand theory of family dynamics?
What might be some examples of the ‚Äúchallenge of meaning‚Äù in HDFS/family science/ your own area?
‚ÄúOne thing we learned from Kuhn is that research is accepted when it is persuasive. What is considered persuasive does not distinguish realists from skeptics.‚Äù Thoughts about this quote (p 17) The Institute for Population Research &amp; Census are examples of what demographers do.
May sound familiar as you often need to include ‚Äúdemographics‚Äù in your research projects.
Traditionally defined as studying three population processes, fertility, mortality, and migrations. More modern conceptualizations are social demography that seek to study population processes that may not fully align with these big three (e.g., Family Demography is a big field). Family Demography typically two types of studies: Careful tracking and measurement of families at either a given time point or trends over time. Focus on the social, cultural, and economic correlates, precursors, and consequences of family structure and transitions. ‚ÄúDiverging Destinies‚Äù framework, articulated by McLanahan (2004), indicates that families are increasingly dissimilar across social class lines, often proxied by educational attainment.
A theme you will notice about a lot of demographic and sociological explanations is that they take an economic or structural approach to understanding families, marriage, child-birth, and development.

Most young people still aspire to marriage, yet current trends suggest a retreat from marriage.
Declining in married adults partly explained by older age at first marriage (delay in marriage) and fewer people getting married (retreat from marriage). Lower marriage rates for Black Americans (i.e., growing black-white differences in marriage rates). But also true for Hispanic and AINA than White and API women) ‚Äì Why though? Those with higher SES more likely be married (true for White and Black women). May be explained by economic ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù the people link to marriage (it has become a luxury good), which is not as available to those without college degrees.
May be explained by marriage market availability and mass incarceration. Second Demographic Transition and the ‚Äúsingles are coming‚Äù
Remarriage and divorce remain common. Longer time to remarriage for black and Latina women compared to white women.
Highest remarriage rates for higher educational levels Post-divorce cohabitation may be replacing marriage given the high divorce rate.
Remarriage = more stepfamilies. Divorce rates increased steadily between 1960 and rates remain high since 1970s, but divorce rates have declined since 1980s (though still historically high). May continue to decline as younger adults have lower divorce rates. Paired with older ages of marriage, young adults who marry may also be a select group of more committed people. <br>Greater divorces rates among older Americans (i.e., 50+) has been called the ‚Äú<a data-href="Grey Divorce" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/grey-divorce.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grey Divorce</a>‚Äù Largely driven by baby boomers who had high rates of dissolution to begin with. Divorce is dramatically stratified by education with up to 60% of those without HS or GED getting divorced (isn‚Äôt it expensive? And might this contribute to income inequality given that divorce and relationship dissolution is typically costly?). Smaller educational difference for Black women compared to White women, but overall the differences between White and Black women, Black women‚Äôs marriages were more likely to dissolve. ‚ÄúSince the early 2000s, the relationship between divorce rates and unemployment rates has been negative; that is, when unemployment went down, the divorce rate went up, and when unemployment went up (as during the Great Recession), divorce rates went down‚Äù Small effects
Recessions delayed rather than forgoing divorce.
When men become unemployed when separated, tend to delays divorce.
When in economic straights, may be likely to forgo divorce unless remarriage is on the horizon. Marriage may be delayed but people are still not delaying living with intimate partners.
Rates of cohabitation with different gender partner sped up since the 1970s.
Most women cohabitate by there mid-late twenties. Cohabitation also common among those 50+.
Very common to live with a spouse beforehand.
Marriage or dissolutions following cohabitation within 2-3 years. Lower likelihood of cohabitation if at least a bachelor‚Äôs degree. College-educated women were more likely to transition into marriage from cohabitation than less educated women.
Cohabitation is more of a steppingstone to marriage, especially for the more economically disadvantaged
Decoupling of marriage and childbearing, as evidenced by increase in cohabitation and retreat from marriage. Increase in non-marital births largely attributed to cohabitating couples. Cohabitation used to be associated with marital instability, but more recent studies do not show this trend. Explanations were selection (cohabitators had more positive attitudes towards divorce).
Experiences while cohabiting deterred people from marriage (trial marriage hypothesis).
White women who cohabited were more likely to divorce compared to Black and Mexican American women.
Cohabitation may stabilize remarriage.
Explanation for disappearing cohabitation may be the normative nature of it. Research from other countries supports this idea. Fertility rates of in US have largely declined since 1970s, with a slight increase between 1990s and 2007, after which they continued to fall ‚Äì this is the case across racial/ethnic groups. Decline since 2007 largely due to declines in birth among young women. Teen births are at an all-time low.
US has higher TFR than most European countries, but still below replacement level fertility.
Great recession reduced fertility somewhat among younger women, but its unclear if this is a termporary or a longer-term effect.
Big decline in fertility for Hispanic immigrants, likely because the recession reduced immigration from Mexico.
Not clear why ‚ÄúLonger term structural changes, especially the decline of manufacturing and construction, also depress fertility; thus fertility rates may be unlikely to rebound soon (Seltzer, 2019).‚Äù
Educational differences in children are relatively small, but more educated women tend to have fewer children. However, recent evidence suggests that fertility rates are increasing among women with advanced degrees. May be explained by these women's ability to outsource childcare, availability of childcare has increased, and spouses participate more in childcare.\
Women college graduates also delay childbirth. 40% of all births are to unmarried women ‚Äì also, something like 30% - 50% of pregnancies are unintended This tends to be more common for women with less than HS degree (also a group that is less likely to get married and more likely to get divorced.)
Non-marital births are increasing for white women, which has contributed to smaller differences in non-marital child birth differences between white/black women. Multi-partner fertility has increased 14%-25% in general ‚Äî higher in unmarried families and cohabitating families.
Less associated with martial fertility in stepfamilies and non-marital fertility. Covid led to a baby ‚Äúbust.‚Äù
Same-gender unions Somewhere between 500-800k married same gender couples. Married and cohabitating same-gender couples tend to have higher SES. More schooling
Both partners employed
Slightly more white
Higher median household income Male same-gender couples tend to have higher SES (because of patriarchy).
Same-gender couples are less likely to have children (there are many barriers to having children if they aren‚Äôt from a previous relationship). Higher rates of childrearing among female same-gender couples. Education gradient in child rearing is more dramatic at higher than lower levels of education for same-gender couples (they have fewer children).
‚ÄúSame-gender couples with children in the home tend to have less education, lower median incomes, and higher poverty rates than different-gender parents despite the fact that same-gender couples as a whole have higher incomes and education than different-gender couples.‚Äù When controlling for relevant factors, children in female same-sex couple households have similar poverty rates as those in different gender households. "Controlling for education, demographic, marital status, and health measures, lesbian women and gay men are not more likely to be poor than heterosexuals, but bisexual women and men are more likely to be poor (Badgett, 2018).‚Äù We don‚Äôt really understand why bisexual people have poorer outcomes. Adoption rates are higher among same-gender unions Still lots of challenges in accessing pathways to parenthood and adoption. Overall decline in parenthood among same-gender couples.
Greater dissolution among female same-gender couples. ‚ÄúSince the Great Recession, legal immigration has leveled off, and the size of the undocumented immigrant population has remained relatively constant or declined somewhat, depending on the estimate.‚Äù
Foreign born population has stayed around 15% between 1890 and 2017
‚Ä¢Most immigrants are from the Americas, particularly, Mexico‚Ä¢‚ÄúAs of 2017, the largest groups of immigrants are from South and East Asia (27%), Mexico (25%), other countries in Latin America (25%), and Europe or Canada (13%; Radford &amp; Noe-Bustamante, 2019).‚Äù‚Ä¢Marriage is common 61%, may be due to them being younger/typical age for marriage‚Ä¢24% of Hispanic women will separate or get divorced ‚Äì this rate has been increasing slowly‚Ä¢There is quite a bit of heterogeneity in divorce rates based on specific ethnic groups (important point to acknowledge when talking about race/ethnicity that‚Äôs not covered here.)‚Ä¢‚Äúimmigration enforcement between 2005 and 2015 raised the likelihood that undocumented mothers lived without their spouses by 20% and the likelihood that Hispanic U.S.-born children lived without their parents by 19%‚Äù‚Ä¢Separations are associated with increased poverty, fear, stress, anxiety, and depression‚Ä¢Births to foreign-born women are a large proportion of all births‚Ä¢In 2014, 23% of U.S.-born babies had foreign-born mothers.

Based on observed changes across countries throughout the world that are experiencing different paces of industrialization (things like the industrial revolutions, advances in germ theory, access to clean water, hygiene, food availability, and wars)
Good summary: This is a state of high birth and death rates culminating in low population growth overall.
With a consistently high birth rate and decreasing death rate, population growth surges.
As the birth rate falls and the death rate remains low, the population continues to increase.
Traditionally considered to be the final stage, this is one of demographic stabilization, in which both birth and death rates are low. This means that the overall population stays fairly low.
This final, contested stage may predict higher or lower fertility levels depending on which theorist you ask. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/demographic-transition.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Theoretical Perspectives on the Family (HDFS 8820)/Key Terms and Concepts/Demographic Transition.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:55:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/demographic-transitions.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/demographic-transitions.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[@baptistFamilySystemsTheory2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Family systems theory holds special significance for the field of family science. In fact, a family systems perspective, or seeing the whole as greater than the sum of the individual parts, is ‚Äúcore‚Äù to the discipline‚Äôs identity and much of what makes family science ‚Äúa unique and unified discipline.‚Äù Consequently, this chapter describes the origins of general systems and family systems theories, outlines the theory‚Äôs core assumptions and key concepts, describes three middle-range theories of note, identifies limitations of the theory, and offers suggestions for growth and expansion of systems theory. In order to demonstrate how a theoretical framework can be challenged by collectivist culture, we use empirical exemplars highlighting Asian American family science in an illustration. This endeavor seems timely given that this chapter is written during the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-Asian racism is on the rise in the United States.
<br>Systems theory emerged in the 1920 s when <a data-href="Ludwig von Bertalanffy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a>, an Austrian biologist, proposed a systems approach in the production and implementation of defense systems in order to optimize efficiency, success, and network interactions.
In 1954, von Bertalanffy, along with biomathematician Anatol Rapoport, economist Kenneth Boulding, and physiologist Ralph Gerard founded the Society for General Systems Research.
In the late 1940s, independent from von Bertalanffy, Norbert Weiner, a philosopher and mathematician, tried to unite mechanists, who saw living organisms functioning like machines, and vitalists who saw little connection between laws governing living and nonliving things. Weiner (1948) contributed the principles of homeostasis and self-regulation through feedback. Before the 1900s, there were no theories dedicated to analyzing families. The concept of the family system was fundamental to Talcott Parsons‚Äô structural functional theory, the most important paradigm in the field of sociology during the 1940s and 1950s. Parson and Bales (1955) identified a four-role family system to include the instrumental leader, the expressive leader, the instrumental follower and the expressive follower.
Structural functional theory was more concerned about conformism in defense of the system to the point of neglecting the system‚Äôs equally important need for, and capacity to, change. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/readings/3.-family-systems-&amp;-paren-child-relationships/@baptistfamilysystemstheory2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Theoretical Perspectives on the Family (HDFS 8820)/Readings/3.

To develop your writing and critical thinking skills, both of which are essential for success in graduate school and beyond, you will be turning in weekly reaction papers. These papers will be written in response to the readings for that week. What should you talk about in your reaction papers? The papers should be a comment on the theory and research for that week. It can be an idea for further research or theory, a new way of applying one of the articles, a criticism, or an integration or comparison between two or more articles. Do not summarize. I have read the articles already. In these papers I am expecting you to come up with an original idea that in some way extends our understanding of the topic. At the end of each reaction paper, you should pose at least one discussion question. Some considerations when posing your questions: Your question should be related to the thought/reflection that you develop (i.e., provide a rationale for asking the question)‚ÄîI am as interested in your thought processes as I am in the question itself. If you question the methodology of a particular study, be sure you are clear as to why there may be a methodological problem.
Possible answers the question; (i.e., Don‚Äôt ask rhetorical questions and try to ask questions that go beyond the material); 3.) Avoid asking the same questions every week; 4.) Be sure the question is discussable. Papers should be about 2 pages, double-spaced. You are required to turn in 11 reaction papers, but you will have opportunity to write one for 13 weeks. I will take the 11 highest grades. You will upload your paper to Carmen by 11:59pm the Tuesday before class‚Äîthis will allow time for me and your classmates (see below) to integrate your questions into the presentation and discussion for a give article. Please make sure you proofread your writing for grammar and spelling errors. One strategy that may be helpful is reading the paper out loud prior to turning a paper in. Your reaction papers will be graded on the criteria show in the following rubric:

Title: Beyond the Dyad: a Review of the Novel Insights Gained From Studying Consensual Non-monogamy, Author: Balzarini, Rhonda N.; Muise, Amy; Journal: Current Sexual Health Reports, Volume: 12,
Issue: 4
Pages: 398-404
Year: 2020 DOI: 10.1007/s11930-020-00297-x

Purpose of Review:
The purpose of this review is to highlight the major advancements in our understanding of consensually nonmonogamous (CNM) relationships‚Äîor intimate relationships between three or more people who are non-exclusive sexually and/ or emotionally. We aim to review key insights from research on the benefits (i.e., diversification of need fulfillment) and challenges (i.e., continued stigma) of CNM relationships and how research on CNM highlights some limitations of the existing theories of relationships.
Recent Findings The last two decades have seen a trend towards increasing diversity of family structures. Although monogamy remains the most common relationship structure, CNM relationships are increasing in prevalence and in interest to both lay people and researchers. Recent research has begun to uncover novel insights into who is more likely to be drawn to and engage in CNM, how CNM relationships compare to monogamous relationships, and the potential benefits and challenges of engaging in CNM relationships.
Summary While people in CNM relationships still experience stigma, for those who desire such relationships, CNM can be a viable and healthy alternative to monogamy, and may even help people meet more of their needs through diversifying need fulfillment across multiple partners. Despite this, many existing relationship theories are not inclusive of CNM relationship experiences and aspects of existing theories of positive relationships and sexuality may not extend to people in CNM relationships. Moving forward it is important to consider whether our concepts and measures are inclusive to people in diverse relationships, including those in CNM relationships. <br>Keywords: <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Consensual-Non-Monogamy" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Consensual-Non-Monogamy">#Consensual-Non-Monogamy</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Need-Fulfillment" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Need-Fulfillment">#Need-Fulfillment</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Relationship-Quality" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Relationship-Quality">#Relationship-Quality</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Romantic-Relationship" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Romantic-Relationship">#Romantic-Relationship</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Sexuality" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Sexuality">#Sexuality</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Stigma" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Stigma">#Stigma</a> <br>‚ÄúThose who desire such relationships, CNM can be a viable and healthy alternative to monogamy (e.g., it can be just as satisfying as a monogamous relationship; and having multiple simultaneous relationships can help people meet more of their fundamental needs.‚Äù <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BSP2WNMT?page=2&amp;annotation=JWBCBFUU" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/zotero:/open-pdf/library/items/BSP2WNMT?page=2&amp;annotation=JWBCBFUU" target="_self">(Balzarini and Muise, 2020, p. 399)</a> <br>

Title: The Demography of Families: A Review of Patterns and Change, Author: Smock, Pamela J; Schwartz, Christine R; Journal: Journal of Marriage and Family, Pages: 9-34
Year: 2022 The authors review demographic trends and research on families in the United States, with a special focus on the past decade. They consider the following several topics: (a) marriage and remarriage, (b) divorce, (c) cohabitation, (d) fertility, (e) same-gender unions, (f) immigrant families, and (g) children‚Äôs living arrangements. Throughout, the authors review both overall trends and patterns as well as those by social class and race‚Äìethnicity. The authors discuss major strands of recent research, emphasizing emerging themes and promising directions. They close with a summary of central patterns and trends and conclude that recent trends are not as uniform as they tended to be in earlier decades, making the description of family change increasingly complex.

HDFS journals is minimal (10%-20%). Usually rejected for fit, editor may not like your topic, 3 reviewers if paper has potential, reviewers are people in my field who give extensive paragraph, 3 primary options (accepted (very rare), revise and resubmit (common, substantial changes need to be made, may need to do a couple times for it to be accepted), rejections (happens frequently, still getting feedback, feedback is always something you can improve)) Time you submit to when you get it back (3-5 months usually to get paper back) How much time you take on a paper will vary
Average time is about a year to a year and a half (if paper is accepted by place you submitted) (publishing early matters)
Revise and resubmit Institute of Medicine, standards of authorship, Are your consultations based on this person teaching you how to do it and you do it on your own, or it is them just doing it for you. That could change authorship. You want your work to serve multiple purposes and how can I make a paper out of it? Talk to faculty when ideas are flowing to understand if your idea is something that you can actually make happen Be broad on what you are choosing to work with others. Be thoughtful if project will be a drag on my time or be something that excites me.

Myth of Fusion: Human's must come to grips with 'aloneness.' Once we accept our aloneness then we have to make meaning for our lives. "We believe people who love us should 'just know' what we need."
We have to accept we are a self. Once we accept our aloneness, we must make meaning of our lives. Freedom and Responsibility
Humanistic Psychology: Humans are good and move toward growth if unhindered. Whitaker and others claim to be a-theoretical. However, Whitaker was a systems theorist and used ideas from humanistic psychology and psychoanalytic theory to guide his therapy. <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a> thought he could change a family behind a mirror by telling a therapist what to do. Experiential therapists did not believe this is true. They want the family to be open to their emotional experience and thoughts they are having. Anti-Technician: Rather than a-theoretical, Whitaker and other experiential therapists are anti-technician. Manipulation does not encourage open experiencing. Through feeling expression, families are able to balance separateness and connectedness. Always 'becoming' or moving forward, toward growth. Emotions/affect are validated and nurtured. Rules create balance: respect for affect and getting along. Permeable boundaries which encourage expression of intimacy needs, differentiation, bonding, conflict expression/resolution, problem solving, and playfulness. Symptoms develop when affect is blocked, impulses are denied and feelings are suppressed. Boundaries and processes are rigid: holding themselves together is more important than experiencing life. Superficial experience of emotion, self-denial, lack of empathy, lack of commitment, inability to handle conflict
Little awareness, little sense of choice, flow of behavior is blocked because of unexpressed emotion.
<br><a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> suggested that there were 3 contexts to our symptoms: 'Driven Crazy' in an interpersonal context in which person is belittled or disqualified.
'Going Crazy' a state of temporary disorganization.
'Acting Crazy' an adaptation to the context. Increased personal integrity, greater freedom of choice, less dependence, expanded experiencing. Strengthening the family as a system by increasing connectedness within the nuclear family and across generations. Enhance ability to support the completion of developmental tasks. Battle for Structure
Battle for Initiative
Working Phase
Termination
Use of non-rational, symbol, and metaphor. Use of self is paramount: any technique comes from the therapist's creativity. Create a new therapeutic environment to alter the family's interaction in hopes of producing a different affective experience. Interrupt rigid, repetitive cycles
Activate and allow for constructive anxiety or confusion. Expand the presenting problem
Encourage and support any new decision (freedom to choose). Create trans-generational boundaries. Create a therapeutic supra-system in which the therapist and family are aligned, and the therapist still has the ability to differentiate (get in and get out). Self-Worth: How people learn to be people Communication: The ways people use to work out meaning with one another (Placating, Blaming, Computing, Distracting, Leveling/Congruence) Placating (peacekeeper)
Blamer (im not happy its your fault)
Computing (have to have a rational explanation, ultra rationale)
Distracting (acts out when there is stress, someone who uses humor)
Leveling/Congruence Rules: The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into the family system. Freedom to comment: What can you say
To whom can you say it
How do you go about it if you disagree or disapprove of someone or something
How do you question when you do not understand
Taboo subjects
Taboo feelings
Expressing affection
Secrets Overarching goal may be to loosen up the system so there is freedom to comment. Maybe you say it yourself, maybe use family sculpting, Link to Society: How the family interacts with the outside world When communication patterns are rigid (other than congruence) and continual, and you can't comment on that.
Symptoms are symptoms of the system
Symptoms are created through the process of interaction Low self-worth
Communication is indirect, vague, not honest
Rules are rigid and non-negotiable
Link to society is fearful, placating, and blaming Congruence (you the therapist must be congruent) (as a therapist, when you have a sense of what is going on in the room, you say it
‚ÄúRecording 20240412103404.webm‚Äù could not be found.
)
- Only with congruence can we know each other fully and we can use our differences creatively. Focus of intervention Helping people change and grow in: Communication
Beliefs about being able to grow
Restoring the use of all the senses Therapist use of self is key (as with all experiential models) To alleviate symptoms you have to intervene in the process in a way that won't replicate their process. Conditions for Chage Trust
Development of awareness
Development of understanding
Development of awareness of options
Practice Universal goal for all families Development of self-worth
Freedom to comment Techniques should emerge from the therapist/client interaction. Techniques are only useful in a context of trust. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/8.-experiential-family-therapy/8.-experiential-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/8.

Earned merit and due consideration = balance Not neutral Multidirected Partiality Not being neutral, being multidirectedly partial that you acknowledge each person's perspective and saying 'I get it. I understand why you may think that way.' You want the couples to learn how to validate someone else's perspective. Not agreeing with it, but just expanding the ability for a person to have compassion for others. Getting couples to ask for what You have been with me long enough you should know. Opening up of relational issues. People cannot be in a relationship and give nothing. Keep looking for their contribution. Want couples to validate each other and themselves. As people acknowledge that other people make contributions (due consideration), we feel that we are getting the due consideration. For couples therapy - considering Transitional
Nonjudgmental
Facilitating - 'sowing seeds and opening doors' and giving moratorium But - therapy still can be 'short-term' Avoids becoming parentified

Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) attempts to improve Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT) by incorporating an emphasis on promoting acceptance into TBCTs emphasis on behavioral change. This study examined changes in couples' communication over the course of IBCT and TBCT. Early, middle, and late sessions were coded to measure couples' communication of acceptance. Results showed that IBCT couples expressed more nonblaming descriptions of problems and more soft emotions than TBCT couples during late stages of therapy. IBCT couples significantly increased their nonblaming description of problems and significantly decreased their expressions of hard emotions and their problematic communication over time. Results support the hypothesis that structural differences between the therapies affect initial levels of emotional expression in session. Increases in nonblaming descriptions of problems were significantly correlated with increases in marital satisfaction.

"We may feel secure enough to explore if we can predict that support will be readily available if and when it is needed, especially if new ventures run into trouble or if potentially dangerous situations arise. Difficulties that lead to consultations with a family therapist often arise out of conflict within the family's own relationships."
"The family script can provide routines for family life which can be followed almost automatically."
"Repetition becomes the background against which change is the foreground, that which is new becomes the focus of attention. In contrast, chaos obscures potentially significant change, unless the new behavior facilitates consistency, in which case that new patter becomes the foreground, thus becoming the new center of attention."
"Rewriting family scripts follows the sequence of a scripted pattern giving way to some improvisation followed by the establishment of a new pattern."
"Family scripts can be defined as the family's shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts." The term 'expectations' implies anticipation of what is to be said and done within family relationships, as well as family pressures to perform the roles as expected. If one member fails to perform in the prescribed way, another member of the family may be recruited to take up that role instead. The plot is 'scripted' while the cast can change. Family scripts are revealed when repeating patterns of family interaction are either observed or described.
Family Scenario: An encounter of which it can be said that something significant happens within family relationships. Basic elements of family scenario: Context Families engaging with each other around a particular task or situation Plot Family members 'motives' become clear as the scenario unfolds Outcome The consequences of the encounter are revealed The expected scenarios for each particular family situation thread together to create an overall script for how all family relationships are expected to be conducted in general. "Problem Scenarios": Instead called 'Attempted Solution Scenarios' This helps us to focus attention on how each person tries to solve the problem. The behavior that is experienced now as problematic may have started out as an attempted solution to an earlier problem. The co-constructed story may then become part of the family beliefs about what to expect of itself. Improvising implies abandoning the set script and extemporizing instead. This may happen when the old script does not fit the current situation, or when those involved are in sear of something different.
The therapist can help to create a new co-constructed scenario by suggesting a goal which the family then achieves in their own way. Suggest a scenario in which it becomes necessary for the family to improvise. (in two parent families, the parents should devise a strategy together)
Try to block each move that has not worked in the past. Unraveling some of the origins of the scripted scenarios frees families to explore new pathways. Work on the present and the past can reinforce each other. Replicated Scripts Parents with their own individual scenarios from childhood that are repeated Corrective Scripts Choice of the opposite style of parenting Improvised scripts Corrective scripts repeated over time The therapist's background also plays a part in shaping scenarios in therapy. Positive Labeling Can be given to replicative scrips by labeling them as being loyal to the family of origin. Corrective scripts can be given a positive frame by pointing out to parents that they are struggling to provide a better experience for their children than their parents were able to provide for them. Improvised scripts (unlike the historical replicative and corrective scripts) are written in response to current situations. They are improvised either out of necessity or driven by curiosity and a wish to explore new ways of relating. A stimulus for improvisation is a degree of uncertainty about what to do next so that interaction must be played off the cuff. Positive comments can be made about how much the family is exploring unknown territory. Attachment behavior The behavior of a person seeking proximity to his or her attachment figure in a potentially dangerous situation. (This is a mechanism that protects children - or adults - when vulnerable)
The child uses the parent as a safe base from which to explore, and parent and child stay in contact to ensure that they can get together in the presence of any potential danger. In terms of script theory a potentially threatening situation evokes tightly scripted behavior in which parent and child predictably got together. Exploration allows for more improvisation. The therapist can become a temporary attachment figure to the family. The therapist must be aware of the factors that threaten the family's relationship. Any new behavior of uncertain origin emerging in a relationship (e.g., unexplained impatience) might be seen as either strange and treated as potentially dangerous, or novel and will arouse curiosity. If it is perceived as strange, attempts may be made to avoid reprovoking the impatience, returning to old familiar ways instead. If the impatience arouses curiosity, then it will probably lead to trying to discover what it is all about, and to improvise ways of dealing with it. If it becomes clear that the impatience poses a problem and something has to be done about it, new solutions may be improvised out of the necessity to sort things out. There are two main forms of improvisation in family relationships: Improvisation that comes out of necessity (Something has to be done when old solutions are not working)
Improvisation out of curiosity when it feels safe to try something new, even if it is uncertain where it will lead. A therapist who is trusted by the family can make the risks involved in improvisation feel less frightening, even when family relationships are insecure. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/4.-psychoanalytic-models-of-family-therapy/@byng-hallrewritingfamilyscripts1995.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/4.

They are concerned about the present, and how the problem is being reinforced. Symptoms: Although they are reluctant to do so, Behavioral Therapists have delineated what distinguishes a 'healthy family' and a 'dysfunctional family' (pg. 69-74 and 97-104 in FT Handbook chapters) Mutually shared goals and expectations. Support for the stresses associated with the expected transitional life stages, and other stressful life events.

The ability to change when necessary The goal of treatment is to change the problem behavior by changing the consequences of it, or the contingencies of it. Techniques
Use of Self <br><a data-href="Parent Training" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parent Training</a>: Intervention begins with an assessment of the target child's behavior. The goal of the assessment is to get a baseline of the behavior so that you can quantify change. Functional Analysis of Behavior: Once the problem behavior is identified, then the antecedents and consequences surrounding the behavior are explored. (stimuli, organismic variables, target behavior/response, consequences, contingencies).
Report the assessment to the family. Intervene in the pattern. Step 1: Induction (teach the lingo)
Step 2: Demonstration (show them how it works)
Step 3: Implementation (contingency contracts, time-out, star charts, marble game, etc.) Generalization: The goal is that this training will be generalized to other behaviors, but booster sessions are also helpful. Alexander and Parsons (1982) created for troubled adolescents and their families. Incorporates cognitive aspects and takes a more systemic approach, while the goal is behavioral change. Integrates three perspectives: Ecological
Learning Theory
Cognitive
Two Phases of Treatment Therapy: Designed to modify attitudes, assumptions, expectations, labels and emotions of the family. The major focus is to relabel (reframe) the problem behavior into something positive. Education: Help family behave differently in conjunction with reattributions. Resistance to treatment is considered an impediment to change. It is a natural consequence of the inappropriate application of technology and failure of the clinician to understand the meaning of the behavior. Functional Family Therapy relabels behaviors to reduce resistance and to motivate change by providing reattributions for the causes of family members' behaviors. Change in meaning is a necessary precursor to behavior change. The relabeling (reframe, positive connotation, etc.) operates at three levels: Interactional Level: Benign description of the interpersonal impact of the behavior (distance regulation) Motivational Level: Recasts the motive for the behavior in a benign light. Systemic Level: Emphasizes the similarities between people, a family theme. If the reframe works it interrupts automatic processing, interrupts the behaviors that follow from this processing, and thus, changes the contingencies around the problem behavior. Functional Family Therapy emphasizes paying attention to the interpersonal functions of behaviors: Functions: A person's pattern of behaviors, feelings, and thoughts mediate amounts of psychological relatedness in a relationship with another person (distance regulation)
The expression of the function can be labeled good, bad, or neutral, the function itself is not judged. These functions are properties of relationships not traits. Linear Thinking: Cognitive processes need to be incorporated, although some would argue that they were never eliminated in the first place (i.e. cognition is a behavior). Meanings of behaviors, attribution processes, belief sets, automatic thinking can get in the way of contingency change. Unit of analysis tends to be the dyad: Behavior therapists have moved toward more contextual assessments, but each move out focuses on the one to one relationship rather than the system as a whole. Dependency on the therapist? Therapist teaches the model. Based on postivism Not postmodern, it is modern. Politics of behavioral couple therapy, acceptance. <br>Same process as parent training. Assessment is always first. <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a> viewpoint. Could include couple discussing an issue in the room, with therapist observing communication patterns. Also includes evaluating the relationship itself (pg. 106-107). Strengths
Major complaints
Sex life (affection)
Future goals
Alternatives to the relationship
Individual functioning of each spouse Intervention: Once assessment is complete you set goals with the clients, focusing on one problem (well defined) at a time, this comes in the form of a contract. Major Goals: Increase positive control while decreasing aversive control. Improve communication, which should facilitate future problem solving. Interventions: Active listening with behavioral descriptions of the problem
Teach new behavior exchanges
Encourage couple to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and decision making. Teach strategies for future problem solving Techniques: Caring Days Make a list of what your partner could do to make you feel cared for. The partner does not need to do anything in return. Do not include sex as it can be seen as coercion. Quid Pro Quo Contracts Not very common because we get into the standstill of 'they have to do it first' Good Faith Contracts Both partners engage in those behaviors whether their partner does or does not. Politics and Power Politics of Behavioral Couple Therapy (i.e. Jacobson) Jacobson saw the issue with classic BMT as a problem with power, who gets to say what needs to change?
IBCT was developed from these concerns, the focus shifted to acceptance and forgiveness. IBCT Deep Analysis: D Key differences between partners in personality, interests, goals, etc. E Emotional sensitivities or vulnerabilities that each partner brings to the relationship (create a vicious cycle) E External circumstances (i.e., stressful circumstances which could exacerbate the problems created by differences and vulnerabilities) P Patterns of interaction that couples get into as they try to navigate what comes from DEE above. Intervention based on the idea that all relationship problems result from the combination of a triggering action or inaction and a sensitive reaction. They suggest that relationship problems can be resolved by altering the triggering action and the vulnerable response (emotional acceptance).
Empirical support for the model in both clinical trials and efficacy research. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/3.-behavioral-family-therapy/3.-behavioral-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/3.

Psychoanalytic Models of Family Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Most psychoanalytic models are based on Freud's idea around the identity, ego and super ego, or the development of self. For Freud the drives were sexual (in terms of possession and control), for newer psychoanalytic ideas the drives are more around connection and validation of the self (good or bad).
Object Relations Theory in some ways provides a bridge between psychodynamic theory and systems theory. We relate to people in the present based on expectations formed by early experience. Normal Development (?) Early development is based on attachment theory/separation-individuation constructs. Infant is born ready to be in a reciprocal relationship. This is activated by relating to a parent, by being loved and loving. Stages of development based on object relations: internal object (mental image of self and other, and self in relation to other). Objectless (primary narcissism/autistic) there is no other, only self. The following stages focus on the development of self through relations with internal and external objects: first the actual interactions and then the unconscious residue of the interactions. As humans, we exist in the context of relationships not as single units: There is no self without an object, there is no object without a self. Infants develop in a context of concentric 'holding environments.' As infants internalize the guarding, protecting, soothing and nurture of this 'holding environment' they begin to form a self (even if the environment is inadequate).
These early experiences then form our 'unconscious' drives for connection or separation. 'Real' others are 'used' to satisfy those drives, and we find others to validate our sense of self (good or bad). Health: achieving and preserving psychic wholeness through good object relations, integrating our 'unconscious' with our consciousness. Self and its relationships with others rest on and are expressed by the degree to which relations between the self and object are gratifying (but some theorists would suggest that since we are so narcissistic in the beginning, the relationships with others are never gratifying enough. Is it possible to be healthy?) Fairbairn suggest that as we internalize objects we are inevitably disappointed by them, in order to defend against this pain, we do the follow: We split off those aspects that are too painful to be tolerated.
Repress these intolerable aspects. This modifies the ego. Pathology occurs when some aspects of the repressed self-object system are excessively repressed, leaving the central self depleted with an impoverished relationship to the 'ideal object.'
Other forms of pathology occur when the central self system is taken over by one of the usual repressed systems, such as those whose relations are characterized by continual patterns of distance and rage with the apparent disappearance of reality. Fear-dictated flight from early object relations is also considered the deepest root of psychological problems. Skynner (1981) Diffuse boundaries
Unclear identities
Satisfaction from fantasy as opposed to reality
Difficulty coping with separation and loss
Attempts to preserve past states of relationships
Attempts to manipulate others into rigidly held views of them The major goal of Object Relations Theory is to free family members of unconscious restrictions so that they will be able to interact with one another as whole, healthy persons on the basis of current realities rather than unconscious images. The encounter between the therapist and client is the intervention. The relationship is the crucible for change and growth. The therapeutic process is the same as 'normal development' during infancy. The therapist provides the holding environment, contains/introjects the clients' emotions, resolves them, understands them, somehow makes them acceptable, and then the client introjects the resolution of the emotions. Therapist projects back a 'corrective experience.'
Self of therapist is key: Transference and counter-transference are the keystones of any psychoanalytic therapy, meaning the therapist must constantly be aware of who they are' for the client, and who the client is for them. Change occurs through insight and working through. Techniques: Listening
Empathy
Interpretation and maintaining neutrality with respect to what or how things change Big Picture (how families operate/develop): He uses attachment theory as a base. Early attachment relationships create 'working models' of how relationships are supposed to be, they create 'scripts.' as people interact with each other to become a family, they create their own 'family script' based on these early 'working models.' families have attachment patterns that are full of meanings about abandonment, engulfment, intrusion, etc. (i.e., distance regulation)
These scripts provide routines for family life which can be followed automatically. They are shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.
These scripts may be carried out from generation to generation in one form or another. Some use replicative scripts (repeat what has happened in the past), while others use corrective scripts (trying not to repeat scripts from the family of origin). There is a constant tension between these two. Healthy vs. Dysfunctional families Healthy families have scripts that provide a set of roles with which each member can identify and which provides room for improvisation when facing new situations. These scripts promote interactional awareness: Consequences of interaction
Self-awareness (why you are acting in a particular way)
Empathic awareness (why others are acting in particular ways)
Understanding the meaning of the interaction
Shared coherent perception of what is happening Symptoms occur when there is difficulty updating scripts. They may occur because the script necessary remains someone or something too painful to relive. Intolerable information is blocked or edited both intraphysically and interpersonally (secrets)\
Symptoms may also occur when a family script is used to prevent what members may fear to be an even worse disaster. Even though the current script is painful, it is rigidly clung to (the solution has become to problem) Major goal is improvisation (flexibility). In order to create an environment safe enough to explore options however, the therapist must provide a secure base from which to explore. Paradoxically, scripts, although repetitive, provide the background against which change can occur. Attachment notions Secure
Curious
Improvisation
Uncertainty
Insecure
Avoid strangeness
Stick with the familiar Instead of conflict in the family arising out of one person's pathology which extends to influence another's behavior, family scripts are encoded in all family members' minds, but each family member plays a particular role. Therefore, each member of the family can be taught to see how their role contributes to the problem, rather than asking the 'sick one' to reown the bad object and working through these issues. Reduce strategies that undermine problem-solving abilities (i.e., triangulating, scapegoating, etc.)
Reduce strategies that undermine security (threats about leaving, control, etc.)
Move toward collaboration rather than coercion and blame. Re-edit scripts so the roles are fillable by the individuals in the family. Move closer to an ideal script in which a wide scope of improvising is possible. Develop a hopeful script. Promote ownership of family's success, attributable to them not you as the therapist. This is still important for the therapist to attend to. The therapist needs to contain the family's emotions in a way so as not to become another player in their script. Therapists own scripts can also be replayed, thus it is essential that the therapist understand their own family script. Byng-Hall outlines methods for staying out of the script and for containing emotional impact: Staying out: Use teams, get supervision, have a clear plan, use circular questioning
Containing: Reflecting on the process, seeing emotions as valuable information, differentiating your script from the family's, share your emotional experience with the family. Absolves people of responsibility for their behavior (it is my mother's fault)
Lack of empirical testing
Tautological thinking: Make an interpretation, it is rejected, patient is resistant, you must be onto something. Perspective is individualist or dyadic without revision. Deterministic, linear thinking (it is my mother's fault)
Blaming the victim (you put yourself in this situation, because of what your mother did)
Mother blaming
Long process

Introduction]]></title><description><![CDATA[
In many contexts, the term 'couple' has replaced 'marriage' because of its emphasis on the bond between family members/individuals. This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage). Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)
With respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).
While the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible). Psychiatrists are physicians whoo specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health and emotional problems. (M.D. needed)
Psychologist study the human mind and behavior. (Masters needed)
Social Workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve problems. (Bachelors degree needed, unless clinical social work which needs a masters level degree)
Counselors assist people with personal, family, educational, mental health, and career decisions and problems. (Masters needed)

Inter Social Work Case management A family's patterns of behaviors influences the individual and therefore may need to be a part of the treatment plan. In CFT, the unit of treatment isn't just the person - even if only one person is 'the client'; it is the set of relationships in which the person is embedded.

MFTs treat a wide range of serious clinical problems including: Depression
Relationship issues
Anxiety
Biopsychosocial-rooted problems Research has shown that CFT is as effective or more effective than standard individual treatments for many mental health problems including: Schizophrenia
Affective Mood Disorder
Substance (Ab)use
Child Conduct Disorder
Anorexia
Autism
Chronic Illness
Couple/Partner Distress Psychiatry raised concern about scope of practice Wanted to keep MFTs from diagnosis Psychology sought amendments to the scope to place restrictions on psychological testing, and some oppose licensure in general. Social Work concerned with title restriction Wanted to call its members MFTs Counselors (ACA) historically most active opponents Opposed MFT licensure all together
Labeled the discipline as a subspecialty of counseling Professionals from many different disciplines may at times utilize family-based interventions, or work from theories or models that are core to the CFT discipline. Does that mean they are CFTs? Profession vs. Practice AAMFT's response 'It's not our intent to define the standards or the scope of practice of any other discipline - social work or psychology, for example, by saying what services they can perform or what training is need to perform those series. "We assume those professions will be diligent in ensuring that their practitioners will only deliver services for which they have had training, and are competent to perform, and that the regulatory boards for those professions will police those who go beyond their competence."

Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son. Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. Family members have a long history and a future together. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).
We need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems. Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts) For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

The goal of therapy shifted from interrupting problematic patterns of interaction to helping clients find new perspective on their lives. When they said reality was constructed, they meant socially constructed. Interpretations are shaped by our context. Interpretation of our experience mediates behavior. Social constructionists place more emphasis on the intersubjective influence of language and culture. Therapy becomes a process of deconstruction, freeing clients from the tyranny of entrenched beliefs. Inherent in most forms of therapy is the idea that before you can solve a problem, you must figure out what is wrong. But solution-focused turns this assumption on its head. The best way to solve problems is to discover what people do when they are not having the problem. Exceptions to a complaint.

The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. Structure became the target of change. Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems.

Process/Content Focus on the process of communication (how people talk), rather than the context (what they talk about) The goal is to get an overview of the presenting problem and arrange to meet. Listen to the description of the problem and identify all members of the family, household, and others who might be involved. Establish connection and engagement. Ask how the problem is affecting other members of the family. You'd like to hear from everyone, at least initially, in order to get as much information as possible. Reminder calls help increase likelihood of attendance. Build alliance with the family. Develop hypothesis about what is maintaining the presenting problem.
Establish rapport.
Gather information.
Introduce yourself.
Orient the family to the therapy room (physical or virtual) and the format of sessions. Invite family members to speak one at a time. Give everyone a chance to be heard.

What were your reactions to coming in? Take a family history. Conduct the genogram to diagram the family network. Listen for family life cycle transitions. Search for strengths and resilience. Remain curious and respectful. Explore the process of family interaction by asking questions about how family members relate to one another and inviting them to discuss their problems with one another in session. What is keeping the family stuck?
Share recommendations for treatment. What is maintaining the problem?
Maintain therapeutic alliance. Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?
Challenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. Listen to people's feelings. Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. Step back and observe. When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. Stay calm: You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. Be curious. Display empathy and respect. Review the therapeutic relationship. Say goodbye. Reinforce progress. Review what the family has accomplished. Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges.

Be aware of mandated reporting. General Practitioner What is your scope of practice? Specialist Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems? Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. All behavior makes sense in context. No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. Family therapists work to see the big picture. Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. Share the following assumptions: A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. Systems theory Systems metaphor
A family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. Social constructionist Textual metaphor
People narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. Skeptical of objective reality.
Reality is constructed. Reality is constructed through language. Reality is negotiated through relationships. Shared meanings coordinate social action. Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. Therapist assumes expert role. Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. Humans are essentially good. All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).
A supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. <br>Examples such as <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication.

No one individual controls behavior in a system and therefore no one individual can be blamed for problems in the family. Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).
If the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

Rating/Scaling (1 to 10)
Break
After intermission, the therapist will give the client/family compliments, sometimes followed by a suggestion or homework. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Once you know what works, do more of it. If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).
Focus is on solutions, on what works for clients. Respect clients own resources. Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. Future-oriented
Focusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).
The task of therapy is to do something different. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen? The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'
Solution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. What brings you in?
What are your best hopes for this meeting? Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. Changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. Problem talk: Negative
Focuses on the past
Implies permanence of problems. Clients are experts in their own lives. Clients know what they need Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?
The therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. People are resourceful. Problems are normal life-cycle complications. Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. What will you be doing instead? The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems ‚Äì effective solutions already in their repertoire.
Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.
As the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.
It is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.
Getting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.
Change perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. They begin living in the solution, not the problem. The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. Time limited
Sessions are made one at a time
One may be enough
Typical course includes 3-5 sessions
Clients can return as-needed
Often a week to a few weeks apart
Once you know more of what works, do more of it Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. What do you think the problem is now?
How will you know when the problem is solved?
How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). Asks more about perceptions than feelings. Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.
Consultant
Guardian of the conversation
Don't get bogged down in 'problem talk'
Focus on what is right
Direct clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. Focus on the 'here and now'
The future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. Assumes a position of 'not knowing.' What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
Constructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the client to assess their current level of progress toward ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/5.-solution-focused-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/5.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers. Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. Deficits in communication and problem solving. High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members) Behavior is maintained by its consequences. Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)
Good relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)
Emotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)
Understand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.

Labeling and mislabeling
Also called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of
The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. This agenda of therapy is educational: Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Identify behavioral goals
Learn techniques to achieve these goals
Facilitate social reinforcement of change Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)
Use of homework assignments
Phase out therapy gradually. Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. Booster sessions Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems: All couples run into conflict. Conflict resolution is a critical skill. Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. Families need problem solving skills Therapy includes: Clinical interview
Rating specific behaviors
Relationship satisfaction questionnaires Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making. Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Imagery

Once assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased or decreased. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing approximate behaviors. Ignoring
Rewards Identifying Automatic Thoughts Assist family members in identifying automatic thoughts
To improve the skills of identifying automatic thoughts, clients are encouraged to keep a diary to jot down situations that provoke the thoughts and the resulting emotional reactions. Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. Do not be triangulated! CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'
Blocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary Inclusion of other individuals if necessary
Medication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT
Co-therapy model is allowed
Both individual and conjoint sessions are allowed. Clients may be more likely to divulge information about their past in private sessions. CBFT therapists tell clients they will keep this information confidential, but if it might be influencing the family's current interactions, they encourage the person to share it in a joint session

For listening (p. 38)
For decision-making conversations (p. 38)
"The therapist provides the family with instruction in the use of particular behavioral skills, through didactic discussions and/or other media (e.g., readings, videos). The instruction is followed by opportunities for the family to practice behaving in the new ways." Selective Attention What each person notices about the partner and the relationship Attributions Inferences about determinants of relationship events Expectancies Predictions of what will occur in the relationship in the future Assumptions What each person believes people and relationships actually are like Standards What each person believes people and relationships should look like Socratic Questioning Understanding the underlying issues through evaluations of the logic of thinking Guided Discovery Clarify each person's standards. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of existing standards. If standards need alteration, help revise them to form new acceptable standards. Problem solve how new standards will be taken into account behaviorally. If partners standards continue to differ, discuss ability to accept differences. Normalize emotional experiences, positive and negative
Clarify thoughts, then relate these to emotions
Use questions, reflections, and interpretations to draw out primary emotions
Describe emotions through metaphors and images
Discourage attempts to distract the self from experiencing emotions
Encourage acceptance of the individual's experience by family members For example, asking one family member to recount a particular incident in detail while helping the individual enrich their expression in a way that helps the individual and the family.

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. <br>The three major concepts of structural family therapy are <a data-href="Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Structure</a>, <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a>, and <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a>s. <br><a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> (Couple; Parent; Sibling) Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers'
Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple
Parental
Child/Sibling Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.
Disengaged systems are independent, but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support. Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.
Enmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness can cripple initiative. Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. "The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system."
Disengaged or enmeshed subsystems
Hierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary
Conflict avoidance Detouring which results in a scapegoat
Cross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted) Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).
Families are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of: Normative life cycle transition The arrival of a first child
An adult child leaving home An acute stressor Natural Disaster
Unemployment Single Adult
Coupling
Having Children
Families with Young Children
Families with School-Age Children
Families with Adolescents
Divorce
Blended Families

Later Life Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. All behavior makes sense in context. The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other. <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> refers to those moments in therapy when family members interact directly with each other. <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> is not necessarily a technique. It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session. Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.
Problems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.
Activate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. Create effective hierarchy: Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).

Take-Away: Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including: Who should attend
How often
Referrals for psychiatric evaluation Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)
Map the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)
Intervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment) Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. Some problems may be treated individually. Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals. Role of the symptoms in the family

Strengths Ask questions about the presenting problem until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family. Assist family members in seeing how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. Briefly explore the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members might take to interact in more productive ways to create a shift in the family structure and help resolve the presenting problem. Greet the family

Blocking interruptions or encouraging pauses to enable less dominant persons to speak. The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. While taking sides seems like a violation of neutrality, this is done to unbalance and realign the system (note that fairness is achieved because the therapist sides with family members in turn).

(Kick) After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)
To formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. Should take into account every member. Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. Should not be explained to the family. As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. Use family's language. Use family's content. Include everyone. Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. Realize that there is no perfect reframe. Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. Blocking: Stopping usual transactions. Exaggerating: Encouraging or sustaining interactions. Silence: When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD) Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions) Therapist must be more flexible than the family. Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).

Describe 'who you are' as a therapist. How will 'who you are' as a therapist impact therapy with families?
What are your personal strengths? What are your growth areas? Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recently, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Similar to all family therapy approaches, structural family therapy is not effective in all cases. No research identifies readily observable characteristics shared by failed cases of structural family therapy. Developed to work with poor urban families, at all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and across countries. Indirect empirical support, as research on efficacy has focused on applicability to family treatment. Studies that directly test structural family therapy's efficacy in the treatment of various presenting problems and targeted populations are needed. Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'
Effectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'
Currently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches. Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'
Insufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)
Effective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models. It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works: Randomized control trials
Case studies data
Observations of therapists and clients Collecting qualitative or quantitative Remember: Research lags behind practice in family therapy. Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. Heteronormative
Pathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)
Family mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/3.-structural-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/3.

Need to check for artifacts as in random controlled trials Plus other potential biases
Other things changing, hidden 3rd variable problems. Are similar to natural experiments but often involve more researcher intervention. (Quantify what determines how to give treatment)
Regression discontinuity Does going to kindergarten shape behavioral and brain development?
Key is that the assignment variable (e.g., cutoff) is quantifiable. Instrumental variables
Matching techniques Choosing an appropriate comparison group These are not fully causal but provide better approximations than most. Most common quantitative approach in HDFS
Some things are hard/unethical to randomly assignment and not likely to occur in natural experiment design. But they are always suspect to 3rd variables (hence not causal)
How do we improve causal validity in observational designed Establish time ordering
Have a plausible mechanism
Rule out 3rd variables using covariates How do we choose 3 rd variables to rule out? The influence of attending a private school (as compared to public) on reading achievement
The influence of financial security on relationship quality Control variables need to be carefully planned out based on your research question and plausible 3rd variables. Need to be planned out in advance so that: You actually collect them
You don't fall suspect to p-hacking Use of proxies as covariates
Don't use mechanisms as covariates Statistical significance helps us rule out chance as a reason for any associations we find in our studies (random controlled trials or observational) But doesn't establish causality Confidence intervals provide more information

Correlation does not equal causation. Rule out other explanations. Make sure timing works (cause happens before effect).
Is there a plausible mechanism? Causality can only be inferred from research design. Statistical significance does not mean causality. No statistical analysis alone can lead to causal findings. Needs to be in combination with appropriate research design. Self-selection
Endogeneity Third variables
Common cause
Omitted variables Randomized Experiments/Randomized Control Trials Best causal validity (when done right)
Still have to work about equivalence and artifacts Natural Experiments/Quasi-Experiments Have exogeneity which provides some causal validity
But still have to rule out alternate explanations Observational Designs Observational = no external agent causing change like in an experiment or quasi-experiment
Are NOT causal! But we can take steps to rule out alternative explanations, which brings us closer to causal validity How do RCTs get around 3 rd variable problem? Random assignment
Ensures that charactertistics of the individuals (or families, schools, etc.) are not related to your independent variable (treatment)
So, the relationship between your treatment and your outcome (dependent variable) is not influence by 3 rd variables Randomized is the method to get causal estimates Randomization ensures that your treatment is independent from characteristics of your sample/3 rd variables but not that the treatment group and control group are equivalent In large numbers, they usually are. Need to check for statistical equivalence - also known as baseline equivalence Artifacts are issues that can arise in RCTs that may bias your results and reduce your ability to make causal statements

Random sample of elements within each selected cluster is draw
At least to stages of sampling
Really helpful for studying populations with large geographic area OR when it is easier to sample from groups (e.g., within classes instead of randomly at OSU)
When cluster sampling is used, sampling weights are also used to make sure the descriptive information of the sample will match that of the population. <br><a data-href="Stratified Random Sampling" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/stratified-random-sampling.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stratified Random Sampling</a>: To ensure that various groups are included in your sample Proportionate: Random sampling in direct proportion to groups in population Disproportionate: Proportion of each group does not match population
Pros of Disproportionate Sampling Facilitate group comparisons
Enable the study of within group processes
They still allow for population-level generalizability Why should we strive for population representative sampling Importance for policy or practice (We don't want to recommend changes that aren't based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact.) How? Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)
Work on large teams
Use secondary data How do you get a full list of your population Phone numbers
Addresses What is your population is subjective? (e.g., likely voterts, experienced trauma) - need to operationalize wel
Really hard to do for large populations with individual-level units
Easier with something like hospitals or schools
Easier to do with more targeted populations (e.g., OSU) but still confidentiality issues How do you actually reach the individuals that were randomly selected to be sampled?
Who actually is willing to participate? If participation rates are incredibly low, are our samples still representative? Who stays in our sample?
Another way that our sample can end up biased in longitudinal work Generalizability concerns (e.g., what if families experiencing poverty dropout at much higher rates)
Causal validity concerns (e.g., what is the individuals experiencing the most acute depressive symptoms are more likely to leave our study of a new therapy model?) Are design and statistical ways to reduce the impact of this problem but still needs to be avoided as much as possible. You will likely work a lot with quota or convenience sampling in your quantitative work. That's okay but: Recognize the limits of your works generalizability
Think about the balance across types of validity
See if there are representative samples available to use to answer your questions Pair multiple datasets (e.g., a representative secondary dataset with less great measurement with a datasetr you collect with great measurement)
What do we learn across studies? Again, the goal is to do valid, high quality research and to be transparent about how the strengths and limitations of our work shape its contributions to our knowledge and understanding of the world. Aim for the best sampling plan, but recognize it may not happen immediately. Putting your sampling plan into a pre-registration that details your target population (even if not random sampling), planned sample size, and strategies for recruitment helps you establish a solid plan. Talk to others who do similar research. How do they find participants? WEIRD
Diversifying our samples is not enough; we need to think critically about how our work (and our methods) acknowledge/incorporate/ignore systems of power and oppression in the world Placing onus on individuals or groups rather than structures and environment
Moving beyond disparities to what creates these disparities
Thinking about strengths-based approaches Should we control for things like race, gender identity, immigration status? Within-group analyses ideal
Using moderation to understand key processes also ideal
When not available, controlling for these things is another option, but need to think through and justify why or why not What is structural racism? Moving beyond the individual
Policies, lived environments, etc. Individuals hold multiple identities
Commonly examined in qualitative work, but important for quantitative research as well
Key principle: Cannot simply add up the experiences of multiple marginalized identities - need to understand the complex ways in which multiple identities shape experiences Between Group Default comparison group
Inability to look at how processes vary across groups
Assume homogeneity Within Group Highlight unique processes within groups
Allow for examination of heterogeneity within a population Measurement invariance Do measures operate in the same way for different groups of people? Easy to test statistically in a latent framework Do items hang together the same way? (reliability)
Does the measure have the same construct and discriminant validity? If we don't ensure our measures are appropriate for the participants we are studying, we are not going to get closer to truths about the world. Understand that your own bias shapes the question
How would answering that question enhance children's lives?
The potential solution (s) Problem focused
What is missing that we must go find?
Leads to depression, dysfunction, and learned helplessness Opportunity focused
What is present that can be leveraged and build on?
Leads to innovation and meeting the needs of the community. Acknowledign your positionality Researcher
Other identities Building relationships with organizations, community laders, and community members
Identifying your sample Based on the literature about that sample
With deedback from community members
Attending to any comparisons within your sample and how you will provide context for them Ensuring sample is not confounded by race/income If it is, generalize your findings specifically to the sample study is drawn from Ensuring sample is representative of the communities being studies
Ensuring that pan-ethic and racial groups effect the heterogeneity If they do not, address this when discussing your work. Research measures should accurately and truthfully capture your data of interest
Use of inappropriate measures can lead to biased findings Leading to deficit framing of your population Do not be race 'mute' or 'blind' when choosing measures Interrogate race when identifying what to measure and how to measure it Measures should yield equitable data for BIPOC participants
Do your measures allow for your sample's BIPOC, strengths to be highlighted? If no, you need to re-assess your measurement choice Reliable and valid for your population Culturally relevant What do you do when the measures for your variables of interest do not have reliability or validity estimates for your population? Identify multiple forms of measure ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-methods/lecture/6.-studying-diverse-populations.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Research Methods/Lecture/6.

Two course principles that come through today: Think deeply and early about all decisions you make in your research.
Be transparent about decisions you make and practices you use. What is ethical?
What approvals do I need to get?
Avoiding harm: Stress and mental health risk is a key potential harm in HDFS research. But other things too - job performance, etc. Avoid undue intrusion Only ask what is necessary (Example: immigration status) Harm threshold: only amount of stress the participant would experience in day to day life. Informed consent for minors (under 18): Parents consent, minors assent
Parents provide written consent
Minors can choose not to participate even if their parents consent (e.g., babies in a lab)
Has to actually inform (thorough, readable, understandable)
Has to be voluntary Power issues Student research? Voluntary throughout the study
Only applies to activities covered in the signed consent form Consent should be in writing unless you have a waiver. Online surveys; phone surveys Exceptions to informed consent for active research are rare. Misrepresentation or deception Avoid as much as possible
Examples of acceptable or unacceptable deception
When is it acceptable? Justified (necessary to get valid answers)
Low risk
Provides debriefing Maintaining confidentiality Changing more than names
Who is around when data is being collected Just participating can breach confidentiality depending on study inclusion criteria Securing data Always stay up-to-date on current procedures
Always immediately de-identify and sexurely store key Buck-IRB Ohio State's Institutional Review Board Training CITI <a data-href="CITI Training (2023)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/training/citi-training-(2023).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CITI Training (2023)</a>

Knowing what to submit (transparency): Look at other examples
Use their templates (e.g., informed consent forms)
Ask them questions (but ask your colleagues first)

Go through peer review at a journal.
A place for you to lay out your methodological approach prior to collecting and analyzing data (quantitative or qualitative).
Your methods may be changed (and strengthened through the first stage of review). But this also ensures acceptance as long as the project is completed as described, regardless of results. Uploaded and stored (typically publicly), but not typically reviewed. A place for you to lay out your methodological approach prior to collecting and analyzing data (quantitative or qualitative).
When submitting to a journal after getting results, being able to cite your own pre-registration is useful and looked upon positively. Research Questions
Justification for Questions (Including a Literature Review)
Detailed Methods and Analysis Plans Look at journals
Look at registries for pre-registrations: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Https:/osf.io/registries" target="_self">Https://osf.io/registries</a> Essentially the introduction and methods section of a journal article
Lots of details Deciding these things up front leads to better science (reduces the temptation to make decisions that are easy, like stopping data collection early, or likely to give significant findings). Allows outsiders to see your intentions
Guides the design of your methods Specificity is key. Without it, your intentions remain unknown and you cannot design a quality study. Don't jump to methods too quickly. Proof
Originality
Relevance
Ethical
Personal (Not necessary) Aims (broad)
Research Questions (specific)
Hypotheses (not always)
Outcomes (expected contribution to knowledge) Contributes to existing knowledge Contribution doesn't have to be huge
Replication is a contribution Being able to express relevance clearly and in non-exaggerated terms is a critical research skill. Use the current literature (and the real world) to demonstrate relevance. Literature review is an analysis, not a summary. Use it to: Show what you are building off of
Show what you are adding Filling a gap is not enough justification Can you do it? Can you do it well? Can you do it in a timely manner?
Money
Time
Your time is your most important resource. Do not take on a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances). Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic More efficient time use (e.g., read similar literature)
Looks good when others are evaluating your CV This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. And for your Registered Reports/Pre-Registrations
Hook the reader in. 2-3 paragraph formula Explain the larger context that this study will inform. Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. Flows directly from the earlier points. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. State the basic aims/hypotheses/questions and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths). Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph. That could be theoretically, it could be in terms of policy, it could be in terms of filling holes, etc. This is hard. It can be combined with paragraph 2 Your questions for your Registered Report have to have purpose, relevance, and feasibility. If qualitative, consider these your 'initial questions.'
Either way, they need enough specificity to guide your research plan. We often have an overarching aim/question or two and then questions that build on them. 2-4 research questions are most common. Either edit the questions you have already prepared or developed new questions for your registered report. Discuss your questions (and their purpose, relevance, and feasibility) with your partner. As a partner, think about the logic and organization of the outline. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-methods/lecture/2.-developing-research-questions-and-pre-registration.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Research Methods/Lecture/2.

Three reasons you should care about data management: Federal funders are moving to requiring a data management plan
You need to share your data when the grant is over You'll need a plan that will have your data ready to share publicly by the time you're done. Science is more interesting when it's true: Data management makes your data and your conclusions more accurate. Some researchers are very uncomfortable with data sharing. They make 3 basic arguments: It was my idea to collect these data. I did all the work
It's against the ethos of science This will be required for federal grants: Data should be owned by the public that funded it
Allows data to have a wider reach
Makes sharing with other authors easier
Keeps data archived and accessible long-term The Inter-University consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
Lots of resouirces on how to share
Good confidentiality and maintenance policies
OSU already pays for a site license so it is free Where you're going is dependent on collecting good information.
Important to have analyses in mind when choosing what to collect
Be thoughtful of how you present and word questions to your participants. Make sure your instructions are clear. One of the first things you have to do is select measures. You can't answer a question you haven't measured on your participants. It is important to select ones that reliably and validly measure what you want to know. Document everything. It is hard to remember what you measured, when you measured it, or why you measured it. Your best defense is well documented protocols, a good codebook, documentation of what all of your variable names mean. Key to success with any project is writing things down. Future you won't remember what current you decides to do today, or why you decided to do it. Protocols are written documentation of the decisions you make when designing your data collection. They are living documents that should be continuously updated. They have two important points: The decision made Document who made the decision and when
The decision is a rule to be implemented across the project A rationale for why the decision was made. Think about someone else using your data later, and what they will need to know. Every project has at least two investigators: You
Future you Inclusionary criteria for participants
Recruitment procedures
Assessment administration
Training of project staff
Communication with participants
ID schemes
Protocol Example: Can convey lots of information (but doesn't have to)
Most important thing is that you make a rule and don't change
Once a participant has an ID don't change
Don't change it
We always have a protocol for: What an ID looks like
When an ID gets assigned
<img alt="Dataset ID Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/dataset-id-example.png" target="_self"> The shortened digital representation of each variable in your dataset Column names Important that all variable names are unique
Variable names follow a rule: Develop a naming convention for yourself
Be consistent across datasets (and projects if possible)
For item level data, always put the number of the item LAST. Global variable naming protocol: XXXX#YYY or PPVT1001 X: Short Survey / Scale
#: Timepoint
Y: Unique Identifier You can make your own rule, but make sure you document them. Don't change them. A codebook is a key translating what you give participants into the data you store. Necessary to link between the items given and the variables in your database. Makes interpretation and analysis easier later. Variable values follow similar rules
Keep them consistent across your project
Document them in the codebook
Think about someone else using your data later, and what they will need to know. Hack: If you have a dichotomous variables, don't name it after the construct.
Name it after a category, such that 1 = yes or has that attribute. For the question: Is your house green or red? (Bad: 'HouseColor'; Good: 'HouseGreen') With multiple response questions, make sure the order of options makes sense. (Bad: '-20k, 10k, &lt;10k, &gt;20k'; Better: -&lt;10k, 10k, 20k, &gt;20k) Tracking your participants (master list, consort, change form)
Tracking data collection (on the fly messiness, scheduled and completing data) A master list is a list of every person the project touches. You may have a sub-master-list, which contains only those participants who you have assigned an ID. How do you determine who gets an ID?
You make a decision and you write it down and you don't change it. The master list is a living document from which nothing should ever be deleted
Contains basic demographic and contact information
This is the lifeblood of the project - how you determine who needs to be assessed and when
All information in the master file needs to be stored as letters or numbers Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials

Keeping track of movement of participants is important. You can keep track of this in multiple ways: The Master List
A separate excel log
A form or digital form Backing up your data is one of the most essential steps in data processing. This may mean scanning or copying paper data or a more sophisticated digital system. Try to make sure that your department/university has a file server. Shared drive Allow for multiple computers to access the same datafiles. Easier to set back-ups. Every data set has some problems. If you don't think you have data problem, then you haven't looked at it yet. Data needs to be cleaned to be used meaningfully. Be flexible because data cleaning is hard. Avoid manually-entered questions. Create an organizational system for the data files. Create a system for tracking issues and resolutions (codebook/protocol)
Ensure variables and values match those in the codebook
Run descriptives on key variables/calculated scores
Do the means make sense across ages/grades/timepoints?
Eyeball the data
Compare actual data capture to data in database

Year: 2010 ISBN: 978-0-335-23381-6 Keywords: In Progress (Denscombe, 2010, p. 17)‚Äúthe purpose of the research is something that needs to be understood concisely, precisely and right from the beginning.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)‚Äúa clear vision of the purpose of research provides a crucial basis for evaluating the research‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)‚ÄúThis allows readers to evaluate the research by providing benchmarks against which to judge the extent to which the research has been successful.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)‚Äúa clear vision of the purpose of research provides a good platform from which to conduct the investigation. This applies whether the research uses a quantitative, a qualitative, or a mixed methods approach‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)‚ÄúClarity of purpose also calls on the researcher to identify a relatively narrow and precise area for investigation rather than setting out to investigate some general area of interest. It requires the researcher to focus attention on specific aspects, specific questions, specific issues within the broader area of interest.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)‚Äúunless some quite specific topic is pinpointed, there is the very real danger that: ‚Ä¢ researchers will ‚Äòbite off more than they can chew‚Äô; ‚Ä¢ researchers will flounder in a sea of vast quantities of issues and data; ‚Ä¢ time will be wasted on the collection of unnecessary information; ‚Ä¢ time will be wasted on meanderings up blind alleys before a clear direction becomes evident; ‚Ä¢ vague questions might lead to vague answers.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)‚ÄúSocial research questions must be, in principle, testable. Explanations and theories must be open to proof or disproof‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)‚ÄúThe research should also offer something new.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)‚ÄúThe literature review is particularly important‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)‚ÄúTo offer something new or different, the research needs to build on existing knowledge and link to what is already known on a particular topic or issue.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)‚ÄúGood research avoids the pitfall of being over-ambitious in terms of its scale and its scope.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)‚Äúit is essential that the research does not set out to do something that is illegal or immoral.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)‚Äúthe project researcher should ensure that his/her activities accord with ethical standards and codes of conduct that operate for the discipline, the profession and the country in which the research is located.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)‚Äúdescriptive research, which provides detailed accounts of events or situations in order to gain a clearer picture of what is going on.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)‚Äúexplanatory research, which is mainly concerned with cause‚Äìeffect relationships. It builds on well-established theories with a view to developing them and using them to make predictions that can be tested. It aims to explain why things happen.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)‚Äúexploratory research, which investigates new areas and which seeks to generate new theories and concepts.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)‚ÄúThe rights and interests of participants and others directly affected by the research will be taken into consideration. The research will be conducted in accord with an appropriate code of research ethics. Approval will be sought from a relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. The research will be conducted in an honest, open and transparent manner ‚Äì as far as it is possible.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)‚ÄúEthics refers to the system of moral principles by which individuals can judge their actions as right or wrong, good or bad‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)‚Äúresearchers need to introduce a moral perspective to the way they design and conduct their investigations.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)‚Äúneed to consider what will be acceptable in the context of the values of the wider society in which the research is conducted‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)‚ÄúThe motivation for researchers to operate ethically should be a matter of professional integrity‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)‚Äú‚ÄòThe acceptability of social research depends increasingly on the willingness of social researchers to accord respect to their subjects and to treat them with consideration.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)‚ÄúResearch that does not do this will damage the reputation of social research‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)‚Äúwithout the good will and trust of the public large parts of social research will become starved of information.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)‚ÄúResearch‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)‚Äúmust take account of the moral and legal climate of the time and the boundaries this places on the topics of investigation that are deemed acceptable and the nature of the methods of investigation it tolerates.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)
Ground rule: Research should produce findings from which generalizations can be made. Either the research is based on a sample of people, events, or data that are representative of the wider population (generalizability).
Or sufficient information is given about the characteristics of the sample or the cases used in the research for judgements to be made about the extend to which findings can be expected to apply more widely (transferability).
Or the people, events, or data included in the research have been chosen because of their particular characteristics and the belief that these characteristics will be helpful for generating and developing theories (theory relevance). ‚ÄúA generalization involves drawing some conclusion about a whole group or category of things on the basis of information drawn from particular instances or examples. On the basis of what is found to exist in a relatively few instances or examples, propositions are made about the nature and qualities of the whole class.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 195) ‚ÄúResearchers usually wish to feel confident that their findings have been based on samples that are either representative of, or have particular characteristics that are significant for the analysis of, the broader class of thing being investigated. Another reason centers on the researcher's wish to produce generalized knowledge in the form of theories.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 195-196) ‚ÄúThe concern with generalizations relates to the way findings from specific pieces of research lend themselves to the development of propositions that work very widely ‚Äì possibly universally ‚Äì and that contribute to establishing rules or theories about the workings of social phenomena.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196) Generalizations Continue to be a crucial aspect of good research for all but a small minority of those operating under the umbrella of ‚Äòsocial research‚Äô
Can be justified in different ways depending on the nature of the particular research and its underlying assumptions
Need to be incorporated into the rationale for the research.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196) ‚Äúthe criteria for selection are the crucial starting point when it comes to generalizations.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)
‚Äúthe selection of the items to be included in the study needs to be done on a logical basis ‚Äì a basis that allows generalizations from the data to be defended as reasonable and justifiable ‚Äì and within social research there are broadly two approaches to this matter. One way is to go for a representative sample. This tends to be favored by relatively large-scale survey research using quantitative data and a positivistic approach. The alternative is to select the items for study on the basis of their particular characteristics. Smaller-scale research involving case studies, qualitative data and an interpretivist approach tend to rely on this.‚Äù (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)
Do the findings from the research apply elsewhere? Have the criteria for selection of the people, events, or data been described and justified?
Reflecting the criteria for selection, have an adequate number and appropriate diversity of people, events, or data been included in the research?
Does the description of the sample or cases used in the research allow comparisons with others of their type? Research tends to focus on a reduced number of instances of the thing under investigation. It investigates a sample or it investigates specific cases. To what extend do the findings from the sample or case apply to other instances that were not included in the study? To be representative, samples need to: Cover all relevant types
Have these types in proportion to the volumes found in the whole population A representative sample includes a balanced cross-section of all of the relevant instances. This justifies generalizing from the findings of the sample. To achieve representativeness: Use of random samples. Provided that the units included (people, observations, etc.) in the research are sufficiently large and are chosen on a genuinely random basis, the end result ought to be representative of the total population from which they were drawn. There is the selection of samples by quotas. On the basis of attributes of the population which are already known, the researcher can select samples deliberately to include all the relevant types and to cover these types in proportion to their profile in the total population. It is not always easy for researchers to obtain a sample that qualifies as 'representative' according to these strict criteria. It demands that we know relevant details about the whole population. Social researchers frequently rely on a less stringent version of representativeness in which the principle remains the same but the rigor of selection of the sample is relaxed somewhat. The principle is still that the instances used for the research allow for the findings of the research to be extrapolated to other instances not included in the research. The researcher does not claim that the sample necessarily meets all the criteria of representativeness. The claim is that the instances used for research are 'typical'. The word 'typical' carries with it some notion of being standard, of being normal, of being usual. It suggests that any findings from the sample will apply elsewhere because the instances included in the sample have no particularly unusual characteristics that mark them out from the rest. While claims to conducting research on 'typical' instances certainly retain the need to identify key features relevant to the investigation, the sample might not include all of the relevant categories. The claim to generalizability, however, persists through the emphasis on: Including the main type
Achieving some balance of the numbers in each category A case study approach is used when a researcher's focus is on a limited number of instances. Researchers can make the strategic decision to concentrate their investigation on one or a few cases in order to allow greater depth to their research, more attention to the dynamics of the situation, better insights that come from a detailed knowledge and understanding of a specific example. (Qualitative researchers favor this strategy)
Example: There is almost no chance of getting a sample that is large enough and widespread enough to satisfy the criteria for being representative, in a statistical sense, of the whole 'population.' The selection tends to rely on a more purposeful process in which examples are chosen for their particular qualities, as opposed to being chosen with no regard for their individual traits (random) or being chosen with respect to some general category (quota). There are 4 grounds on which cases might be chosen to reflect their particular qualities: Researchers can justify generalizations from their case study (or small sample) if they can establish that the instance included in the research was typical of other instances. The basis for the generalization is that whatever was found in the one instance actually studies was likely to appear in other instances because there was nothing unusual, nothing special, about the case that was investigated. Social researchers can opt to focus on instances that are anything but representative or typical. 'Extreme' instances may be selected deliberately because they have certain qualities that exaggerate the influence of a particular factor that is of interest to the researchers. Things might be visible in these circumstances simply because the situation is extreme or special, and that these might be impossible to detect in more 'watered down' instances. Things become visible here that would remain hidden under typical circumstances. (It can suggest the way things might develop if typical instances start to shift towards the special or extreme. The special/extreme example might act to alert is to factors that would otherwise have remained hidden under the typical circumstances. What was detected in the extreme instance should be looked for in the typical.) Researchers might decide to focus on instances which would appear to present a least likely scenario in terms of the theory or proposition they are investigating. Following the commitment to testing theories to destruction and challenging existing theories or suppositions through attempting to 'falsify' them, there is clear logic to choosing instances that might be expected to 'go against the grain' and prove the theory wrong. The selection of a case might reflect the fact that it constitutes an event or situation that is a special case - a one-off or extremely rare occurrence. It is almost certain that such events or situations are beyond the control of the researcher in the sense that he or she could not organize for them to happen, as in an experiment. The timing and the location of the event will be something to which the researcher responds rather than initiates. The degree to which the findings from the small number of events or cases being studies might be expected to apply elsewhere can be addressed by comparing and contrasting the nature of the specific units of study with the broader population of such units that exist. The selection of instances for research can be based on their usefulness in terms of the contrast they offer with other instances chosen to be included in the research. The researcher can deliberately set out to select examples that provide a stark contrast with one another and that represent the widest variation possible within the thing being studied. Choosing them to achieve a maximum variation allows the research to use the comparative method, controlling for key variables such as size and location, to see what other factors might appear to be linked with these. Selection on the basis of comparison can be useful: It can allow an element of 'triangulation' between alternatives. The researcher is able to see how a certain thing works in two or more very different settings. It is useful where the research design is emergent. Where the researcher selects cases as part of an unfolding path of discovery, then the idea that has emerged from the one example can be compared with the next sample, which might be consciously chosen as one that is different. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-methods/@denscombegroundrulessocial2010.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Research Methods/@denscombeGroundRulesSocial2010.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 19:19:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here is my second brain, enjoy.

Useful for nominal and ordinal variables. Report counts and/or percentages A frequency table, bar chart, or pie chart might not be meaningful to depict interval/ratio variables. More graphs and statistics are available to represent interval/ratio variables. Similar to a frequency table, but data is categorized into groups. Show both raw data and shape of distribution (like a histogram). First find range of data (Max - Min) then break into multiple groups with equal intervals. Stem: Categories

The scatterplot is useful for providing a quick indication of the nature of the relationship among variables x and y (bivariate data). Direction of the relationship (positive or negative): A positive relationship occurs when both variables are increasing. A negative (inverse) relation occurs when one variable is increasing as the other is decreasing. Can draw a straight line (aka regression line) through the data points that cuts the bivariate distribution in hald. The slope of the regression line shows the direction of relationship.
Alternatively, split the chart into 4 equal sections (quadrants) and examine how data points are spread across the 4 quadrants. Strength of the relationship: Strong relationships: Data points tend to fall close to the regression line. Weak relationship: Data points are widely scattered around the regression line. Summary of the scales of measurement Also referred to as Demographics Table
In research, typically used to describe your sample Sex/Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Level of Education, etc. Only used to display discrete data. In SPSS: Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Frequencies -&gt; drag variable (s) of interest (VOI) into 'Variables' box -&gt; select 'Display Frequency Tables' box in bottom left-hand corner of the menu. Unfortunately, SPSS does not provide us with output that is 'APA-Ready'
In order to create an APA-style frequency (demographics) table, you need to use Excel (or similar program) When do we use them? Nominal or ordinal data (discrete data) There are two ways to produce Bar Graphs, each produces the same graph. SPSS: Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Frequencies -&gt; Charts -&gt; 'Bar Charts'
Graphs -&gt; Chart Builder -&gt; drag 'Bar' to the previewer, place variable of interest on x-axis. Note that the bars are separated by some space and do not touch one another, reflecting the nature of nominal data being discrete. When do we use them? Nominal or ordinal data (discrete data) In SPSS: Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Frequencies -&gt; Charts -&gt; 'Pie Charts'
Graphs -&gt; Chart Builder -&gt; drag 'Pie/Polar' to the previewer, place variable of interest on x-axis. When do we use them? Displaying interval and ratio data (continuous data)
Checking for the shape of the distribution Skewness, normality There are three different ways to produce histograms using SPSS, but each produces the same graph. Typically making them while producing other descriptive statistics, so that will guide which menu you use.

In SPSS, you can create new variables from old variables. In the menu bar, go to transform.
Select Compute Variable.
In the pop-up window that shows up, give a name for the new target variable.
Define your new variable in the Numeric Expression Box
Click OK Recoding variables in SPSS involves altering variable values to create a new modified variable, typically done during data preparation and analysis to better suit analysis needs or simplify the data. In the menu bar, go to Transform.
Select Recode to Different Variables. It is not recommended to Recode into Same Variables as this overwrites existing variables. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/lecture/2.-data-representation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/Educational Statistics 6641/Lecture/2.

Parameters are usually notated by Greek alphabet. Sample statistics are usually notated by English alphabet. <br>A good <a data-href="Sample" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/sample.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sample</a> should be: Identical to the characteristics/properties of the population. Representative of a population. This allows the sample to be generalizable to the population. Results will be applicable to other samples drawn from the same population. Every member of the population of interest has an equal probability of being selected. Selection of one unit has no effect on the selection of another unit. Best technique to obtain a representative sample. Use a number table, a compute, a drawing, or a lottery system to generate random numbers. Use if one or more characteristics are focal research interest. The goal is to compare groupds (strata). The purpose is to make sure each group is represented in the sample. First divide population into groups (strata). Then a random sample is taken from each group. There are 'naturally occurring' groups in population, usually geographical or organizational. Randomly selected clusters. Then sample all units within each cluster, or random sample with each chosen cluster. Error is smaller if the clusters are similar to each other. Every k^th unit is selected from a list, where k=population/desired sample size. Have a list with all units in the population. Then take sample systematically. Make sure the list you are selecting from is random. Choose samples merely based on proximity without considering whether they represent the population or not. Readily available, quick, inexpensive. <br>Can reduce bias by using conveniance sample along with <a data-href="Simple Random Sample (SRS)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/lecture/simple-random-sample-(srs).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Random Sample (SRS)</a>, taking multiple samples, or cross-validation. Is the sample representative of the population? (Are the findings generalizable?)
Sample size? The larger sample does not mean more representative of the population. Required sample size depends on design, confidence level, desired effect size and statistical power. Generally, 30 or more per combinations of factors. How to report: Define your population

Measurement: The process of assigning numbers to phenomena in order to represent or distinguish among responses. Represent the features and properties of a variable. Help us understand how to describe and analyze the data. S. S. Stevens (1951) developed 4 types of measurement scales that could be used for assigning these values: Usually used for qualitative/categorical variables
Numbers mark distinctions between responses, and nothing more. The numbers have no inherent meaning, and the order does not matter at all. Example: County of residence (1=Franklin, 2=Delaware, 3=Union OR 1=Delaware, 2=Union, 3=Franklin)
Sex assigned at birth (0=female, 1=male OR 10=female, 15=male) In SPSS, can set value labels and display either data or label. Numbers are assigned to represent ranks or order (usually discrete). Numbers have meaning, but only in terms of distinguishing order, from largest to smallest (or vice versa). Equal distance between two adjacent levels are not assumed. Example: Letter grades: A, B, C, D, E (1-5) Size of a cup of coffee (small, medium, large, 1-3)
Socioeconomic status (SES) (low, middle, high, 1-3)
Agreement (Likert Scale) (strongly agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree, 1-5) Sometimes data needs to be recorded to make interpretation more intuitive Equal intervals or increments along the scale
Interval variables have an arbitrary zero point. Example: Temperature Celsius or Fehrenheit, SAT score, credit score
Likert Scale (equal distance assumed): More choices for statistical methods are available for interval data than ordinal data. Decisions might depend on your data. Report range to help readers understand the measure. Equal intervals or increments along the scale and contains an absolute and true zero point (absence of the phenomena being measured, data measures from 0 and above).

Behavioral and social scientists describe phenomena like drug use, psychiatric distress, and academic achievement using parametric statistical models.
Common methods include analyzing Central Tendencies, Score Variations, and associations between characteristics. Behavioral and social scientists learn about phenomena by understanding how variables relate to each other. To grasp these relationships, we ask three fundamental questions: Are two variables related?
What is the direction of their relationship?
How strong is the relationship? Statistical Models = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1X1 + ùõΩ2X2 + ùõΩ3X3 Y: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Variable" data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent</a> (outcome) variable
: predicted score of Y
Y - : Error Measuring Model Error Use subscript i to indicate the subject, e.g., e1 = Y1 - 1, e2 = Y2 - 2 ...
Square each individual's error and sum them all: <br><a data-href="Sum of Squares of Error (SSE)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/sum-of-squares-of-error-(sse).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares of Error (SSE)</a>
SSE measures the model's basic error. The goal of statistical modeling is to make small changes to improve the model. Test if the new model reduces error (smaller SSE) compared to the previous model. If a more complex model predicts Y better (lower SSE), we conclude the added complexity (new predictor X) improved the model. The general linear model (GLM) is a way to simplify and combine multiple linear regression models into a single, unified format. It is not a different type of model but a more efficient way to represent them. General form: Y = XB + U
Data = Model + Error The key word is 'general.'
The GLM can be used to make predictions from various models. Depending on the outcome variable, logistic regression, ordinal regression, or count models (Poisson) may be used - these are also forms of the GLM.
Another term: Generalized Linear Models (GLIM) The GLM is actually a special case of (GLIM)! Types of Data <br><a data-href="Binary" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Binary</a>

AKA two-sample t-test, independent-samples t-test or student's t-test.
Dependent (DV): Scores being compared Measured on at least an interval level scale
Often used to compare treatment and control groups. Independent variance (IV): The group characteristics (dichotomous) Intervention vs. No intervention
Medicine vs. Placebo Typical research question: Is there a mean difference between two groups? Socioeconomic status (2 levels)
Type of therapeutic intervention (2 types) -&gt; Results of GAD-7 questionnaire over time
Genre-based approach (yes/no) -&gt; Writing skills
Exposure to community violence (yes/no) -&gt; Feelings of safety
Teaching method (2 kinds) -&gt; Students scores on the exam (TOEFL)
Type of social emotional curriculum implemented in a school (2 types) -&gt; classroom behavior, academic achievement scores
Teaching style (2 types) -&gt; reading comprehension skills of EFL middle school students
Participant or non-participant in school sport -&gt; student's cumulative grade point average. Untreated control group design with dependent pretest and posttest samples NR (Not Random) O1 X O2
NR (Not Random) O1 O2 Untreated control group design with dependent pretest and posttest samples using a double pretest NR O1 O2 X O3
NR O1 O2 O3 Untreated control group design with dependent pretest and posttest samples using switching replications NR O1 x O2 (O3) x O4
NR O1 O2 (O3) x O4 Untreated control group design dependent pretest and posttest samples using reversed-treatment control group NR O1 (pre) X O2 (post)
NR O1 (pre) X O2 (post) Nondirectional: Test if group 1 (¬µ1) is significantly different from group 2 (¬µ2) H0: ¬µ2 = ¬µ1 vs. H1: ¬µ2 ‚â† ¬µ1
Alternatively, H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 = 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â† 0
For experiment and control, usually group 1 is the experiment group. Directional: Test if group 1 (¬µ1) is significantly greater than group 2 (¬µ2): H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â§ 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &gt; 0 Test if group 1 (¬µ1) is significantly smaller than group 2 (¬µ2): H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â• 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &lt; 0 tobs = (1 - 2) √∑ (sx-bar 1 - sx-bar 2)
1 and 2 are the means for group 1 and group 2, respectively. sx-bar 1 - sx-bar 2 is the standard error of the difference between two means, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference between two means: sx-bar 1 - sx-bar 2 = spooled ‚àö(1 √∑ n1) + (1 √∑ n2)
Where spooled is the pooled standard deviation computed as spooled = ‚àö ((n1 - 1) s12 + (n2 - 1) s22) √∑ (n1 + n2 - 2) where n1 is group 1 sample size, and n2 is group 2 sample size. Recall for paired-sample t-test: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön The observed t is then compared against the critical value from the t-table to determine a statistical decision. For independent t-test, tcrit has the degrees of freedom v = n1 + n2 - 2, at a particular level of significant ùõº (usually .05), for a one- or two-tailed test. Recall rejection region is outside of tcrit (s) toward the tail(s): sample data more extreme! Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit)
Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; ùõº (SPSS output) ùõº level is usually .05 (95% confidence level) Make sure to report t, df, and p-value to support your conclusion. Nondirectional: 100 (1 - ùõº)% CI: (1 - 2) ¬± tdf, ùõº/2 x (sx-bar 1 - sx-bar 2) Recall for paired-sample t-test: 100 (1 - ùõº)% CI: ¬± tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar To test greater (treatment group is greater): 100 (1 - ùõº)% LCL: (1 - 2) - tdf, ùõº/2 x (sx-bar 1 - sx-bar 2) To test smaller (treatment group is smaller): 100 (1 - ùõº)% UCL: (1 - 2) + tdf, ùõº/2 x (sx-bar 1 - sx-bar 2) Group 1: City (n1 = 26) Mean: 55.23

Research Question: Are burritos ordered (order) in-person significantly bigger (weight) than the ones via mobile orders? Group 1: Mobile (n1 = 22)
Group 2: In-Person (n2 = 31) Since the research interest is if mobile orders are smaller, I'll treat the mobile group as experiment (group 1 in SPSS for independent t-test) and in-person as control (group 2 in SPSS for independence t-test). Don't be confused with variable coding. For the variable order, value 1 = In-Person and value 2 = Mobile (nominal coding is interchangeable) DV is usually recorded as one variable. IV is usually recorded as another variable to identify groups (dichotomous, or pick 2 groups at a time to compare).
Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Independent-Samples t-test
Move DV to Test Variable(s)
Move IV to Grouping Variable and define groups (Group 1 and Group 2) If there are treatment and control groups, group 1 is usually treatment and group 2 is control. The mean difference is group 1 minus group 2. You can refer to the descriptive statistics to confirm which group is higher. AKA homoscedasticity
When comparing means, we need the dispersion to be similar in both groups. The distortion in spread can interfere with our investigation of difference between means.
HOV assumes population variances for the two groups are equal. If design is balanced (n1 = n2), no need to worry about departure from HOV (independent t-test is robust in this case).
HOV tests are sensitive to violations of other assumptions about the data, especially normality. So there are many versions of this test: An easy way (by hand) is the F-max test (aka Hartley's F-max test).
SPSS uses Levene's HOV test for independent t-test. This is the first time we do not reject the null hypothesis. F has two degrees of freedom
H0: ùúé12 = ùúé22 vs. H0: ùúé12 ‚â† ùúé22 Or alternatively, H0: ùúé12 √∑ ùúé22 = 1 vs. H0: ùúé12 √∑ ùúé22 ‚â† 1 (whether the ratio of 2 variances equals 1) For convenience we generally put the larger variance in the numerator and smaller variance in the denominator, and the ratio follows an F-distribution: Fmax = (s2) (larger) √∑ (s2) (smaller) Fmax is compared to a critical F value. For this test, we hope to retain (cannot reject) H0 so HOV is tenable (satisfactory)! Small Fmax or big p-value are good (i.e., equal variances)! <br><img alt="8. Independent T-Test, Homogeneity of Variance.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/8.-independent-t-test,-homogeneity-of-variance.png" target="_self">
<br><img alt="Densities of F-Distributions.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/densities-of-f-distributions.png" target="_self">
The F distribution is usually used to compare variances. Since variances are always a squared value and always non-negative, the F statistic does not go below 0, and it is not symmetric. The F-statistics has two sets of degrees of freedom: Numerator (v1) and denominator (v2). The pair of degrees of freedom determine the shape of the F distribution. When comparing two groups (sample sizes n1 and n2), v1 = n1 - 1 and ), v2 = n2 -1. If F-max test, v1 (dfnum) is the degree of freedom for group with larger variance, and v2 (dfdenom) is the degree of freedom for the group with smaller variance. Reject H0 if Fmax ‚â• F (Œ±, dfnum, dfdenom) but we don't want to reject it! Fmax = 375.225 √∑ 297.065 ‚âà 1.263
Critical F (. 05, 25, 21) = 2.045
Since 1.263 &lt; 2.045, cannot reject H0
Fireworks spending for people living in the city has a variance comparable to that of in the country (HOV satisfactory)! H0: ùúé12 = ùúé22 = ... = ùúék2 vs. H1: At least 2 group variances are different (k = 2 for our purpose)
[Optional] Test statistics Fobs Total sample size n divided into k groups (j = 1, 2, ..., k); We are just comparing 2 groups (k = 2)
Sample size for each group is n1, n2, ..., nj, ..., nk
i denotes the ith subject (data point) in group j
zij = | xij - xj | is the absolute deviation from a data point to jth group mean Brown and Forsythe extended this to median or 10% trimmed mean Numerator: Between group variation (in terms of absolute deviation) Denominator: Within group variation (in terms of absolute deviation) We would reject H0 if Fobs &gt; Fk - 1, n - k (here k = 2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; .05 Since we want to find no statistically significant difference in variances between the two groups, a p ‚â• .05 (big p-value) is desired here!
We will let SPSS do Levene's HOV test for us! Just remember if we see a big p-value (p-value ‚â• .05), HOV is tenable (satisfactory). If p-value is small (p &lt; .05), HOV is violated. The Welch's t-test (aka separate variances t-test, unequal variances t-test) is usually appropriate when the population variances are unequal and the sample sizes are unequal. [Optional] tobs = unstandardized b √∑ standard error
Variance errors of the mean are computed for each group where s12 are sample variances for groups. The criteria to reject H0 are the same as independent t-test (extreme t or small p).
We'll let SPSS do Welch's t-test for us! Just remember if we see a small p-value (p &lt; .05), we can reject H0 and claim difference between the two group means is significantly different from 0 (or one-sided p-value to test greater/smaller).
Make sure to report t, df, and p-value to support your conclusion. <br><img alt="8.

First check HOV assumption: Satisfactory, F (1, 46) = 0.519, p = .475 (i.e., cannot reject H0 equal variance), so we can use independent t-test results from the first line (equal variances assumed). We are not trying to compute the observed F for Levene's Test, but the df is (k - 1, n - 2) = (1, 46). spooled = ‚àö(25 x 375.225 x 21 x 297.065) √∑ (46) = 18.4267
sx-bar 1 - x-bar 2 = 18.4267 ‚àö(1 √∑ 26) + (1 √∑ 22) = 5.3379
tobs = (-7.497) √∑ (5.3379) ‚âà -1.404
df = n1 + n2 -2 = 26 + 22 - 2 = 46
Since p-value (make sure we look at results from the first line) is quite large (p = .167), we cannot reject H0 -&gt; Spending on fireworks did not differ significantly between people living in the city (M = 55.23, SD = 19.371) and the country (M = 62.73, SD = 17.236), t(46) = -1.404, p = .167. Notice 95% CI (-18.241, 3.248) also covers 0, agreeing with the non-significant t-test. <br><img alt="8.

First check HOV assumption. Violated, F (1, 51) = 9.594, p = .003 (i.e., reject H0 equal variance), so we are using the results (Welch's t-test aka separate variances t-test) from the second line (equal variances not assumed). For Welch's t-test, it is difficult to calculate the degree of freedom (50.061) by hand. A one-tailed t-test was conducted (if mobile orders are significantly smaller than in-person orders). Since the p-value (make sure we look at results from the second line) &lt; .05 (p = .019), we can reject H0 -&gt; Mobile-Ordered Burritos (M = 1.29, SD = 0.246) are significantly smaller than burritos ordered in-person (M = 1.48, SD = 0.403), t(50.061) = -2.136, p = .019. Notice the 95% upper confidence limit (-0.04118) is below 0, agreeing with the significant t-test results. Cohen's d = (1 - 2) √∑ spooled
Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ¬±0.2: Small effect
d = ¬±0.5: Medium effect
d = ¬±0.8: Large effect Use Cohen's d when HOV is satisfactory and sample size is large (total n at least 40 or 50) Hedges' g ‚âà (1 - 2) √∑ spooled (1 - 3 √∑ 4n - 9) Total sample size n = n1 + n2
Provides a bias correction to Cohen's d for small sample sizes
Uses Hedges' g when HOV is satisfactory and sample size is small (n &lt; 40 or 50) Glass's Delta (‚àÜ) = (1 - 2) √∑ spooled Uses only the control group's (group 2 in SPSS) standard deviation
Use Glass's delta when HOV is violated (variances significantly different between groups) Use the same convention as Cohen's d to interpret Hedge's g or Glass's delta. <br><img alt="8. Independent T-Test, Homogeneity of Variance 3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/8.-independent-t-test,-homogeneity-of-variance-3.png" target="_self">
Since HOV is satisfactory and sample size is fairly large (n = 48), it's appropriate to use Cohen's d (-0.407) and Hedges' g (-0.400) effect size measures. Both indicate small effect size. Notice the standardizer (denominator) for Cohen's d is the same as the pooled standard deviation we calculated (spooled = 18.427).
APA Style Writing Template: An independent t-test was conducted to determine if people living in the city spend differently on July 4 th fireworks compared to those in the country. Data on spending was gathered from samples of 26 city dwellers and 22 country folks. The sample mean for the city was $62.73 (SD = 17.236).

The independent t-test indicated that the spending means were not significantly different for people in the city and country, t (46) = -1.404, p = .167. We failed to reject the null hypothesis that the spending was the same between locations at the .05 level of significance. Therefore, we can conclude that location is not significant factor in determining firework spending. Cohen's d was -0.407, suggesting a small effect size. <br><img alt="8.

Since HOV is violated, we can use Glass's delta (-0.474) to measure effect size (in-person as control group), which indicates a small to medium effect size.

APA Style Writing Template We wanted to determine if burritos ordered via mobile app are significantly smaller than burritos ordered in person.

Therefore, a separate variances t-test was conducted. The t-test result was significant at the .05 confidence level, t (50.061) = -2.136, p = .019. We can conclude that mobile-ordered burritos are significantly smaller than in-person orders. Glass's delta was -0.474, suggesting a small to medium effect size. Measure or characteristic is normally distributed in each of the two populations (i.e., the two groups).
Observations are from a random sample, and the scores in each sample (people) are independent of each other. DV is measured on at least an interval level scale. HOV (homogeneity of variance): The variances in the two populations are comparable. If violated (and design is not balanced), use Welch's t-test (separate variances t-test) instead. Is vitamin C effective to treat colds? A health-researcher recruited a sample of 27 adults and followed them for a year to assess the number of colds they had in year 1. She then had them take weekly doses of vitamin C and followed them in year 2. Paired because it is a pre to post. A social studies teacher wanted to determine if the students in his school in the US have similar perceptions of world leaders compared to other countries. Where leaders are rated from 0 (worthless) to 10 (effective), the global norm on the 'World Leader Scale' is 6 with a standard deviation of 1.8. The teacher took a sample of 35 students from the school and had them fill out the same WLS. One sample z-test A counseling psychologist wanted to determine if prisoners who are depressed eat less of their meals than prisoners who are not depressed. There were 130 prisoners who volunteered for the study, and 42 of them were classified as depressed. The psychologist monitored the amount of each meal in ounces eaten by both groups for a week. Independent t-test A random sample of 39 museum visitors were questioned on how much they spend per month on cultural or arts-related events. The survey found that, on average, these visitors spent $40 per month with a standard deviation of $12. The researcher wanted to test whether the monthly expenditure for museum visitors is below $45.

Write conclusion Fred wishes to determine whether children in regular education are hurt or helped academically by the inclusion of special education students in their classes. He has gained the cooperation of the seventh-grade teachers in two similar junior high schools to participate in his study. One school recently integrated special education students into their regular classroom, while the other one has not. The teachers in both school supply Fred the students‚Äô raw scores on a standardized achievement test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year.

The result of the t-test is not significant (t = -1.167, df = 38 (n1 + n2 - 2 = 15 + 25 - 2 = 38), p = .250) at the Œ± =. 05 significance level. Therefore, we fail to reject H0 and conclude the means are equal between the two groups. The results of Levene's test is not significant (F (1,38) = .566, p = .465) at the Œ± = .05 significance level.

The test results indicate that, on average, the pretest means were not statistically significantly different for students who were not in the integrated classroom (M = 92.93, SD = 14.56) and students who were in the integrated classroom (M = 98.56, SD = 14.88); (t (38) = -1.167, p = .250, d = -. 381). The null hypothesis that the pretest means were the same for students in the integrated and not in the integrated classroom was retained at the .05 level of significance. The effect size d was -. 381. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small effect. Is there a mean difference in posttest achievement scores between regular education students who are not in integrated classroom and in the integrated classroom?

The results of the Welch's t-test is significant (t' = -2.731, df = 37.952, p = .010) at the Œ± = .05 significance level. Therefore, we reject H0 and conclude the means are not equal between the two groups. The results of Levene's test is significant (F (1,38) = 14.620, p &lt; .001) at the Œ± = .05 significance level. Therefore, we reject H0 and conclude the variances are not equal between the two groups. Write-Up: An independent samples t-test was conducted to determine if the mean post-test achievement scores of regular education students who were not in an integrated classroom differed from regular education students who were in the integrated classroom. The test results indicate that, on average, the post-test means were statistically significantly different for students who were not in the integrated classroom (M = 94.47, SD = 11.51) and students who were in the integrated classroom (M = 108.16, SD = 20.19); (t (38) = -2.731, p = .010, d = - .678). The null hypothesis that the pre-test means were the same for students in the integrated and not in the integrated classroom was retained at the .05 level of significance. The effect size d was -.678, which is interpreted as a small effect. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/labs/8.-independent-samples-t-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/Educational Statistics 6641/Labs/8.

<img alt="Midterm 2-4.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-4.png" target="_self">
Where ¬µ = group mean and k = number of groups. If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which is that there are at least two group means that are statistically significantly different from each other. The one-way ANOVA is an Omnibus test statistic, and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test. It is used to test research questions and hypotheses where you want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single dependent variable. You are asking if there is a significant difference between the groups based on a single categorical independent variable with multiple levels. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-8.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-8.png" target="_self">
<br><img alt="Midterm 2-9.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-9.png" target="_self"> If you are dealing with individuals, you are likely to encounter this situation using two different types of study design: One study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then randomly split this group into three or more smaller groups (i.e., each participant is allocated to one, and only one, group). You then get each group to undertake different tests (or put them under different conditions) and measure the outcome/response on the same dependent variable. For example, a researcher wishes to know whether different pacing strategies affect the time to complete a marathon. The researcher randomly assigns a group of volunteers to either a group that (a) starts slow and then increases their speed, (b) starts fast and slows down or (c) runs at a steady pace throughout. The time to complete the marathon is the outcome (dependent) variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-5.png" target="_self"> A second study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then split them into groups based on some independent variable. Again, each individual will be assigned to one group only. This independent variable is sometimes called an attribute independent variable because you are splitting the group based on some attribute that they possess (e.g., their level of education; every individual has a level of education, even if it is 'none'). Each group is then measured on the same dependent variable having undergone the same task or condition (or none at all). For example, a researcher is interested in determining whether there are differences in leg strength between amateur, semi-professional and provessional rugby players. The force/strength measured on an isokinetic machine is the dependent variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-6.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-6.png" target="_self"> <br>Every time you conduct a t-test there is a chance that you will make a <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. This error is usually 5%. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of "making a mistake" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests. However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors. An ANOVA controls for these errors so that the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> remains at 5% and you can be more confident that any statistically significant result you find is not just running lots of tests.

Make a decision. When you choose to analyze your data using a one-way ANOVA, part of the process involves checking to make sure that the data you want to analyze can actually be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a one-way ANOVA if your data "passes" six assumptions that are required for a one-way ANOVA to give you a valid result. <br>Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (<a data-href="Interval Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Interval Variable</a> and <a data-href="Ratio Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratio Variable</a>) (i.e., they are <a data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous Variable</a>; IQ score, exam scores, weight, etc).
The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group that is being compared in the one-way ANOVA (technically, it is the residuals that need to be normally distributed, but the results will be the same). <br>For example, if we were comparing three groups (e.g., amateur, semi-professional, and professional rugby players) on their leg strength, their leg strength values (<a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>) would have to be normally distributed for the amateur group of players, normally distributed for the semi-professionals and normally distributed for the professional player. You can test for normality in SPSS. <br><a data-href="Testing for Normality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Testing for Normality</a> <br>Your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> is <a data-href="Nominal Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/nominal-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nominal Variable</a>. There is homogeneity of variances. This means that the population variances in each group are equal. If you use SPSS Statistics, Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances is included in the output when you run a one-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics. SPSS: Make sure to select the option of 'homogeneity of variance test.'

This is mostly a study design issue and, as such, you will need to determine whether you believe it is possible that your observations are not independent based on your study design. <br>Your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Typically, a one-way ANOVA is used when you have three or more categorical, independent groups, but it can be used for just two groups (but an <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> is more commonly used for two groups)
Example independent variables that meet this criterion include ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate, and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist) and so forth. <br>You should have <a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. For example, there must be different participants in each group with no participant being in more than one group. This is more of a study design issue than something you can test for. If your study fails this assumption, you will need to use another statistical test instead of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., a repeated measures design). <br>If you are unsure whether your study meets this assumption, use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://statistics.laerd.com/features-selecting-tests.php" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://statistics.laerd.com/features-selecting-tests.php" target="_self">Features - Statistical Test Selector | Laerd Statistics</a>. There should be no significant outliers. Outliers are simply data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern (e.g., in a study of 100 students' IQ scores, where the mean score was 108 with only a small variation between students, one student had a score of 156, which is very unusual, and may even put her in the top 1% of IQ scores globally). The problem with outliers is that they can have a negative effect on the one-way ANOVA, reducing the validity of your results. <br>Your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. We talk about the one-way ANOVA only requiring approximately normal data because it is quite 'robust' to violations of normality, meaning that assumption can be a little violated and still provide valid results. You can test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which is easily tested for using SPSS Statistics.<br>

You can test this assumption in SPSS Statistics using Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If your data fails this assumption, you will need to not only carry out a Welch ANOVA instead of a one-way ANOVA, which you can do using SPSS Statistics, but also use a different post hoc test. Levene's test tells us if we have met the assumption that the two groups have approximately equal variances on the dependent variable. If Levene's Test is significant ('Sig.' is less than .05), the two variances are significantly different. If Levene's Test is not significant, then the two variances are approximately equal, and the assumption is met. <br>The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options: Transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed
Choose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality. There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated. Welch
Brown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you can run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most situations, it has been shown that the Welch test is the best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in SPSS. A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumptions to fail. Often, there is little you can do that offers a good solution to this problem. Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-Way ANOVA<br>

You should not report the result as 'Significant difference,' but instead report it as 'statistically significant difference.' this is because your decision as to whether the result is significant or not should not be based solely on your statistical test. Difference A one-way ANOVA was used to test for mean differences in science type depending on the intent to stay. It was predicted that there would be differences among the science types, though no specific group differences were made a priori. Assumptions of the one-way ANOVA were upheld. For example, data was generally normally distributed with histograms following a normal distribution curve and a significant Shapiro-Wilk‚Äôs test. Similarly, HOV was upheld via a significant F value (F (2, 27) = 4.467, p = .021). There was a statistically significant difference between groups as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 4.467, p = .021). No Difference A one-way ANOVA was used to test for mean differences in science type depending on the intent to stay. It was predicted that there would be differences among the science types, though no specific group differences were made a priori. Assumptions of the one-way ANOVA were upheld. For example, data was generally normally distributed with histograms following a normal distribution curve and a significant Shapiro-Wilk‚Äôs test. Similarly, HOV was upheld via a significant F value (F (1, 42) = .010, p = .086). The results of the omnibus test suggests that there not statistically significant mean level differences in science type depending on the intent to stay (F (1, 42) = .010, p = .086, R2 = .00). The small effect size suggests that 0% of the observed variance in the science type can be explained by the intent to stay. Report the result of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., 'There were no statistically significant differences between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 1.397, p = .15). Running a post hoc test is usually not warranted and should not be carried out. You need to report your results. You then need to follow-up the one-way ANOVA by running a post hoc test. You need to perform the same procedures as above, but add into your results section that this assumption was violated and you needed to run a Welch F test. ANOVA test tells you whether you have an overall difference between your groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups differed - post hoc tests do. Because post hoc tests are run to confirm where the differences occurred between groups, they should only be run when you have a shown an overall statistically significant difference in group means (i.e., a statistically significant one-way ANOVA result). Post hoc tests attempt to control the experiment-wise error rate (usually alpha = 0.05) in the same manner that the one-way ANOVA is used instead of multiple t-tests. Post hoc tests are termed a posteriori tests; that is, performed after the event (the event in this case being a study). There are a great number of different post hoc tests that you can use. However, you should only run one post hoc test - do not run multiple post hoc tests. For a one-way ANOVA, you will probably find that just two tests need to be considered. If your data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances, use Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. Note that if you use SPSS Statistics, Tukey's HSD test is simply referred to as 'Tukey' in the post post hoc multiple comparisons dialogue box.

This means that for each one year increase in age, there is a decrease in VO2max of 0.165 ml/min/kg. You can test for the statistical significance of each of the independent variables. This tests whether the unstandardized (or standardized) coefficients are equal to 0 in the population. If p &lt; .05, you can conclude that the coefficients are statistically significantly different to 0. The t-value and corresponding p-value are located in the 't' and 'Sig.' columns, respectively.<br>

Normal Distribution (Z-Scores)]]></title><description><![CDATA[
The area of probability began in the Middle Ages (17th and 18th centuries).
Royal and affluent gamblers consulted with mathematicians for advice on games of chance and gambling. Probability was also used for practical purposes to help determine life expectancy for life insurance policies. P(A) = S / T P(A) is probability of event A
S is # of times event A can occur
T is the total # of events possible Example with a fair six-sided die: P (4) = S/T = 1/6
P (x &gt;/= 5) = 2/6 = 33.3% The sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes is exactly 1 (i.e., 100% chance)
The probability of any given event (a) cannot exceed 1 and (b) cannot be less than 0. An event having a probability of 1 means that no other event can possibly occur. "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." (Benjamin Franklin, 1789) Related to 0, although you cannot speak of an event occurring less than never, you can have an event with 0 probability. "You can't win the lottery if you don't buy a ticket." Long ago many disciplines found that a particular bell-shaed or normal curve occurred often with many different variables (recall histograms).
Later in the 1700 s, mathematicians were called on to find an equation to approximate the normal distribution. If an equation could be developed then the probability associated with any point on the curve could be determined. Until 1920, the development of the equation was attributed to Karl Friedrich Gauss, and it was known as the Gaussian curve. Then Pearson, however, found this equation written earlier than Gauss's time in an article by Abraham DeMoivre in 1733 and renamed the curve as the normal distribution. <img alt="4.

F (x): probability density function
ùúá: 'Location' parameter (center), can be estimated by sample mean ùë•. ùúé: 'Scale' parameter (spread), can be estimated by sample standard deviation s. ùúã ‚âà 3.14159

Bell-shaped
Unimodal
Aymptotic (the curve goes on forever on both sides of ùúá) There are an infinite number of normal curves, one for every distinct pair of values of the mean and variance. Every member of the family of normal curves has the same characteristics except that the scale, mean, and variance can differ across different variables and populations. General Notation: ùë•i~ùëÅ(ùúá, ùúé2) Xi follow a normal distribution with mean ùúá and variance (ùúé2). Notice this notation reports variance (ùúé2), not standard deviation (ùúé).
From a sample: ùë•i~ùëÅ(ùúá, ùúé2) For any random variable x, there are an infinite number of possibilities even within a small range. Theoretically, probability of x being a specific value is zero. P (x=xobs)=0
<br>For <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> data, we find probability always within a range or interval, but we can make that interval as small as we like. Probability: Area under the curve between two values. Normal Curve (68-95-99.7 rule): 68.3% of scores are expected to fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean. (ùë• ¬± 1s)
95.4% of scores are expected to fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (ùë• ¬± 2s)
99.7% of scores are expected to fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean (ùë• ¬± 3s) We can convert any normal distribution to a standard normal distribution (aka unit normal distribution or standard unit normal distribution). Z-score: The standardized scores. This allows us to evaluate an individual's performance relative to the scores in the distribution. Make comparisons between two different individuals, or across two different variables. Identify extreme values (outliers)
<br><img alt="4. Normal Distribution (Z-Scores)-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/4.-normal-distribution-(z-scores)-2.png" target="_self">
Notation: ùë•i~ùëÅ(0,1) Mean is 0. Variance (and standard deviation) is 1. To standardize, center mean to 0 and transform (stretch or compress) standard deviation to 1. Equation: zi = (xi-ùúá)/ùúé For sample data: zi = (xi-ùúá)/s Useful equation: Xi=(ùúá+zi)(ùúé)
Xi=(x+zi)(s) for sample data A typical z-table reports cumulative probability given a z score (i.e., area under the curve to the left of z, think PRz=%).
We can determine any area under the curve (below or above a give z, or between any two z values).
We can also find a specific z value given the cumulative probability (think P%=z). 68.3% of data within 1 standard deviation from the mean? P (z ‚â§ 1) - P (z ‚â§-1)= 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826 95.4% data within 2 standard deviations from the mean? P (z ‚â§ 2) - P (z ‚â§ -2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544 99.7% data within 3 standard deviations from the mean? P (z ‚â§ 1) - P (z ‚â§ -1) = 0.9987 - 0.0013 = 0.9974 In a recent census, the average income for several large rural counties was ùúá = $35, 285 and the standard deviation was ùúé = $7,200. What proportion of families have incomes below $35,000? Want to find P (x&lt;35000)
Convert x ($) to z, given mean and standard deviation: Z = (x-ùúá)/ùúé = (35000-35285)/7200 = -0.04
So we are looking for P (z ‚â§ -0.04) = 0.4840 About 48.4% of families had household incomes below $35,000. What was the 80th percentile household income? Use z-table to find the z score with cumulative probability 80% (area is 0.8000).
Z = 0.845 (between 0.84 and 0.85 from table)
Convert to $ (recall z = (x-ùúá)/ùúé): X = (ùúá + z)(ùúé) = (35,285 + 0.845)(7200) ‚âà 41369 The 80th percentile household income was $41,369. Learning a new instrument is exciting, but it takes consistent practicing to truly make music. A study shows aspiring musicians usually spend about 30 minutes practicing every day, with a standard deviation of 12.5 minutes. Assuming the practice time follows a normal distribution, what is the probability of a student practicing more than 70 minutes a day? We want to find P (x &gt; 70)
Convert x to z, given mean and standard deviation: Z = (x-ùúá)/ùúé) = (70-30)/12.5 = 3.2 So we are looking for P (z &gt; 3.2) From z-table, P (z ‚â§ 3.2) = 0.9993 (table only gives area to the left. )
So P (z &gt; 3.2) = 1-0.9993 = 0.0007 There is only a slight chance (0.07%) that a student would practice more than 70 minutes a day. The GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item assessment) is a short questionnaire used to screen for anxiety. GAD-7 scores range from 0 to 21 and indicate the severity of generalized anxiety. In a clinical study based on 90 participants, the distribution of GAD-7 scores followed a normal distribution with a mean of 6.3 and a standard deviation of 2.8. Given the descriptive statistics, how many participants were considered to have moderate anxiety? Probability between 10 and 15 is P (x ‚â§ 15) - P (x ‚â§ 10). I used range 10-15 to include the score of 14. P (z ‚â§ (15-6.3)/2.8) - P (z ‚â§ 3.11) - P (z ‚â§ 1.32)
From z-table: 0.991 - 0.9066 = 0.0925 ‚âà 9.3%
About 9.3% of the 90 participants had a GAD-7 score between 10 to 14. That is about 8 individuals (90 x 9.3% ‚âà 8) who were considered to have moderate anxiety. The average June daily high temperature in Ohio is 80ÀöF, with a standard deviation of 3 degrees. Normality assumed, what are the expected range (high and low) of daily high temperatures 95% of the time? Find the middle 95% range from z-table: each tail is (1-0.95)/2 = (0.05/2) = 0.025
Z for upper limit (can be notated as z0.025): 1.96 (area to the left is 0.9750)
Z for lower limit: -1.96 (area to the left is 0.0250) Notice the two z scores have the same value but different signs (symmetric). Middle 95% range for z: 0 ¬± 1.96 or (-1.96, 1.96)
Convert to temperature (ùúá ¬± 1.96 x ùúé): 80 ¬± 1.96 x 3 = 80 ¬± 5.88 = (74.86)
95% of the time, June daily high temperature in Ohio fluctuates between 74ÀöF and 86ÀöF. Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Descriptives Check option Save standardized values as variables. Negative and decimal values occur in a standard normal distribution, thus other types of standardized scores have been developed, such as: SAT (College Board): ¬µ = 500, ùúé = 100
IQ: ¬µ = 100, ùúé = 15
Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE): ¬µ = 50, ùúé = 21.06 Many analyses require the normality assumption (i.e., variables should be normally distributed in the populaiton). Most tests are robust against such violations if sample size is large (30).
However, non-normality is often associated with biased standard deviations, which affects decision making in hypothesis testing. If non-normality is severe, we might need to transform the data. For non-normal and small samples, other alternative nonparametric tests are available. Recall boxplot: Is the median in the middle of the box? Recall Central Tendency: Is median close to the mean? Compare Histogram (data) to normal curve (theory): SPSS: In Histogram, check option Display normal curve. Skewness and kurtosis ratios within ¬±2 or ¬±3. Forthcoming: Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot)
Tests for normality: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test "Whenever the smallest or the largest observation is less than one standard deviation from the mean, this is evidence of severe skew." This suggests that the distribution of scores is very compressed on one side of the mean. SPSS measures skewness by the 3 rd moment about the mean: ‚àë(z3/n) If normal, this measure should be 0. Negative (Skew to the left)
Positive (Skew to the right) Skewed if standardized skewness |skew√∑se (skew)| ‚â• 2 (large sample) or ‚â• 3 (small sample) Se(skew) is the standard error of the skewness measure. Access "whether or not there are more or fewer extreme scores than expected in a normal distribution." Generally, kurtosis is less concerning than skewness. SPSS measures kurtosis by the 4th moment about the mean: ‚àë(z4√∑n) - 3 If normal (mesokurtic), this measure should be 0. Negative kurtosis (platykurtic): flat or broad
Positive kurtosis (leptokurtic): slender or narrow Non-normal if standardized kurtosis |kurtosis√∑se (kurtosis)| ‚â• 2 (large sample) or ‚â• 3 (small sample) is the standard error of the kurtosis measure. <br><img alt="Kurtosis Graph.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/kurtosis-graph.png" target="_self">

Midterm will cover the materials from lectures 1-6: Sampling, measurement, data representation, descriptive statistics, normal distribution, z-scores, CLT, hypothesis testing, one-sample t-test, and one-sample t-test. Questions will be posted in Carmen (Assignments -&gt; Midterm) on 6/27 (Thursday) morning. A 'homework' named 'Midterm' will open in Top Hat. Multiple choice
30 questions Work through the problems and enter your answer in Top Hat by 7/2 (Tuesday) 11:59pm. Be aware of the hard deadline. Top Hat will automatically grade your exam and publish the answers after the due date/time. No class on 7/1 (Monday) or Lab on 7/2 (Tuesday) What is Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in a nutshell? When sample size is large, sampling distribution of the mean is normal or approximately normal regardless of population distribution. How to interpret a 95% confidence interval? The interval covers the population (true) mean 95% of the time. What is a null hypothesis? Null hypothesis is saying that the intervention is not working. Says there is no statistical significance between two variables. Alternative hypothesis is the expected outcome researchers have theorized. Most of the time you want to reject the null hypothesis because there would be no statistical significance between variables (not statistically significant) What is the confidence level corresponding to a 0.05 alpha (Type I error) level? 95%
Type I error is falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. It should not happen a lot. How extreme our sample mean to make it not based on chance. You can only commit Type I error 5% of the time. It only allows <img alt="6.

If your observed z-score needs to be grater than 1.96 standard deviations above or below the mean. Comparing Type 1 Error to p-value If your p-value is greater Used for questions about whether the population mean (¬µ) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (¬µ0). Non-directed (two-sided) or directional (one-sided)
Population standard deviation (ùúé) is known.
Assumptions: Observations come from a random sample, and subjects are independent of each other. Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30). Used for questions about whether the population standard mean (¬µ) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (¬µ0).
Non-directional (two-sided) or directional (one-sided)
Population standard deviation (ùúé) is unknown: estimated by sample standard deviation (s).
Assumptions: Observations come from a random sample, and subjects are independent of each other. Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30). In most research projects, population standard deviation (ùúé) are usually unknown. But we can use our sample to compute a sample standard deviation (s). So we are now estimating two population parameters: Population mean (¬µ) is being estimated by the sample mean (x bar).
Population standard deviation (ùúé) is being estimated by the sample standard deviation (s). Recall standard error of the mean: ùúéx bar = ùúé √∑ ‚àön (ùúé is known)
Now we can estimate: ùúéx bar = s √∑ ‚àön. Recall for one-sample z-test: zobs = (x bar - ¬µ0) √∑ (ùúé √∑ ‚àön) (ùúé is known)
Now it is estimated by: (x bar - ¬µ0) √∑ (s √∑ ‚àön) But is it still normally distributed? A new theoretical distribution for obtaining the critical values was developed: T-distribution (student's t-distribution) Developed by English statistician William Sealy Gosset under the pseudonym 'Student.'<br>
<img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power.png" target="_self">
Symmetric and bell-shaped like the normal distribution, but t-distribution has heavier tails (i.e., more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean).
The shape of t-distribution depends on degrees of freedom (df or v).
Shape of t-distribution depends on df (or sample size) <br><img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power.webp" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power.webp" target="_self"> Q. What did the z-distribution say to the t-distribution?
A: You may look like me but you are not normal. Non-directional (two-tailed): To test if mean where sample came from (¬µ) is significantly different from hypothesized mean (¬µ0). H0: ¬µ = ¬µ0 vs. H1: ¬µ ‚â† ¬µ0 Alternatively in terms of mean difference: H0: ¬µ - ¬µ0 = 0 vs. H1: ¬µ - ¬µ0 ‚â† 0 Directional (One-Tailed): H0: ¬µ ‚â§ ¬µ0 vs. H1: ¬µ &gt; ¬µ0
H0: ¬µ ‚â• ¬µ0 vs. H1: ¬µ &lt; ¬µ0 Reject H0 if tobs = (x bar - ¬µ0) √∑ (s √∑ ‚àön) falls into the critical region (determined by tcrit given the df) A t-table might be used to determine the critical values (tcrit) and rejection region. Different t-tables might be constructed differently.
For the t-tables used in class, table entries are positive t values, given specific (common) probabilities of the upper tail. (Symmetric so you can figure out negative t)
Look for t value given the degrees of freedom (df = n - 1) and ùúé level (Area is ùúé √∑ 2 for two-tailed and ùúé for one-tailed) or confidence level (default is two-tailed)
At ùúé = 0.05 (95% confidence level), n = 30, two-tailed test, what is the t value? From the t-table, df = 30 - 1 = 29
Upper tail is 0.025 (or 95% at the bottom)
On the t-table, t = 2.045. Recall z0.025 = 1.96, which agrees that a t-distribution has heavier tails than z-distribution. Theoretically, when sample size approaches infinity (‚àû), t equals z. However, t-table does not have all the possible sample sizes so we rely on SPSS (p-value reported). Consider the data we collected last time sample data of the prices of OSU students are willing to pay for Gardyn (aka, willingness to pay or WTP): n = 20 (Our class is small, but your samples are usually larger)
x bar = 181.9
s = 231.2 (This is bigger than the ùúé, because we treated the class as population last time) Retail price is $899 with unknown population ùúé Research question: Is OSU's students' WTP (estimated by x bar) significantly different from the retail price (¬µ0 = 899) at 95% confidence level (i.e., should the company consider OSU students its target customers?) Average (mean) willingness to pay (WTP) is $181.9 with a standard deviation of $231.20.

SPSS reports p-values for both one-sided (directional) and two-sided (non-directional) tests. However, confidence interval (CI) of mean difference is only constructed for two-sided.

H1: Œº ‚â† 899 or Œº - 899 ‚â† 0
Mean difference: x bar&nbsp;- Œº0 = 181.9 - 899 =-717.1 (Check SPSS results)
tobs = (x bar - ¬µ0) √∑ (s √∑ ‚àön) = -717.1 √∑ 51.701 = -13.87
Degree of Freedom (df) = 20 - 1 = 19
From t-table, tcrit = -2.093
Since tobs &lt; tcrit, we can reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that OSU students' WTP for Gardyn is significantly different (lower) from the retail price.
Alternatively, build a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference and reject H0 if it does not cover 0. 95% confidence interval: (x bar - ¬µ0) ¬± tdf, ùúé/2 x (s √∑ ‚àön) -717.1 ¬± 2.093 x 51.701 ‚âà (-825.31, -608.89)
Recall last time we created a 95% CI for x bar and checked if it covered ¬µ0.
Sometimes hand-calculated numbers may have some rounding errors, but they should still be very close to the SPSS outputs. Since the 95% CI does not cover 0, we can conclude that OSU students' WTP for Gardyn is significantly different from the retail price.
Finally, the easiest way: Compare p-value to Œ± (alpha, usually .05). Reject H0 if p &lt; Œ± (alpha).
According to SPSS (two-sided), our p-value is extremely small (p &lt; .001). When p-value is extremely small (very close to 0), we‚Äôd report p &lt; .001. NEVER report p = 0!
Otherwise, report the observed p-value without the leading 0 (e.g., p = .003, p = .04, p = .52). ‚Ä¢Since p &lt; Œ± (.05), we can reject H0 and conclude that WTP for Gardyn is significantly different from the retail price. For one-sample t-test (population œÉ unknown), we use Cohen‚Äôs d to report effect size.
Cohen‚Äôs d = (x bar - Œº0) √∑ s Recall Cohen‚Äôs d for one-sample z-test: d = (x bar - Œº0) √∑ ùúé So, here sample SD (ùúé) is used to estimate ùúé.
Notice, unlike z or t scores, effect sizes are not affected by sample size Size of Cohen's d (by convention): Small effect: d = ¬± 0.2 Medium effect: d = ¬± 0.5 Large effect: d = ¬± 0.8 Cohen's d = (x bar - Œº0) √∑ s = -717.1 √∑ 231.215 = -3.101 Large effect size (in reality, observing such a large effect size is highly unlikely!) SPSS also reports Hedges‚Äôs g: Cohen‚Äôs d appears to be biased for small samples (n &lt; 20). Hedge‚Äôs g serves as an unbiased estimator of the population effect size.
Hedges‚Äôs g ‚âà d √ó {1 - (3 √∑ (4 √ó df - 1)}
Gardyn pricing example: Hedges‚Äôs g ‚âà -3.101 √ó {1 - (3 √∑ (4 √ó 19 - 1)} = -2.977 <br><img alt="6.

When the sample size is adequate (n = 20), we can use Cohen's d. (Your samples are usually larger.)
The effect size is -3.101, indicating a large effect of the mean difference OSU students are unlikely to be Gardyn's target customers. A one-sample t-test was conducted at an alpha level of .05 to answer the research question: Is OSU students‚Äô willingness to pay (WTP) for Gardyn significantly different from the retail price $899? The null hypothesis stated that WTP would not differ from the retail price. The alternative hypothesis stated that WTP would differ from the retail price.
Based on a random sample of 20 OSU students, there was a mean WTP of $181.9 and a standard deviation of $231.215. Then compared against the hypothesized mean of $899, the one-sample t-test was statistically significant, t(19) = -13.87, p &lt; .001, indicating WTP is significantly different from $899.
In addition, the effect size Cohen‚Äôs d was -3.101, generally interpreted as a large effect (Cohen, 1988), indicating that there is about 3 standard deviations difference between WTP and retail price, with the WTP lower than the retail price. SPSS reports both one-sided and two-sided p-values, but only two-sided CI is reported. To obtain one-sided upper or lower confidence limits, run a test doubling the ùõº (alpha) level This doe snot affect the p-values reported in the output. Say if you are conducting a directional test a 95% confidence level and want to see LCL or UCL, you can change the confidence interval percentage from 95% to 90% in Options. The lower end of reported 90% CI would be 95% LCL (Lower Control Limit), and the upper end of reported 90% CI would be 95% (Upper Control Limit). Any variation detected inside the control limits probably occurred by chance. On the other hand, variation outside of the control limits likely occurred due to special causes. The upper control limit (UCL) and the&nbsp;lower control limit&nbsp;(LCL) serve as boundaries for expected deviation in data.

Power is determined by the following factors: Factors that can be controlled by the researcher: Level of significance (Œ±): As Œ± increases, power increases.
Sample size (n): As n increases, power increases.
Non-directional or directional test: Power is greater for a directional (one-tailed) test. Factors that cannot be controlled by the researcher: Size of population standard deviation (œÉ): As œÉ increases, power decreases. ‚Ä¢Difference between true population mean (Œº) and hypothesized mean (Œº0): As difference increases, power increases.

Bonferroni correction, named after Carlo Bonferroni, counteracts this problem by testing each individual hypothesis at a significance level of Œ± √∑ m, controlling desired overall (familywise) Œ± level.
The simplest and most conservative method to control Type I error in multiple hypothesis testing. 6 t-tests were conducted (m = 6).
To control the overall (familywise) Œ± level at .05, with Bonferroni correction, each item‚Äôs p-value is now compared to the critical value Œ± √∑ m = .05 √∑ 6 = .008.
The 2nd question (p = .021) is no longer significant after Bonferroni correction. The 6th question (p = .003) remain significant.
Can also create more conservative CI‚Äôs: 100 (1 - Œ± / m)%: 99.2% CI‚Äôs are wider than 95% CI‚Äôs, making them more likely to cover the test value (Œº0). One-sample z-test and one-sample t-test are considered robust for violations of normal distribution (i.e., assumption can be violated without serious errors). CLT assures that, for a large sample, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal regardless of the shape of population.
However, when sample size is very small (e.g., n &lt; 5), the test is not robust to non-normality. (Some studies also found the test is not as robust for one-tailed tests even with large samples). Non-normality can inflate the standard error of the mean, reduce power, and affect control of Type I error. Other non-parametric alternatives are available. They do not make assumptions on distribution.

Here we begin to move from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics. After collecting sample data and generating sample statistics, we may also want to know to what extend we can generalize from these sample statistics to their corresponding population parameters (e.g., What does x tell us about ¬µ?)
We already understand how probability and distribution(s) work. Now we want to know (a) how much uncertainty exists in our sample statistics, and (b) how much confidence can we place in our sample statistics. Inferential statistics allow us to make an inference or generalization from a sample to the population. Step 1: Population of interest Step 2: Draw sample Step 3: Compute sample statistics Step 4: Make inference back to the population Allows you to grow 30 plants simultaneously in just two square feet. Designed specifically for indoor growing - no dirt, no mess. LED-light column design boosts plant growth, makes it easier to maintain and brings natural beauty to your home. AI-powered with 24/7 plant monitoring. N = 20 Mean ¬µ = 181.9
225.36 Each sample has n = 4
All sample means ùë• have been calculated. Mean of the sampling distribution of the mean ¬µx = 165.36
Standard Error of the Mean ùúéx = 121.48
How does ùúéx compare to ùúé? In our Gardyn pricing experiment, we took random samples of size n = 4 students and recorded each sample's mean x1, x2, x3,‚Ä¶ and many other samples. Each sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean. We can construct a frequency distribution of sample means, known as the sampling distribution of the mean. It is the distribution of x for all possible samples of size n. The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean (¬µx) is the estimate of population mean (i.e., ¬µx = ¬µ). Sampling error (x - ¬µx): the difference (deviation) between a particular sample mean and the population mean. Variance error of the mean (ùúé 2/x): the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean. Standard error of the mean (ùúéx): the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. As sample size n increases (say 30), the sampling distribution of the mean from a random sample more closely approximates a normal distribution. If the population distribution is normal, then the sampling distribution of the mean is also normal in shape. If the population distribution is not normal, then the sampling distribution of the mean becomes more nearly normal as sample size increases ('approximately normal') In reality, we'd only draw sample once and observe one sample mean x (i.e., ùúéx is not calculated from various samples). According to CLT, we can use x to estimate ¬µ with the standard error of the mean ùúéx = (ùúé √∑ ‚àön) <img alt="5. Sampling Distribution of the Mean (One-Sample Z-Test).png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/5.-sampling-distribution-of-the-mean-(one-sample-z-test).png" target="_self"> CLT tells us the theoretical distribution of the sample mean x so we don't have to take hundreds of samples, find their mean and variance or create a histogram in order to use this information!
We can create a confidence interval (CI) for the mean: Rather than a point estimate for a population parameter, we can construct an interval estimate (i.e., the likely range capturing the population parameter). Hypothesis tests about the mean. So we can make a decision about a parameter based on sample data. Allow us to move from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics. Recall last time: Convert a data point x to z-score: z = (x - ¬µ) √∑ ùúé Now, since sampling distribution of the mean follows a normal distribution: Mean: ¬µx = ¬µ Standard Error of the Mean: ùúéx = ùúé √∑ ‚àön To convert a sample mean x to z score: Z = (x - ¬µ) √∑ ùúéx = (x - ¬µ) √∑ (ùúé √∑ ‚àön) Recall last time: In a recent census, the average income for several large rural counties was ¬µ = $35,285 and the standard deviation was ùúé = $7,200. Now, suppose a sample of n = 400 households was randomly selected from this region. Describe the sample distribution of the mean. What is the probability that the average income from the sample is: Below $35,000?
Exceeding $39,000?
Between $35,000 and $35,500? According to CLT, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. Mean: ¬µx = ¬µ = $35,285 Standard Error of the Mean: ùúéx = ùúé √∑ ‚àön = $7,200 √∑ ‚àö400 = $360 Convert sample mean x to z score: z = (x - ¬µ) √∑ ùúéx = (x - 35285) √∑ 360. Or in one step: Z = (x - ¬µ) √∑ (ùúé √∑ ‚àön) = (x - 35,285) √∑ (7,200 √∑ ‚àö400) Use z table to find the corresponding probability smaller than z.
P (x &lt; $35,000) = P (z &lt; (35,000 - 35,285)√∑360) = P (z &lt; -0.79) = 21.48%. P (x &lt; $39,000) = P (z &lt; (39,000 - 35,285)√∑360) = P (z &gt; 10.32) = 1 - P (z &lt; 10.32) ‚âà 0. It is extremely unlikely to observe a sample mean more than $39,000. P ($35,000 &lt; x &lt; $35,500) = P ((35,000 - 35,285) √∑ 360) &lt; z &lt; ((35,500 - 35,285) √∑ 360) = P (-0.79 &lt; z &lt; 0.60) = P (z &lt; 0.60) - P (z &lt; -0.79)
0.7257 -0.2148 = 51.09% Given a confidence level 100 (1 - ùõº)%, we can build an interval estimates for the population mean from sample mean (x). The most common confidence level is 95% (ùõº = 0.05).
Reported as lower confidence limit (LCL) and upper confidence limit (UCL), aka lower confidence bound (LCB) and upper confidence bound (UCB).
General form: 100 (1 - ùõº)&amp; CI = x ¬± za/2x ùúéx (Recall ùúéx = ùúé √∑ ‚àön) 90% CI = x ¬± 2.645 x ùúéx
95% CI = x ¬± 1.96 x ùúéx
99% CI = x ¬± 2.575 x ùúéx Interpretation: The confidence interval will contain the true population mean 100 (1 - ùõº) out of 100 times. Here we define the area in the tails as ùõº. Since we have 2 tails, each tail is ùõº √∑ 2 This is for nondirectional CI. For directional, no need to find ùõº √∑ 2. Notice the table entry is the area under the curve to the left of z (i.e., PR), not the tail. Recall last time: The average June daily high temperature in Ohio is 80ÀöF, with a standard deviation of 3 degrees. 95% of the time, June daily high temperature in Ohio fluctuates between 74ÀöF and 86ÀöF. ¬µ ¬± 1.96 x ùúé: 80 ¬± 1.96 = 80 ¬± 5.88 (74, 86) Now, if we take a random sample of 100 June daily high temperatures from different dates/locations in Ohio, what is the sampling distribution of the mean? What is the 95% confidence interval (CI)? According to CLT, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. Mean: ¬µx = ¬µ = 80 Standard Error of the Mean: ùúéx = ùúé √∑ ‚àön = 3 √∑ ‚àö100 = 0.3 95% CI: ¬µ ¬± 1.96 x ùúéx: 80 ¬± 1.96 x 0.3 = 80 ¬± 0.588 ‚âà (79.4, 80.6) Interpretation: With 95% confidence (i.e., 95 out of 100 times), our interval (79.5ÀöF, 80.6ÀöF) covers Ohio's true average June daily high temperature. 90% CI: ¬µ ¬± 1.645 x ùúéx: 80 ¬± 1.645 x 0.3 = 80 ¬± 0.4935 ‚âà (79.5, 80.5)
99% CI: ¬µ ¬± 2.575 x ùúéx: 80 ¬± 2.575 x 0.3 = 80 ¬± 0.7725 ‚âà (79.2, 80.8) Scores on a physical performance test for middle school students have been normed nationally for all students with a mean ¬µ = 175 and a standard deviation ùúé = 12. We took a sample of n = 120 students in Ohio found that the sample mean x = 162. Ohio population might be different from national norm so x = 162 deviates from ¬µ = 175. Suppose we'd like to estimate the population mean for Ohio based on this sample, what is the 95% confidence interval (CI)? Report the lower confidence limit (LCL) and the upper confidence limit (UCL). Population ¬µ = 175, ùúé = 12, Ohio Sample x = 162, n = 120
95% CI for Ohio population: x ¬± za √∑ 2 x ùúéx; or in one step: x ¬± za √∑ 2 x ùúé √∑ ‚àön
162 ¬±1.96 x 12 √∑ ‚àö120 = 162 ¬± 2.147 = (159.853, 164.147) Interpretation: We can be 95% confident that our interval covers the true population mean for Ohio (i.e., 95 out of 100 times, this CI would contain the true value of mean for the population to which we are generalizing). But is Ohio mean 162 significantly different from 175 (i.e., is the Ohio population from which we drew our sample the same population used to create the national norm)? Observation: Since 175 falls outside of the 95% CI (159.853, 164.147) of Ohio mean, it is likely that Ohio population deviates from the national norm. Hypothesis testing is a decision-making process where two possible decisions are weighed in a statistical fashion. Hypotheses are written for each decision and then sample data are used to help make the decision. Here we examine a statistical test to make inferences about a single mean with a known population standard deviation (ùúé): <br>One-sample t-test (<a data-href="6.

Independent T-Test, Homogeneity of Variance</a>) Null hypothesis (H0): A statement about the value of an unknown population parameter. There is no difference or a 'null' difference between the population and hypothesized means (statistical hypothesis, chance model). Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): The opposite of H0. The scientific hypothesis that the researcher believes the outcome of the study will be, based on previous research and theory (research hypothesis, your theory). Hypothesis testing in a nutshell: Compare sample statistics to hypothesized distribution. If the data evidence is extreme, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the event did not happen by chance. Instead, our theory is supported by data. Set up hypotheses based on the research question. Where does the sample/observed mean lie on the sampling distribution?
Given the confidence level 100 (1 - ùõº)%, what is considered extreme evidence?
Compared to the critical value is the sample mean extreme enough to be considered different from ùúá0? Probability of Type I Error (what we want to avoid in decision making).
Determine how far the sample mean needs to be from the hypothesized mean in order to reject H0. Set by the researcher or discipline, but the most commonly used values in the behavioral sciences and education are: ùõº = .05 (wrong 5% of the time, 95% confidence level)
ùõº = .01 (wrong 1% of the time, 99% confidence interval) A statistician is a person whose lifetime ambition is to be wrong 5% of the time. Nondirectional (two-tailed): to test whether the population mean (ùúá) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (ùúá0). Critical region can be either right (upper) or left (lower) tail. H0: ùúá = ùúá0
H1: ùúá ‚â† ùúá0 Directional (one-tailed): To test whether the population mean (ùúá) from which we drew sample is significantly greater or less than a specific hypothesized value (ùúá0). Right (upper) tail (test if greater): H0: ùúá ‚â§ ùúá0 vs. H1: ùúá &gt; ùúá0 Left (lower) tail (test if less): H0: ùúá ‚â• ùúá0 vs. H1: ùúá &lt; ùúá0 <br><img alt="5.

Used when population ùúé is known, to test if sample is drawn from the same population (ùúá0: hypothesized mean).
Consider the research question and decide nondirectional or directional. Set up null and alternative hypotheses. Calculate observed z-score from sample statistics. Recall: zobs = (x bar - ùúá0) √∑ (ùúé / ‚àöùëõ) Given confidence level and direction, find the critical z-score and region from table. Compare zobs to zcrit and reject H0 if zobs is in the critical region. Population ùúá = 175, ùúé = 12, Ohio sample x bar = 162, n = 120
Nondirectional (two-tailed) so the hypotheses are: H0: ùúá = 175

Same physical performance test normed nationally: ùúá = 175 and ùúé = 12. We now have a sample of n = 80 students from Colorado and found that the sample mean x bar = 177. Is it reasonable to assume that Colorado sample is drawn from the same national population? Test using ùõº = .05.
Population ùúá = 175 (ùúá0), ùúé = 12, Colorado sample ùë• bar = 177, ùëõ = 80 Nondirectional (two-tailed) so the hypotheses are: H0: ùúá = 175
H1: ùúá ‚â† 175 Calculate observed z-score: zobs = (x bar - ùúá0) √∑ (ùúé / ‚àöùëõ) (177‚àí175) √∑ (12 √∑ ‚àö80) ‚âà 1.49 Since ùõº = .05 and two-tailed (each tail is .025), look for z with area .9750: ùëßùëêùëüùëñùë° = 1.96 Critical (rejection) region: Reject H0 if ùëßùëúùëèùë† &gt; 1.96 (or ùëßùëúùëèùë†&lt; ‚àí1.96)
‚Ä¢ Since ùëßùëúùëèùë† &lt; 1.96, cannot reject H0, indicating Colorado sample comes from the same national norms. A high school has 49 seniors enrolled in a highly-ranked vocational program. The principal believes the mechanical ability of these seniors in the program is greater than their peers throughout the state. On a normed test of mechanical ability, the mean ùúá = 50 points with ùúé = 14 points. The sample average for the 49 seniors in the vocational program was found to be 53.4 points. At ùõº = .05, does the data support the principal‚Äôs claim?
Population ùúá = 175 (ùúá0), ùúé = 12, our senior sample ùë• bar = 53.4, ùëõ = 49
Directional (one-tailed) so the hypotheses are: H0: ùúá ‚â§ 50
H1: ùúá &gt; 50 To test if sample mean is greater, stop if x bar &lt; ùúá0 (impossible to be greater)
Calculate observed z-score: zobs = (x bar - ùúá0) √∑ (ùúé / ‚àöùëõ) (53.4‚àí50) √∑ (14 √∑ ‚àö49) ‚âà 1.7 Since ùõº = .05 and two-tailed (each tail is .025), look for z with area .9500: ùëßùëêùëüùëñùë° = 1.645
Critical (rejection) region: Reject H0 if ùëßùëúùëèùë† &gt; 1.645
Since ùëßùëúùëèùë† &gt; 1.645, we can reject H0 so the data support the effectiveness of the program. Notice this test would have been non-significant if it was non-directional (ùëßùëêùëüùëñùë° = 1.96). Reject H0 if ùúá0 falls outside of the 100 (1 - ùõº)% confidence interval. Two-tailed: CI (x bar ¬± zùõº √∑ 2 √ó (ùúé √∑ ‚àöùëõ)) does not cover ùúá0 One-tailed: Testing if x bar is greater: LCL (x bar - zùõº √∑ 2 √ó (ùúé √∑ ‚àöùëõ)) above ùúá0. Testing if x bar is smaller: UCL (x bar + zùõº √∑ 2 √ó (ùúé √∑ ‚àöùëõ)) below ùúá0. Physical Performance in Ohio (ùúá0 = 175, œÉ = 12, x bar = 162, n = 120): 95% CI: x bar ¬± zùõº/2 √ó (ùúé √∑ ‚àöùëõ) = 162 ¬± 1.96 √ó (12/‚àö120) = (159.853, 164.147)
Since 95% CI does not cover 175, we can reject H0 (Ohio mean is significantly different from national norm) Physical Performance in Colorado (ùúá0 = 175, œÉ = 12, x bar = 177, n = 80) 95% CI: x bar ¬± zùõº/2 √ó (ùúé √∑ ‚àöùëõ) = 177 ¬± 1.96 √ó (12/‚àö80) = (174.370, 179.630)
Since 95% CI does cover 175, we cannot reject H0 (No differences detected between Colorado mean and national) Vocational Program Example (ùúá0 = 50, œÉ = 14, x bar = 53.4, n = 49) 95% LCL: x bar ¬± zùõº/2 √ó (ùúé √∑ ‚àöùëõ) = 53.4 - 1.645 √ó (14/‚àö50) = 50.11(159.853, 164.147)
Since 95% LCL is greater than 50, we can reject H0 (Data supports the effectiveness of the program) Probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed. Visually, it is the area more extreme (same direction of critical region) than observed statistic. Therefore, comparing p-value to ùõº will reach the same conclusion as comparing observed and critical statistics. Reject H0 if p-value &lt; ùõº (i.e., sample stats in rejection region). ùõº is usually .05 (95% confidence level). Notice p-values remain the same for tests with different ùõº levels, but p-value from a non-directional (two-tailed) test is 2 times larger than pvalue from a directional (one-tailed) test. For extreme cases p-values can be very close to 0, but theoretically p-values cannot equal 0. Therefore, report p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)
Physical performance in Ohio: Look up ùëßùëúùëèùë† (-11.87) on z-table, p-value is very small! Since ùëù &lt; .001, reject H0 at 95% confidence level. (NEVER report ùëù = 0.) Physical performance in Colorado: Look up ùëßùëúùëèùë† (1.49) on z-table, p-value = 2 √ó (1 ‚àí .9319) = .1362 Since ùëù = .1362 (ùõº &gt; .05), cannot reject H0 at 95% confidence level. Vocational program: Look up ùëßùëúùëèùë† (1.70) on z-table, p-value = 1 ‚àí .9554 = .0446 Since ùëù = .0446 (&lt; .05), reject H0 at 95% confidence level. Notice this test would have been non-significant if it was non-directional (ùëù = 2 √ó .0446 = .0892, which would have been greater than .05). The idea is to compare sample statistics (say x bar) to the theorized distribution (say z). Reject H0 if data (zobs) shows extreme evidence (zcrit determined by ùõº level, usually .05). Three ways to reject H0 (one-sample z-test): The confidence interval constructed based on x bar does not cover ùúá0. zobs &gt; zcrit (or negative values, zobs &lt; zcrit)
p &lt; ùõº (usually .05) Hypothesis testing confirms if there is a significant effect (H0 rejected), but it does not tell us how large the effect is. The effect size tells us how large the effect is (i.e., how meaningful/practical the effect).
Different statistics have been developed to report effect size for different statistical analysis. For one-sample z-test (population ùúé known), we use Cohen's d to report effect size. Cohen's d = (x bar - ùúá0) √∑ (ùúé) (i.e., how many SD's the difference is)
Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ¬± 0.2: Small effect
d = ¬± 0.5: Medium effect
d = ¬± 0.8: Large effect Online Calculator: <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default2.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default2.aspx" target="_self">Cohen's D Effect Size Calculator for Z-Test</a> Physical performance in Ohio: d = (162 - 175) √∑ 12 = -1.083 (large) Physical Performance in Colorado: d = (177 - 175) √∑ 12 = 0.167 (small, recall test was non-significant) Vocational Program Example: d = (53.4 - 50) √∑ 14 = 0.243 (small) One-sample z-test is not available in SPSS menu, but there is a syntax available on YouTube by how2stats: <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjbL6nWEwA" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjbL6nWEwA" target="_self">One sample z test - SPSS (Part1) - YouTube</a>

Descriptive Statistics]]></title><description><![CDATA[
What do we do when we have research questions about a large sample of data? Carrying around the entire collection of data would be very difficult. Descriptive statistics summarize the data in an abbreviated fashion, but they provide sufficient information to depict the data. ùë•i: The score for ith person in the study or data set on variable x. Taking the sum of a set of scores is utilized quite often in statistics so we need a common system of notation for communicating about summation. En=1 xi: The sum of all data points of variable x. i=1 is the lower limit or beginning of the summation. i=n refers to the last person or the end of a data set. Ages from a sample of 10 coworkers: 24, 26, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46
n= 10 observations (subjects) Use N to notate size of the entire population. E10=1 xi = 24+26+28+28+31+31+31+35+38+47 = 318 Excel: =SUM (data range)
All excel formulas in this class are optional (but useful) A single index or value summarizing the entire collection of scores. Three most popular measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode. Mode: Most common or frequent value Median (Mdn): 50th percentile (or Q 2) or the middlemost value of an ordered set of scores. Mean: Arithmetic average The value in a distribution of scores that occurs most frequently. Sometimes there is no mode, and sometimes there are multiple modes. When there are two modes (bimodal distributions), some people report both modes. If they are adjacent, some people average the two modes. Goal is to faithfully describe the distribution of your data. Coworker example: 24, 26, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46
A new guy just joined the team: 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 Can be used with any type of measurement scales. Pros: simple to obtain, the only appropriate measure for nominal data. Cons: does not always have a unique value, not a function of all scores, difficult to deal with mathematically. We already know a lot about median (P50 or Q 2): Middle most value in an ordered set of data. After ordering the data, locate the ((n+1)/2) th observation. Coworker example (odd number): 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 New guy just quit (even number): 24, 26, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 Can be used with ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Pros: Not influenced by extreme scores (outliers)
Always has a unique value Cons: Not a function of all scores
Difficult to deal with mathematically Sample Mean = (sum of xi)/n Coworker example: 318/10 = 31.8
Excel: =Average (data range) Used to estimate population mean The larger our sample, the better our estimate of the true population mean. Only appropriate for interval and ratio measurement scales. Pros: Function of every score. Always has a unique value. Easy to deal with mathematically. Most stable of the measures of central tendency. Cons: Influenced by extreme scores. Very unusual or 'extreme'values tend to draw the mean towards these values and contribute to skew in the data. Coworker example: 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 Mean: 31.8
Median: 31
Mode: 31 A retired guy just rejoined the team: 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46, 75 Mean: 393/11 = 35.7
Median: 31
Mode: 31 For samples from a symmetric distribution (e.g., normal), mean, median, and mode should be very close to each other. When mean, median, and mode are far from each other, the data is skewed. Skewed to the right (long right tail, positive skew): Extreme large values
Skewed to the left (long left tail, negative skew): Extreme small values <img alt="Symmetrical Distribution.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/symmetrical-distribution.png" target="_self"><br>
<img alt="Skewedness.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/skewedness.png" target="_self">
Sometimes we may have the means of several groups of people, and we still want to find the average. Two ways to do this: Weighted Average (average all the original scores): Takes into account of each group's sample size. Average is appropriate 'weighted' by number of observations in each group. Unweighted Average (simply take the mean of the averages): Does not 'weight' or take account of the different sample sizes. AKA: mean of means, grand mean, usually used for group comparison. Example (Weight Average): 8150/100=81.5
Unweighted average: (85+80+75)/3=80 The mean alone is not enough to tell us about the shape of a distribution. Measures of dispersion describe the amount of variability among the scores (i.e., do the scores fall close to the central tendency measure or are the scores spread out?)
<br><img alt="Standard Deviations.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviations.png" target="_self">
There are no measures of dispersion appropriate for nominal data. We already know two measures of dispersion: Range and Interquartile range (IQR)
Both are measures of dispersion, but not a function of all scores. They are informative measures, but don't have very strong statistical properties. Difference between the largest and smallest scores. Pros: Simple to obtain. Cons: Influenced by extreme scores, only a function of two of the scores, unstable from sample to sample. Difference between the third quartile (Q 3) and the first quartiles (Q 1)
AKA H spread (stands for hinge, middle 50% of the distribution), developed by Tukey. Pros: Unaffected by extreme scores. Cons: Not a function of all scores, not very stable from sample to sample. The 'average' squared deviation from the mean for a set of scores. Variance is a better measure of dispersion than range and IQR, because it takes into account all the values for a set of scores (but might be affected by extreme values). Conceptually, the variance is a measure of the area of the distribution (i.e., the more spread out the scores, the more area or space the distribution takes up). The sample mean might not be the same as the population mean (usually unknown), and the deviations would be affected. Therefore, sample variance obtained would be systematically too small. In order to get an unbiased sample estimate of the population variance, a slight change in the computational formula was made. AKA Degree of Freedom (df) When we calculate a simple statistic based in part on another statistic, we have to consider the 'degrees of freedom' in our calculation. Given the sample mean, we do not need raw data from all n observations. We only need (n-1) observations, because the last missing score can be found from the mean (i.e., there is no 'freedom' in what this score might be).
The denominator (n-1) in sample variance is called the degrees of freedom (df), which is related to sample size. You may see many different forms of formulas out there to compute variances and forthcoming descriptive statistics. They all come from the same 'definitional' formula, but after being modified/simplified given the mathematical properties, some 'computational' formulas are easier to deal with by hand. But excel or SPSS will compute them for us anyway. Since variance is a squared value, it is difficult to interpret. The standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance, and it is the most common measure of dispersion. For population: ùúé = square root of ùúé2
For sample: ùúé = square root of ùúé2
Measured on the same scale as original data. Interpretation: On average, the deviations from the mean, but on average the distance from the mean is about 2.92. The 68-95-99.7 rule (more next time): About 68% of data points fall within +/- 1 standard deviation from the mean. About 95% of data points fall within +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean. About 99.7% of data points fall within +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean. Measure the shared variance (or co-variance) between variables x and y.

Difficult to interpret, because the value of covariance depends on the scale of the variables. Other measures are needed. Correlation coefficients are measures of relationship that are easier to interpret. The first correlation coefficient we consider is the Pearson correlation coefficient (usually notated as r), which measures the relationship between two interval or ratio variables. <br><img alt="3. Descriptive Statistics-4.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/3.-descriptive-statistics-4.png" target="_self"> Pearson r ranges from -1 to +/- 1 The sign denotes the direction of the relationship (positive or negative).
The value denotes the strength: 0 is the weakest correlation. +1 and -1 are the strongest correlation. Correlation does not imply causation. Don't need the leading zero in APA style writing, because r does not go beyond +/-1.

AKA dependent t-test:
Dependent variable (DV): Scores being compared Measured on at least an interval level scale
Often used to compare post-score to pre-score Independent variable (IV): The treatment or intervention Typical research question: Is there a mean difference between the post-score and pre-score?

Directional: Test if post-score (¬µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (¬µ1). H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â§ 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &gt; 0 Directional: Test if post-score (¬µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (¬µ1): H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â• 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &lt; 0 One Sample StatisticsOne-Sample Test
For negative emotion change (hypothesized to decrease), the one-sample t-test is significant, t(33) = -2.393, p = .011. The mean difference is -0.20 (negative emotion decreased after watching the video). The 95% upper confidence limit -.0585 below zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly smaller than 0).
For positive emotion change (hypothesized to increase), the one-sample t-test is significant, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The mean difference is 1.06 (positive emotion increased after watching the video). The 95% lower confidence limit .7809 above zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly greater than 0). tobs = d √∑ sd-bar or d √∑ (sd √∑ ‚àön) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - ¬µ0) (s √∑ ‚àön)
Where is ¬µ0? Given ùõº level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail(s).
Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; ùõº (SPSS) ùõº level is usually .05 (95% confidence level) Nondirectional: 100 (1 - ùõº)% CI: ¬± tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar ¬± tdf, ùõº/2 x (sd-bar √∑ ‚àön) To test greater (significant increase in post-scores): 100 (1 - ùõº)% LCL: - tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores): 100 (1 - ùõº)% UCL: + tdf, ùõº/2 x sd-bar DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS

Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. Paired Samples StatisticsPaired Samples CorrelationsPaired Samples Test
For negative emotion change: sd-bar = sd √∑ ‚àön = .48742 √∑ ‚àö34 = .08359

tobs = d-bar √∑ sd = 1.05882 √∑ .16422 = 6.448 Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to decrease (one-tailed test). H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â• 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &lt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = - .2000, SD sd = .48742, sd-bar = .08359
tobs = -2.393, df = 33, p = .011
Since the p-value (. 011) is smaller than the ùõº level (.05), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' negative emotion significantly decreased after watching the cat videos. Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to increase (one-tailed test). H0: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 ‚â§ 0 vs. H1: ¬µ2 - ¬µ1 &gt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = 1.05882, SD sd = .95754, sd-bar = .16422

For negative emotion change, Cohen's d (- 0.410) suggests a small to medium effect. For positive emotion change, the effect size (d = 1.106) is quite large. The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The results from the pre-test (M = 13.5, SD = 2.4) and post-test (M = 16.2, SD = 2.7) memory task indicate that the presence of caffeine in the bloodstream resulted in an improvement in memory recall, t(19) = 3.1, p = .006. There was a significant increase in the volume of alcohol consumed in the week after the end of semester (M = 8.7, SD = 3.1) compared to the week before the end of semester (M = 3.2, SD = 1.5), t(52) = 4.8, p &lt; .001

If your t-test is one-tailed, you need to say so. It's preferred to report the exact p-value unless it's smaller than .001. You need to state your alpha level (usually .05) early in the results section. If your p-value is smaller than .001, it's conventional simply to state p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)
Remember to drop the leading 0 from the p-value. No need to provide a formula for observed t in your paper. Observations are from a random sample, and the scores are independent of each other. Dependent variable of interest is measured on at least an interval scale. Difference scores (d's) are normally distributed. Typically considered robust to violations of non-normality, especially for big sample (n &gt; 30)
If one of the samples is highly skewed (particularly for a one-tailed test), a lot of error will tend to be built into the difference scores. Other non-parametric analyses would be better alternatives. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/lecture/7.-paired-sample-t-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/Educational Statistics 6641/Lecture/7.

Covariance sxy = (‚àëi = 1n (x1 - x-bar)(yi - y-bar)) √∑ n - 1 (ùúéxy for population)
Pearson correlation coefficient rxy = (sxy) √∑ (sxsy) (ùúåxy for population) The correlation reflects the noisiness and direction of a linear relationship, but not the slope of that relationship, nor many aspects of non-linear relationships. <img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).webp" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).webp" target="_self">
To test whether the sample correlation between x and y is significantly different from zero (non-directional): H0: ùúå = 0 vs. H1: ùúå ‚â† 0 Directional alternatives are also possible. Assumptions: <br><a data-href="Linearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/linearity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Linearity</a> The Pearson correlation assumes that the relationship among x and y is a linear relationship. Independence: Units or cases are randomly sampled from the population. tobs = r‚àö(n - 2) √∑ (1 - r2)

Reject H0 if tobs &gt; tcrit (or for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit)
Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; ùõº
APA Style Writing Template: A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the linear relationship between x and y. There was a (weak / moderate / strong negative / positive) correlation between x and y, r (df) = (p-value). Notice: No need to report t. tobs = r‚àö(n - 2) √∑ (1 - r2) = (. 698)‚àö (858 - 2) √∑ (1 - .698)2) ‚âà 28.52

APA Style Writing Template: There was a strong positive correlation between GPA and ACT, r (856) = .598, p &lt; .001. (Optional) Online calculators also available (section 3): <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.psychometrica.de/correlation.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.psychometrica.de/correlation.html" target="_self">Online-Calculator for testing correlations: Psychometrica</a> Restricting the range of scores on one or both variables will reduce the strength of a correlation. If the size of the standard deviation for one variable is reduced, everything else being equal, then the size of correlations with other variables will also be reduced. In other words, we need sufficient variation for a relationship to be evidenced through the correlation coefficient value.
HS GPA and ACT example: The strength of correlation between GPA and ACT will be lessened if we only focus on the graduates with summa cum laude (weighted GPA 4.2 or above). Correlation means the variables are related in some way, but correlations alone should not be used to infer cause. A high correlation between x and y might be a result of: x causes y
y causes x
A third variable z is causing both x and y (or even more variables are involved). Causality is not easy to prove. Application of complex statistical methods is not evidence for causality!
Causation (x -&gt; y) can only be inferred (formalized by the 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill) if: x proceeded y
x was related to y
We can find no other plausible alternative explanation for the effect on y other than x. Say we have data from 2 independent samples. We want to determine if the correlations between x and y are equal for these 2 independent samples. For example, is the correlation between GPA and ACT the same for Happy Valley HS (r = .654) and for Eureka HS (r = .765)? Happy Valley HS: r = .654
n = 155 Eureka HS: r = .765
n = 188 Hypotheses (Non-Directional): H0: ùúå1 - ùúå2 = 0 vs. H1: ùúå1 - ùúå2 ‚â† 0 Directional alternatives are also possible. Ranges of r is restricted so we use Fisher transformation to transform r1 and r2 to z1 and z2 respectively: <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation" target="_self">Fisher transformation - Wikipedia</a> z = (1/2) ln ((1+r) √∑ (1-r)) = artanh (r) 'ln' is the natural logarithm function

Can get p-value from z-table, Excel, or double the online calculator p-value (one-tailed)
Reject H0 and conclude that the correlation between GPA and ACT for Happy Valley (r = .654) is significantly different from the correlation for Eureka HS (r = .765), z = -2.064, p = .04. 'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ¬± .2 (weak)
r = ¬± .4 (moderate)
r = ¬± .8 (strong)
It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ¬± .1 (weak)
r = ¬± .3 (moderate)
r = ¬± .5 (strong) Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. You will learn regression models with multiple predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), in more advanced stats classes. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. <br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ‚âà .487
This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA. Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?

ùõΩ1: Slope (How much DV increases as IV increases by 1 unit) One statistician movie fan decided to use statistics to study the movie ratings in his favorite movie guide, Movie and Video Guide (1996), by Leonard Maltin. Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film. The statistician used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 100 movies rated by the Guide.

The slope is determined by the correlation between x and y with a scale of y per change in x. Analyze -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear
Define DV and IV (one IV for SLR)
Usually you'd already review descriptive statistics and correlations before running a regression, but you can also ask SPSS to report Descriptive in the Statistics option. Many other options are for MLR only. The default SPSS output has 3 sections: Model Summary (How much variance in DV is explained by the model)
ANOVA Table (Model significance)
Regression Coefficients (Equation for the regression line) Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts: What we can explain by the model (regression)
What we still cannot explain (error) Regression sum of squares (SSR)
Error Sum of Squares (SSE)
Total Sum of Squares (SSTO)
SSTO = SSR + SSE
SSR, SSE, and SSTO are available in the ANOVA table R2 indicates the proportion of variance in DV explained (accounted for) by the model, which can be considered the overall model fit. R2 = (SSR) √∑ (SSTO) = 1 - (SSE √∑ SSTO) = (Multiple R)2 In SLR, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation between x and y Multiple R is the correlation between yi and y-hati (always positive) In SLR, Multiple R = | rxy | <br><img alt="9.

Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually Œ±=.05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: Œ≤1 = 0
H1: Œ≤1 ‚â† 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: œÅ = 0 (œÅ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: œÅ &gt; 0
H0: œÅ2 = 0
H1: œÅ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; Œ±
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br><img alt="9.

Understand the bivariate regression in terms of the amount of error and the regression coefficients.

Effect size computation by comparing the sum of squared total (SST) and SSE The simple model (i.e., mean-only model) is not very informative and has a lot of error. Y = ùõΩ0 + ùúÄ Our model-building goal is to improve prediction and thereby reduce the error. To improve prediction and reduce error, we add a predictor variable (X) to the model. This enhanced model is the beginning of a 'predictive formula' that predicts individual outcome variable scores (Y) better than just predicting the mean. To use a bivariate regression model, identify two types of variables: <br><a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a>, or known variable (x)

The estimate of the population parameter, which we calculate using our sample data, is designated by the Arabic letter b. We can predict a person's score on an outcome (dependent) variable (Y-Hat) based on what we know about that person's score on a predictor (independent) variable (x). If variables x and y are related to each other, then adding x to our model improves prediction and produces less error (SSE) than the simple model generated. Here we have two competing models: You can use bivariate regression to answer the following questions about the pattern of data points and the significance of a linear equation: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?
Which equation of a straight line can best describe this pattern?
Are the predictions made from this equation significant? More questions using Bivariate Regression: What is the nature of the relation between x and y?

Do plots of residuals indicate violations of assumptions for bivariate linear regression? The error produced by Model C is the most error a parametric model can have. Thus, we often call this model as the simplest or null model.
<br>We call the sum of squared errors generated by Model C the <a data-href="Sum of Squares Total (SST)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares Total (SST)</a>.
We call the sum of squared errors by Model A SSEA. SST is almost always greater than SSEA. SST = SSEA + SSR Y-Hat = b0 + b1X Y-Hat: Predicted value of Y
b0: Intercept, the value of Y when X = 0. b1: Slope, the change in Y relative to the change in X. We actually never know the true population value of parameter Œ≤; we only estimate with our data. Yi = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1Xi + ùúÄi We will calculate b1 first. Determine b0 and using b1.

To estimate the error generated by this augmented model (SSEA) we need to Predict a score on Y for each subject. Find the difference between each subject's predicted and actual scores on Y.

Since the mean of Y was 6, ùõΩ0 = 6. The intercept, ùõΩ0, is the predicted value of Y when X is zero. Thus, if X has no meaningful value of 0, the estimated intercept is not informative. Centering the predictor of X to its mean can generate a better estimate because then the estimated ùõΩ0 is now the predictor value of Y when the predictor X is its mean. Think about the 1st year college CPA as the outcome (Y) predicted by the SAT score (X).

Understand what the data, model, and error are in GLM framework. Understand how to quantify the ERROR: Learn how to compute the <a data-href="Sum of Squares of Error (SSE)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/sum-of-squares-of-error-(sse).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares of Error (SSE)</a> <br>How to compute the variance and standard deviation (<a data-href="Standard Deviation (SD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviation-(sd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Standard Deviation (SD)</a>)

Data can refer to countless variables, scores, and sources of information
To understand a phenomenon, a behavioral scientist must first operationally define it as a measurable variable. Common descriptive statistics are the mean and standard deviation. Prediction is one way to demonstrate understanding of something. A model that predicts a phenomenon well implies that we understand that phenomenon. An initial model that predicts the mean for every subject serves as the foundation on which subsequent models are based. Y = ùõΩ0 + ùúÄ (Simplest model that we use) The single predictive component of the model () is designated as ùõΩ0.
Comparing the actual scores (Y) and the predicted scores reveals how much error exists in this simple model. Rarely would all of the scores on the dependent variable equal the mean. We study the error in our model in hopes that we can reduce the error to improve our model. To reduce the error, we must be able to measure error. <br><a data-href="Conceptual Formula" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/conceptual-formula.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Conceptual Formula</a> SSE = ‚àë (Yi - Y-Hati)2
It captures the concept of error by squaring and summing the differences between predicted and actual scores. It is a bit clumsy, especially when the mean is not an integer. <br><a data-href="Computational Formula" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/computational-formula.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Computational Formula</a> SSE = ‚àëY2 - (‚àëY)2 / N)
This is more convenient to compute SSE compared to the conceptual formula. Variance (S2) and standard deviation (S) describe the variation of scores around a mean. Variance is SSE divided by the number of scores minus 1: SSE / (N - 1)
Variance = Sy2 = (‚àëY2 - (‚àëY)2 / N)) / (N - 1) Since we squared the variable's scores to make them positive, we take the square root of the variance to return to the variable's score to return to the variable's origina; scale. The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation (S) We want to know whether the mean is statistically significantly different from 0. We use the one-sample t-test to examine whether Œº = 0

Criterion of judgement upon which a decision is made regarding the value stated in a null hypothesis. Typically the level is set at 5% in behavioral research studies. Compute the test statistic Test statistic Z-score How far a sample outcome is from the value stated in a null hypothesis
z = (x - M) / SD
zobt = (M - Œº) / œÉM
The z-score can be used to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis. The larger the value, the further a sample mean deviates from the population mean. T-score tobt = (M - Œº) / œÉM Make a decision Based on the probability of obtaining a sample mean, given that the value stated in the null is true (represented by p-value). Reject H0 The sample mean is associated with a low probability of occurrence. Retain (fail to reject) H0 The sample mean is associated with a high probability of occurrence. Statistical significance If z-statistic falls within 2 SE of M, sample mean is 'normal' (p &gt; 0.05)
If z-statistic falls outside 2 SE of M, sample mean is 'extreme' (p &lt; 0.05) <br><img alt="2.

A measure of the spread in a distribution derived from the sum of squared deviations from the mean of the distribution divided by the number of cases in the distribution. Since variance is a squared value, it is difficult to interpret. The standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance, and it is the most common measure of dispersion.

Going to have question about Dont forget to mention holding X
For every 1 unit increase in X1 , when holding X2 constant. The first coding scheme that we will use is contrast coding. Using contrast codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnoses is coded -1 The advantage of using the contrast codes is when the groups have equal N, the numerical values assigned to each group will sum to zero. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The estimated intercept coefficient (ùõΩ0) is the grand mean of outcome, Depression symptom score We will use the previous example with depression score as an outcome and the diagnosis variable as a predictor. Depression = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1Diagnosis + ùúÄ Using Contrast Codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnosis coded -1. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The sum of the new Diagnosis variable is 0. The intercept coefficient represents the mean of outcome (Dependent, y) (Depression) when the predictor (Independent, x) (Diagnosis) is 0, meaning that it is the mean for all subjects (grand mean). <a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a> and <a data-href="Outcome" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/outcome.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Outcome</a> The slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and the assigned group. <br><img alt="8.

13 (grand mean) + 6.5 (Difference between the grand mean and each group) x Diagnosis + ùúÄ Using Dummy Codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded 0 and another group is coded 1. Depressed are coded 1 and No. Diagnosis coded 0. The advantage of using the dummy codes is that it is very simple; only 0 and 1 are used. You choose a reference group to compare with other groups. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the mean for the 0 group (No Diagnosis) and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the reference group (coded as 0) and the comparison group (Depressed). Depressed are coded 1 and No Diagnosis coded 0. The intercept coefficient represents the mean of outcome (Depression) when the predict 2r (Diagnosis) is 0, meaning that it is the mean for No Diagnosis group. The slope coefficient represents the difference between the reference group (coded as 0) and the comparison group (coded as 1). <br><img alt="8.

Regression Model: Depression = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1Diagnosis + ùúÄ
6.5 (mean for the 0 group) + 13 (difference between the reference group [coded as 0] and the comparison group [depressed]) x Diagnosis + ùúÄ We will expand our statistical models by adding more predictors to explain the outcome variable. From the previous augmented model (Model A) with a single predictor X, we will now have two predictors (X1 and X2) in Model A. This model comparison tests whether a model with two predictors (X1 and X2) is better than a model that just predicts the mean for every person. H0: ùõΩ1 = ùõΩ2 = 0
If the null hypothesis is not rejected, neither X1 nor X2 are related to Y. The multiple regression model is called the 'omnibus model' given that both regression coefficients of ùõΩ1 and ùõΩ2 are simultaneously estimated and tested. We will use the same example data for Y and X1 from the bivariate regression to analyze the multiple regression model with the new variable X2. State the compact Model C and an augmented Model A. Identify the null hypothesis (H0). Count the number of parameters estimated by each model. Calculate the regression equation. Compute the total sum of squares (SSEC).
Compute the sum of squares for Model A (SSEA). Compute sum of squares reduced (SSR). Compute the proportional reduction in error (PRE or R2). Complete the summary table. Decide about H0. We use the data to estimate the regression equation for the omnibus Model A (Step 4). With bivariate regression, we easily calculated the regression coefficients (b0 and b1) by hand. We are not so lucky with multiple regression - or maybe we are very lucky, depending on your perspective. Although we could not compute the equation by hand, the formula consumes pages and would probably take an entire semester to calculate by hand (although admittedly I have only seen this equation once, during graduate school, and I have never tried to calculate a multiple regression by hand).

Standard Error se(b0) = ‚àöMSE (‚àö (1 √∑ n) + ‚àë( - )

The GLM is a basic framework underlying many statistical analyses. It is often expressed in a regression-type formula in which the expected value of a random dependent variable is given as a function of independent variables. The general linear model (GLM) is a way to simplify and combine multiple linear regression models into a single, unified format. It is not a different type of model but a more efficient way to represent them. General form: Y = XB + U
Data = Model + Error The key word is 'general.'
The GLM can be used to make predictions from various models. Depending on the outcome variable, logistic regression, ordinal regression, or count models (Poisson) may be used - these are also forms of the GLM.
Another term: Generalized Linear Models (GLIM) The GLM is actually a special case of (GLIM)!

The first coding scheme that we will use is contrast coding. Using contrast codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnoses is coded -1 The advantage of using the contrast codes is when the groups have equal N, the numerical values assigned to each group will sum to zero. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The estimated intercept coefficient (ùõΩ0) is the grand mean of outcome, Depression symptom score We will use the previous example with depression score as an outcome and the diagnosis variable as a predictor. Depression = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1Diagnosis + ùúÄ Using Contrast Codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnosis coded -1. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The sum of the new Diagnosis variable is 0. The intercept coefficient represents the mean of outcome (Depression) when the predictor (Diagnosis) is 0, meaning that it is the mean for all subjects (grand mean). The slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and the assigned group. <img alt="8.

It was predicted that students‚Äô anxiety scores would differ based on whether students were in the mindfulness intervention group (mindfulness) or the business as usual group (BAU). We first checked the normality of our data by calculating the skewness and kurtosis, visually examining histograms, and running Shapiro-Wilk‚Äôs test. The assumption of normality was upheld for both groups. The Shapiro-Wilk‚Äôs test was non-significant for both the mindfulness group, W(18) = .93, p = .17, and BAU group, W(18) = .94, p = .27. The skewness and kurtosis values were within acceptable rant for the mindfulness group (skewness = -0.10, kurtosis = -1.45) and the BAU group (skewness = 0.03, kurtosis = -1.34). Additionally, the assumption of homogeneity of variance was upheld by a non-significant Levene‚Äôs test (F(1, 34) = .61,&nbsp;p&nbsp;= .44), indicating that equal variances are assumed. The one-way ANOVA reached significance, F(1, 34) = 54.82, p &lt; .001, Œ∑2 = .62.

In hypothesis testing, a researcher's decision is based on a probability, depends on the level of significance for a hypothesis test, and can be to retain or reject the null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is also called significance testing. The criteria for a decision regarding the value stated in a null hypothesis is set by the level of significance. In hypothesis testing, a researcher can never prove that their hypothesis is correct. In Step 2 of hypothesis testing, researchers state a level of significance to minimize the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. The power of the decision-making process is the likelihood of rejecting a false null hypothesis. Effect Size allows researchers to describe a.) how far mean scores have shifted in the population or b.) the percentage of variance that can be explained by a given variable. A researcher reports that the size of an effect in some population is d = .88. What is an appropriate interpretation? Mean scores shifted .88 standard deviations in the population Increasing sample size will increase the power of the decision. The t-distribution is similar to the z-distribution except it is associated with greater variability, 'thicker' tails compared with the z-distribution, and is associated with scores being more likely in the tails of the distribution. Key difference between t-statistic and z-statistic is the standard error is estimated to compute a t-statistic. Assumption for computing any type of independent sample t-test Data in the population being sampled are normally distributed (Assumption of )
Data were obtained from a sample that was selected using a random sampling procedure
The probabilities of each measured outcome in a study are independent As a requirement for the t-test, researchers compute any type of t-test with samples selected from populations in which the population variance is unknown. To compute a sample t-test, a researcher must known the estimated standard error, sample size, sample mean, and sample variance. Matched Samples Design is a research design in which two or more groups of individuals are identical, or matching, in terms of the third variable. Repeated Measures Design is an experiment using a within-group design in which participants respond to a dependent variable more than once, after exposure to each level of the independent variable. What is the denominator of the test statistic for the related samples t-test? Estimated standard error for difference scores All other things being equal, as the degrees of freedom increase, what happens to the critical value for a related-samples t-test? The critical value decreases ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/midterm-1/glm-quizzes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/GLM 1/Midterm 1/GLM Quizzes.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 20:57:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.

Prediction is one way to demonstrate understanding of something. A model that predicts a phenomenon well implies that we understand that phenomenon. An initial model that predicts the mean for every subject serves as the foundation on which subsequent models are based. Y = ùõΩ0 + ùúÄ (Simplest model that we use) The single predictive component of the model () is designated as ùõΩ0.
Comparing the actual scores (Y) and the predicted scores reveals how much error exists in this simple model. Rarely would all of the scores on the dependent variable equal the mean. We study the error in our model in hopes that we can reduce the error to improve our model. To reduce the error, we must be able to measure error. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/model.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/GLM 1/Key Terms and Concepts/Model.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 22:54:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data]]></title><description><![CDATA[

If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. The 'average' squared deviation from the mean for a set of scores. Variance is a better measure of dispersion than range and IQR, because it takes into account all the values for a set of scores (but might be affected by extreme values). Conceptually, the variance is a measure of the area of the distribution (i.e., the more spread out the scores, the more area or space the distribution takes up). The sample mean might not be the same as the population mean (usually unknown), and the deviations would be affected. Therefore, sample variance obtained would be systematically too small. In order to get an unbiased sample estimate of the population variance, a slight change in the computational formula was made. AKA Degree of Freedom (df) When we calculate a simple statistic based in part on another statistic, we have to consider the 'degrees of freedom' in our calculation. Given the sample mean, we do not need raw data from all n observations. We only need (n-1) observations, because the last missing score can be found from the mean (i.e., there is no 'freedom' in what this score might be).
The denominator (n-1) in sample variance is called the degrees of freedom (df), which is related to sample size. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/GLM 1/Key Terms and Concepts/Variance.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 17:31:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[4.

In a sense, regression is taking correlation a step further. Correlation captures the strength and direction of a linear relationship. Regression goes beyond looking at just the linear relationship. We are interested in predicting one variance with another. y: Dependent/Outcome Variance (we would like to predict) x: Independent/Predictor Variable(s) We are predicting y from x y-hat = b0 + b1X y-hat: Outcome Variable (DV)
x: Predictor Variable (IV)
b1: Slope (Regression coefficient) r ((sx)/(sy)) b0: y-intercept Y-bar - b1 (x-bar) John had 80 men complete a self-concept inventory that contains five scales. Four scales involve questions about how competent respondents feel in the areas of intimate relationships, relationships with friends, commonsense reasoning and everyday knowledge, and academic reasoning and scholarly knowledge. The fifth scale includes items about how competent a person feels in general.
For this example, John is interested in conducting a regression analysis with the scale how competent respondents feel in relationship with friends as the predictor and the scale how competent they feel in general as the dependent variable. Descriptive Statistics
Friends: Skewness ratio: -. 552
Kurtosis Ratio: .021
Both skewness ratio and kurtosis ratio statistics are within +/- 2 range. Therefore, the distribution of friends would be considered normal. General: Skewness ratio: .004
Kurtosis Ratio: -. 721
Both skewness ratio and kurtosis ratio statistics are within +/- 2 range. Therefore, the distribution of general would be considered normal. Analyze -&gt; Correlate -&gt; Bivariate -&gt; drag VOIs into 'Variables' box Under 'Correlation Coefficients' select which type of correlation you want (Pearson)
Under 'Test of Significance' select which type of test you want, based on your hypothesis Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient Measures the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables
Example: Math and science scores of students Phi Coefficient Between two dichotomous variables
Gender (male, female)
Coin Flip (heads, tails) Cramer's V When variables have more than two categories
Political affiliation
Race Create the correlation table in SPSS and double click the table. Using the Pivot -&gt; Pivoting Trays menu, remove 'Statistics' from the 'Row' box and place it in the 'Layer' bod in the top left of this pop-out menu (the process we went over in class)
Click Format -&gt;TableLooks -&gt; select 'APA_TimesRoma_12 pt'
Copy and paste this 'cleaned' correlation table into Excel/Word. When pasting, use the 'Match Destination Format' option Center align the correlation coefficients and the column headers (the row headers remain left-aligned)
Delete the correlation coefficients above the diagonal
Number the variables along the left side of the correlation table
Replace the column header variable names with the corresponding numbers you just made. Replace the '1 s' that make up the diagonal with '-'
Place borders: Below the last row
Above and below the column headers Make sure the font is Times New Roman and the font size is 12. <img alt="9.

Correlation coefficients were computed among five self-concept scales. The results of the correlation analysis are presented in Table 1. The correlations of academic self-concept with other self-concept measures tend to be lower. The strongest correlation was between friends self-concept and intimate self-concept (r = .552). In research papers, correlations are typically discussed along with descriptive statistics, sometimes being reported within the same table. They are used to describe how the variables in your data relate to one another. Typically, correlations are just presented in a table, after (or with) the descriptive statistics. Having the legend of ** is common. Typically remove 'top diagonal' because the information is redundant
Sometimes the top and bottom diagonal will represent two groups (i.e., males and females)

Write conclusion Fred wishes to determine whether children in regular education are hurt or helped academically by the inclusion of special education students in their classes. He has gained the cooperation of the seventh-grade teachers in two similar junior high schools to participate in his study. One school recently integrated special education students into their regular classroom, while the other one has not. The teachers in both school supply Fred the students‚Äô raw scores on a standardized achievement test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year. SPSS file contains 40 cases and 3 variables: Integ (1: regular education students who are not in integrated classroom; 2. Regular education students who are in the integrated classroom)
Pretest (achievement test score of regular education students at the beginning of the year)
Posttest (achievement test score of regular education students at the end of the year) Research Questions: Are there any significant differences between the pre-test and post-test achievement scores? State the H0 and H1 H0: ùúápretest = ùúáposttest

Write conclusion A paired samples t-test was conducted to determine if there was a difference in the mean pretest and posttest achievement scores of regular education students. The test results indicated that, on average, the pretest achievement scores (M = 96.45, SD = 14.83) and posttest achievement scores (M = 103.03, SD = 18.53) were statistically different from each other (t(39) = -2.913, p = .006, d = -. 461). The null hypothesis that the pretest and posttest means were the same was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size d was -. 461. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as moderately small effect. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/labs/7.-paired-sample-t-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/Educational Statistics 6641/Labs/7.

Assumptions: The test variable is normally distributed in the population. The cases represent a random sample from the population. Scores on the test variables are independent of each other. State the H0 and H0
Define ‚ç∫ level
Compute t statistic
Look up critical value in t-table/interpret output
Make decision Reject or fail to reject the H0. Write conclusion Janet is interested in determining if depression scores of male adolescents who do not engage in sports are significantly different from the average male adolescent. To test this hypothesis, she obtains Kansas University Depression Inventory (KUDI) scores from 30 adolescent boys who have indicated on a questionnaire that they do not engage in sports outside of school gym classes. Past research has shown that the mean depression score for male adolescents in the population in the population is 50. Janet wants to determine if the mean KUDI score for the 30 adolescents is different from the value of 50. State the H0 and H1 H0: ùúá = 50
H1: ùúá ‚â† 50 Define ùõº level ùõº = .05 Compute t-statistic

One Sample Statistics:One-Sample Test:
tobs = 2.457
df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
tcrit = 2.045
Standard Error of the mean is: sy-bar = (sy) / ‚àön
10.327 / ‚àö30 = 10.327 / 5.477 = 1.8855 95% of the time, the true population mean difference will fall between .78 and 8.49
95% of the time, the true population mean will fall between 50.78 and 58.49.
t is the t-test statistic value t = 4.633 / 1.886 = 2.4565 The result of the t-test is significant (t = 2.457, df = 29, p = .020) at the ùõº = .05 significance level. Therefore, we reject H0. Take a look at the actual difference between the sample mean and the population mean: tobs = 2.457 vs. tcrit = 2.045
Are you comfortable calling that difference significant? Alternative (or Supplement) to significance value: Cohen's d Cohen's d is an effect size measure used to indicate the difference between two means. For one-sample t-test, d indicates how many standard deviations the sample mean is away from the hypothesized mean. If d = 1.0, the sample mean is one standard deviation away from the hypothesized mean. d = (x-bar - ùúá0) / s
d = t / ‚àön
Effect size measures strength of relationship:
One-Sample Effect Sizes
d = 2.457 / ‚àö30 = .4486
d = 4.633 / 10.327 = .4486 A lot of times before conducting your study you need to submit a power analysis. This lets you know what sample size you need to find an effect. Power is the probability that a test of significance will detect deviation from the null hypothesis if one truly exists. A Priori Power Determine how many cases you will need to have a good chance of detecting an effect of a specified size with the desired amount of power. Imagine you are designing a new study to see if depression scores are higher in a new group of students. Using alpha = .01, what sample size would you suggest to detect a 1/2 standard deviation difference from the population mean, with 90% power? In this example, we have one-tailed test. Effect size is 0.5, alpha level is 0.01 and the desired power is 0.90.
Based on these criteria, the required sample size for our one-sample t-test is 55. A Post Hoc Power Determine how much power you would have if you had a specified number of cases. In SPSS example (Kudi), we have a two-tailed test. The observed effect size was 0.449. The alpha level we tested was 0.05, and the actual sample size was 30. Based on these criteria, the power hoc power is 0.662 A one sample t-test was conducted on the KUDI scores to evaluate whether their mean was significantly different from 50, the mean for male adolescent in general. The sample mean of 54.63 (SD = 10.33) was significantly different from 50, (t (29) = 2.46, p = .02). The 95% confidence interval for the KUDI mean ranged from 50.78 to 58.49. The effect size d of .45 indicates a medium effect (Cohen, 1988). The post hoc power of the test, given the sample size, two-tailed, alpha level, and observed effect size, was .662 (M = 54.63, SD = 10.33).

Comparison of univariate and multivariate control data Control charts are used to routinely monitor quality. Depending on the number of process characteristics to be monitored, there are two basic types of control charts. The first, referred to as a univariate control chart, is a graphical display (chart) of&nbsp;one&nbsp;quality characteristic. The second, referred to as a multivariate control chart, is a graphical display of a statistic that summarizes or represents&nbsp;more than one&nbsp;quality characteristic. Characteristics of control charts If a single quality characteristic has been measured or computed from a sample, the control chart shows the value of the quality characteristic versus the sample number or versus time. In general, the chart contains a center line that represents the mean value for the in-control process. Two other horizontal lines, called the upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL), are also shown on the chart. These control limits are chosen so that almost all of the data points will fall within these limits as long as the process remains in-control. The figure below illustrates this. <img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power 1.gif" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-1.gif" target="_self">
Why control charts "work" The control limits as pictured in the graph might be 0.001&nbsp;probability&nbsp;limits. If so, and if chance causes alone were present, the probability of a point falling above the upper limit would be one out of a thousand, and similarly, a point falling below the lower limit would be one out of a thousand. We would be searching for an assignable cause if a point would fall outside these limits. Where we put these limits will determine the risk of undertaking such a search when in reality there is no assignable cause for variation.
Since two out of a thousand is a very small risk, the 0.001 limits may be said to give practical assurances that, if a point falls outside these limits, the variation was caused be an assignable cause. It must be noted that two out of one thousand is a purely arbitrary number. There is no reason why it could not have been set to one out a hundred or even larger. The decision would depend on the amount of risk the management of the quality control program is willing to take. In general (in the world of quality control) it is customary to use limits that approximate the 0.002 standard.
Letting&nbsp;X&nbsp;denote the value of a process characteristic, if the system of chance causes generates a variation in&nbsp;X&nbsp;that follows the normal distribution, the 0.001 probability limits will be very close to the 3œÉ&nbsp;limits. From normal tables we glean that the 3œÉ&nbsp;in one direction is 0.00135, or in both directions 0.0027. For normal distributions, therefore, the 3œÉ&nbsp;limits are the practical equivalent of 0.001 probability limits. Plus or minus "3 sigma" limits are typical In the U.S.,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;X&nbsp;is normally distributed or not,&nbsp;it is an acceptable practice to base the control limits upon a multiple of the standard deviation. Usually this multiple is 3 and thus the limits are called 3-sigma limits. This term is used whether the standard deviation is the universe or population parameter, or some estimate thereof, or simply a "standard value" for control chart purposes. It should be inferred from the context what standard deviation is involved. (Note that in the U.K., statisticians generally prefer to adhere to probability limits.)
If the underlying distribution is skewed, say in the positive direction, the 3-sigma limit will fall short of the upper 0.001 limit, while the lower 3-sigma limit will fall below the 0.001 limit. This situation means that the risk of looking for assignable causes of positive variation when none exists will be greater than one out of a thousand. But the risk of searching for an assignable cause of negative variation, when none exists, will be reduced. The net result, however, will be an increase in the risk of a chance variation beyond the control limits. How much this risk will be increased will depend on the degree of skewness.
If variation in quality follows a Poisson distribution, for example, for which&nbsp;np&nbsp;= 0.8, the risk of exceeding the upper limit by chance would be raised by the use of 3-sigma limits from 0.001 to 0.009 and the lower limit reduces from 0.001 to 0. For a Poisson distribution the mean and variance both equal&nbsp;np. Hence the upper 3-sigma limit is 0.8 + 3&nbsp;sqrt(0.8) = 3.48 and the lower limit is 0 (here&nbsp;sqrt&nbsp;denotes "square root"). For&nbsp;np&nbsp;= 0.8 the probability of getting more than 3 successes is 0.009. Strategies for dealing with out-of-control findings If a data point falls outside the control limits, we assume that the process is probably out of control and that an investigation is warranted to find and eliminate the cause or causes.
Does this mean that when all points fall within the limits, the process is in control? Not necessarily. If the plot looks non-random, that is, if the points exhibit some form of systematic behavior, there is still something wrong. For example, if the first 25 of 30 points fall above the center line and the last 5 fall below the center line, we would wish to know why this is so. Statistical methods to detect sequences or nonrandom patterns can be applied to the interpretation of control charts. To be sure, "in control" implies that all points are between the control limits and they form a random pattern. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/control-charts.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Statistics Classes/Educational Statistics 6641/Key Terms and Concepts/Control Charts.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 04:05:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-1.gif" length="0" type="image/gif"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-1.gif"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[6.

When we assume normality, we assume the distribution of sample means is normal. Look for extreme departures from normality. Checking for Normal Distribution
Looking for extreme departures from normality. Skewness: A measure of symmetry (lack of symmetry) Type of Skewness: Positive Skew Mode &lt; Median &lt; Mean Negative Skew Mode &gt; Median &gt; Mean Distributions with medium kurtosis (medium tails) are mesokurtic.
Distributions with low kurtosis (thin tails) are platykurtic.
Distributions with high kurtosis (fat tails) are leptokurtic.

Skewness Ratio: Skewness √∑ Standard Error Kurtosis Ratio: Kurtosis √∑ Standard Error If these values are between -2 and 2, we are good. In SPSS: Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Frequencies -&gt; Move the variables of interest into the variable box -&gt; click 'Charts' -&gt; select 'Histograms' and click 'Show normal curve on histogram' If data points fall along the straight line, the data appears to be normally distributed. If the data points considerably deviate from the line, the data appears NOT be normally distributed. In SPSS: Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Explore -&gt; Move the Variables of Interest into the 'dependent list' box -&gt; Plots -&gt; Check option 'Normality plot with tests'
Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Q-Q plots -&gt; move the variables of interest into the 'variable' box. Z-Score: Distance from the mean in standard deviation units. Indicates how much a given value differs from the mean. A positive z-score indicates the raw score is higher than the mean average. For example, if a z-score is equal to +1, it is 1 standard deviation above the mean. A negative z-score reveals the raw score is below the mean average. For example, if the z-score is equal to -2, it is 2 standard deviations below the mean. It standardizes the distribution so that M = 0 and SD = 1. If data normally distributed: Sample

A 'horiculture wagon' was pushed into the lake as a Halloween prank. "With the exception of running the caissons over the campus and dumping the Horticulture wagon in the lake, the students were as quiet as could be," The Lantern read on November 6th, 1895. "To guard against trouble the street car authorities had heavy guards at the end of the Neil avenue line and on High street near the University. They were entirely unnecessary, no trouble whatever occurring." <br>Mirror Lake Islands:<img alt="1898 Mirror Lake.jpg" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/mirror-lake/1898-mirror-lake.jpg" target="_self"> First reference of freshmen being thrown into the lake.

Mirror Lake Bridge (Two Men on Bridge) (1915): Windstorm Damage (1918): Snow Scene:
But 1920 is when it seems the tradition became more serious with approval from student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step foot on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson Library. Only assigned enforcers, members of the Bucket and Dipper club, were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. 1922, the Lantern reported members of Bucket and Dipper would even defend freshmen from being dunked in the lake by those who were not permitted to do so, i.e. non-Bucket Dipper members. "Bucket and Dipper announces that no promiscuous 'ducking' or 'dipping' is to take place under the auspices of other organizations. Any attempt to haze freshmen in this manner by other organizations will result in Bucket and Dipper's strong-arm squad defending the freshmen."
The student council rejected alternatives to the dunking in Mirror Lake put forth by faculty members.
1922 was the last tug-of-war across Mirror Lake. University president said, "The University is trying to make the lake a place of as much beauty as possible." 1926: Freshmen got fed up with dunking into Mirror Lake and planned an event to burn the hats they were forced to wear. A huge fight ensued and police were called to the scene. Sophomore was hospitalized. 1929: "For all practical purposes, freshmen rules are already a thing of the past. Although several attempts have been made to revive the freshmen taboos, and particularly the cap-wearing tradition, the rules have been virtually non-existent since Bucket and Dipper was shorn of its power to enforce them." Mirror Lake Fountain (1931): 1942: Tug-of-war made another appearance for tradition week and stuck around for May week in following years. Ariel View (1947): Mirror Lake (1950s):
Last known reference of tug-of-war across the lake. In 1955, references to dunking popped back up in a Lantern editorial with the following reasons given for dunking: honorary initiates, fraternity seniors, pinned or engaged couples and any other willing soul. Mirror Lake facing North East (1961): 1964: An engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. 1967: Last reference of Bucket and Dipper initiating members by dunking them in Mirror Lake.

Satir wrote one of the first books about family therapy, Conjoint Family Therapy, in which she provided transcripts of how she worked. Every person has resources available to them, but when troubled, they do not usually utilize these resources to their utmost abilities.

Each part is interconnected. The less these 8 areas are given energy and time, the lower a person's self-esteem. <br>When people experience low self-esteem, they attempt to cope by using <a data-href="Survival Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Survival Stances</a>. These stances help people temporarily deal with presumed threats and protect their self-worth. The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive. The four survival stances are: <br><a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>: Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. The placating stance discounts self and privileges the other person and the context. <br><a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a>: Privileges self and context while discounting the other. To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.
Their experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. <br><a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>: Privileges the context and discounts the self and others. Focuses on the rules rather than on emotions and relationships. Very data driven and people appreciate them for their intellect. To offset their internal vulnerability, the super-reasonable person doesn't allow themselves to connect with any emotions. This can lead to a rigidness that may be displayed via obsessive-compulsive behaviors. <br><a data-href="Irrelevant (Distractor)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a>: Discounts self, other, and context. Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. <br>The goal of Satir's therapy is to help people enhance their own and others' self-esteem. When we do so, we function from a <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication stance. This is the healthiest position we can operate from. The Satir Growth Model is a strength-based approach, focusing on the existing resources that family members bring with them. Faulty coping strategies maintain problematic interactions. Therapy provides a safe space for people to choose alternative ways of coping. Therapy increases people's self-esteem, leading them to be able to lean into their uniqueness and provide a space for their loved ones to feel comfortable in their own uniqueness as well. Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic. (Congruence) Self-Esteem Maintenance Kit: Detective Hat: Used when there is something new that the person wants to understand better. It helped them shift away from judging an experience to exploring it. Medallion: Two-sided and says 'yes' on one side and 'no' on the other. It is intended to help the person recognize that they can say either word, depending on what they truly want, so they can maintain their integrity. Wand (Empowering wand, courage stick, wishing wand): Helps people move from inaction based on fear to action based on desire. Golden Key: Opens any door - helping the person ask questions they might not have previously, so the unsayable, and do the undoable. Wisdom Box: Helps connect the person to the wider world and all that has come before them. <br>Experiential therapists are interactive in the therapy room. They try to use their whole self for contact. This includes adopting an <a data-href="I-Thou Perspective" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">I-Thou Perspective</a>, where they try to promote human-to-human interaction. Since one of the main goals of therapy is to help the client become more congruent, it is important for the therapist to engage the client congruently. The therapist must be a real person who helps model a way of being for the client. Experiential therapists conceptualize a few main processes: Status Quo: The family is currently in this process, and is leading to difficulties bringing them to therapy. Foreign Element: The family's expression of the desire to change. Chaos: The therapist's introduction of novelty into the system. Integration: Family members put what they learn from therapy into practice. Practice: Involves trying out these learnings. New Status Quo:
- New homeostasis takes hold.<br>

Therapy then helps people to allow others to be more authentic. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Sculpting helps people get in touch with their inner experience and express this experience to others in a way that bypasses the typical spoken word. Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways: The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another. <br><a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a>: Designed to help an individual connect better to the historical and psychological interconnections of their family. By seeing self and family of origin with a new perspective, the individual might then feel more freedom to engage in new possibilities for the future. <br><a data-href="Star" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Star</a>: The person whose relationship with the family is being explored and worked on. <br>The therapist prepares the reconstruction by talking with the star about their family history. This involves developing a <a data-href="Family Map" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-map.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Map</a>, or the primary family that can include the grandparents, a <a data-href="Family Life Chronology" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-life-chronology.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Life Chronology</a>, highlighting three generations of the star's family, including important dates and historical events (similar to the genogram), and the <a data-href="Wheel of Influence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/wheel-of-influence.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wheel of Influence</a>, a chart including all the people who influenced the star when they were growing up. The therapist ('guide') begins the family reconstruction by telling the star's story; then sculpts the family of origin, the star's parents' families of origin, and the star's parents' relationship; and then resculpts the star's family of origin. The overall goal is to increase the star's self-esteem so they are empowered to engage with themselves and others in new and more productive ways. This should engender more hope in them for their future. <br><a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>: Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes. "The Growth Model," where the focus was on helping people access their inner resources as opposed to, "The Medical Model," where the emphasis was on pathology and symptom reduction. <br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. "The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341) Her goals for family therapy included helping the individual members increase their sense of worth and value by accessing their inner resources and by decreasing any emotional blocks. And for the family as a whole, she saw the goal as being to increase congruent communication and heart connections. She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.
It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
It is not okay to ask for what you want.
It is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: "What do you see going on between your and your ?"
"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family." <br>She also helped them to make better connections with each other by decreasing their defensiveness. Satir identified the primary defensive stances as <a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a>, <a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>, <a data-href="Distracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distracting</a>, and being <a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>.

Emotionally Withdrawing (Physically present but not emotionally present.)
Physically Withdrawing (Leaving the room or hanging up on someone.)
Cutting-Off (Refusing to talk to the other for days or longer.) Within a family system, these defenses can be played out in interactional patterns such as: Blame - Blame
Blame - Withdraw
Placate - Placate
Blame - Placate
Blame - Distract
Withdraw - Withdraw Satir developed a process for helping people change and become more connected. Her process is described as having six phases: Phase 1 - Making Contact Satir would reach out using her body position, eye contact, and facial expression to make contact with each member. She would also consciously work to connect from her spirit to theirs. Phase 2 - Validating Satir worked to help people feel validated in many ways such as reflecting their feelings, affirming their values and highlighting their inner resources. Examples include: "You feel scared because your son got suspended from school."
"You value education."
"You are courageous to seek help." Phase 3 - Facilitating Awareness Satir had many different ways that she would attempt to bring awareness to a family about their defensive patterns in a non-blaming way. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Satir placed the members in body positions to give them a picture of their defensive behavior. For the blaming stance, she would position the person leaning toward another and pointing at them and for the placating stance, she would position the person down on one knee with their head down and their hand up in a pleading position. Satir would also bring awareness to members by exploring their inner experiences. She used the metaphor of an iceberg to help the family therapist to conceptualize the inner level so experience driving defensive behaviors. Above the water line were the inner levels of experience such as feelings, perceptions, expectations, beliefs, and yearnings. (What meaning are you giving to what your ___ said that is causing you to feel hurt? Is that a familiar place for you to go to when someone is disappointed in you? What is it you yearn for?) Phase 4 - Promoting Acceptance One of the ways that satir promoted acceptance was through 'normalizing,' that is, reassuring the family member that what they were experiencing was normal. ("It is normal to...")
Another way that she promoted acceptance was by 'bridging' between conflicting parties. ("I am hearing that is is not easy for _, I would be interested to know how life was for you when you were their age?") Phase 5 - Eliciting Positive Choices and Changes Once Satir observed that the family members were aware of and accepting of their unhelpful patterns, she would lead them into seeing new possibilities for their interactions. After sculpting the family, she would ask them to each to stand in a balanced way and look at each other. She would then guide them in a dialogue helping them to express themselves in non-defensives ways. Other times she would simply have them sit face to face and she would guide the dialogue between them. "What happens for you when your says you choose over your ? You feel... Did you know that your felt __? What happened for you when you heard them express their feelings? You long to be more connected with them. You miss them. How do you feel to hear how much they miss you?" Phase 6 - Reinforcing Change Satir would often combine verbal responses with some supportive touch to reinforce a positive shift. The therapist also needs to work on their own personal growth. This is true for working with individuals but it is even more true when working with families as the chances of being triggered by your own family experience are even greater. As Satir used to say, "You are the most important instrument in the room!" Under threat and reward, change is painful: change is viewed as unnatural, the unknown is feared, the status quo is maintained, life's natural 'flow' is blocked, and the familiar is valued despite discomfort. The seed model has people viewing change more positively; as naturally occurring at a variety of levels (from cellular to cosmic) and as scary, but offering new opportunities. Discomfort is seen as a signal for change. Therapists using the seed model keep in mind that families entering therapy are problem-focused and will maintain the status quo as a necessary survival behavior. Therapist should make contact with each person to communicate a climate of acceptance (e.g., people do the best they can) and hear them out to discover 'what is.'
Understanding the status quo stage is essential to clarify how the change process gets started or is blocked. This stage is explored further by examining resistance and readiness concepts in detail. The coin of change has resistance and readiness as its head and tail sides. Experientially, we may want to change in one moment and fear or sabotage it in the next. Then status quo is considered a trance, accounting for change resistance as well as a medium in which change may be fostered. Changing circumstances elicit shifts in perception, which in turn stimulate changes in thinking, feeling, and acting. But when circumstances shift back, behavior also reverts. Perception can appear to create change of behavior when the meaning of an event is reframed, but the underlying pattern is not altered. Altering the underlying pattern requires dealing with resistance to change. Resistance is a coping behavior intended to preserve the organism rather than obstruct change. Reframing resistance in terms of its positive intention. The way we are socialized has us, "Gradually acquiring a variety of commitments which constrain the person into following a consistent pattern of behavior." The effect is to develop a lifestyle that stabilizes the events in our lives, our interdependence of meaning of these events, and the way we define ourselves, as well as predisposing us to seek consistent situations. Experientially, change involves invoking the unfamiliar. Intellectualizing, avoiding feelings, compulsive activity, impatience about change, and dwelling in the past are all ways of dealing with the confusion by maintaining the status quo. The tasks at this stage are to cope with the threat to past security and sense of competence and self-esteem; deal with feelings of loss and longing for the past.
Conservative impulse, the will to change has to overcome an impulse to restore the past, to resist the change. Survival depends on this impulse. By stabilizing perceptions, the conservative impulse enhances the ability to learn from experience. Only when it does not fit this construct is its 'newness' experienced. <br><a data-href="Readiness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/readiness.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Readiness</a> refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>. Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain. Four patterns emerge reflecting the relative influence of these readiness factors. These patters are based on the degree of difficulty involved in making the change and the degree of responsibility the person is wiling to take for making the change. <br><a data-href="Preemptive Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preemptive Change</a>: This pattern describes 'overnight' change. The inordinate strength of the motivating influences lowers the degree of difficulty in making the change. The degree of responsibility for the change is also low. The change in circumstances preempts issues of loss (leaving family and friends), self-efficacy ("Can I do it?"), and self-esteem ("Am I worth the effort?") that are ordinarily addressed in making changes. Problems maintaining the change may require attention at a later point in the change process. Change literally 'happens' to us in this pattern, but we have little sense of ownership of it. <br><a data-href="Self-Managed Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Managed Change</a>: In this pattern, the influences motivating the change are less extreme or immediate than those noted in the preemptive patter. The person is influenced to take a conscious and self-responsible approach to change and is required to deal with one or more of the issues of loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in order to resolve the resistance to change. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" target="_self">Satir Family Therapy - YouTube</a> Experiential family therapies include four approaches: <br><a data-href="Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)</a>

Logic and rules reign supreme
Therapists must refer to context to gain validity
Therapist should understand the logic and/or rules they use to organize their world. Therapists may need to refer to this context in order to gain validity. It is important to understand the logic of the system, but at the same time bringing in recognition and value to their own needs AND the needs and desires of others are valid.

The class clown. When tension rises in a relationship, they distract with humor or something off-topic. They may distract. They are more likely to see this in schizophrenia. Your job as a therapist is to get the client reengaged with the difficult topic that they would prefer to just avoid in one way or another. Minimizes self, others, and context.
No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Must increase ability to recognize thoughts and feelings of self and others.
The focus for the therapist is on creating safety. Help them learn to recognize, and not be afraid of their thoughts and the thoughts of others. Stances acknowledge or minimize three realities: Self
Other
Context When we feel unsafe, we revert back to one of these communication stances. These are the stances used when someone is frightened. When we don't feel safe as children, we evolve communication stances to survive when we do not feel safe when we are young. You can use the communication stances to help better understand how to intervene, or how to communicate with your client. When you are working with a placator, be cautious if you are going to be making a suggestion it may help to give options. "Which do you think is the best fit or might work for you?" Ask them to give voice to their thoughts and opinions because they will be very quick even to please the therapist. Their task us to learn to assert themselves in a healthy way, how can they assert their needs so that they don't become resentful, depressed (needs do not get taken care of because they are not advocating for themselves) Therapy involves going through stages several times. Can be a new way of looking at the interactions and how to communicate in a more congruent way. The family is having to deal with this foreign element, this new way of interacting, this new idea, or new beliefs, this learning to tolerate direct emotional expression, etc. <br>That disrupts the family's <a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a> Eventually the family integrates the new foreign element. People naturally tend toward positive growth
All people possess the resources for positive growth
Everything impacts and is impacted by everything else. Therapy is a process involving interaction between therapist and client; each person is responsible for themselves. Therapeutic presence (warmth and humanity)
Making contact Making emotional contact. About real contact with the person at an intimate level. Contacting them in a very intimate, authentic, engaged way. Empathy
Conveying hope
Establishing credibility You must instill the hope to clients you can be helpful for them. Emotional Role of Symptom Symptom has a role in the family system Example: Child's exaggerated acting out may serve to reduce tension in marriage by getting parents on the same page. If the therapist can understand how symptom makes emotional sense, it will be easier to help find ways to interact successfully. Problematic family dynamics typically involve: Power struggles
Parental conflicts
Lack of validation
Lack of intimacy Each person's role in family is assessed to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles: Martyr
Victim or helpless one
Rescuer
Good child/parent
Bad child/parent Timeline that includes major events in individual's or family's life. Births and deaths
Important family events: Marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss Important historical events: Wars, natural disasters, economic downturns Gives both the therapist and client insight into the context of the problem as well as strengths and resources might exist. Child, mother, and father and quality of relationship between them. In this primary triad a child learns how to be human. The triad should serve as nurturing system for child. When the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. Layers of the iceberg: Behavior (Top Layer)
Coping (Above)
Feelings (Below) that are related to coping
Perceptions, how is the person perceiving their life or how do they make meaning?
Expectations, what are the expectations that are fueling all of this
Yearnings (what are the primal yearnings) Helps clients transform their feelings about feelings to make change. Helps clients observe and evaluate themselves. Considers aspects of the self that the client values and aspects of which they are ashamed
Self-Compassion: Better indicator of happiness than self-esteem As self-compassion and self-worth rise, Become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses. What extent does the client value themselves? How emotional issues may be manifesting in the body, either symbolically or functionally
The way the body is used indicates a person's communication stance: <br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> Communication: Open and relaxed body postures <br><a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a> Timid and reserved postures <br><a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>: Cold and distant postures <br><a data-href="Irrelevant (Distractor)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a>: Hyper and distracted The goal is transformation Achieve optimal realization of a person's full potential Two sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relationally-focused goals: Congruent communication Individual-focused goals: Self-actualization Therapist's self The way the therapist is in the room. Ingredients of an interaction Whenever the therapist is talking with clients about difficult situations and interactions with others, they ask a series of questions. Go back to the iceberg. What do I hear and see? What is happening at the behavioral level without any interpretation. What are the meanings I make of this? What are they saying? What feelings do I have about these meanings I am making? What feelings do I have about those feelings? What defenses do I use/am I using? How does this trigger me and what kind of defensive behaviors might I bring, that makes them ‚Ä¶. ?
What are the rules within the system about how to comment about what's going on? What is allowed and what is appropriate? How am I responding and what part do I play in the system? Facilitating emotional expression What is allowed and what is appropriate? What is my response and what am I doing in this situation?
Congruent expression, without the communication stances, turn chairs to each other directly, hold hands, make eye contact Softening family rules When families have rigid rules about who can say what, when, where, and how, she will soften some of these to create more space for everyone's particular way of communicating in a comfortable way to hopefully reduce the use of communication stances. Communication enhancement Helping each member of the family learn to communicate congruently in stressful circumstances, even when they do feel threatened by their partner or their child, Rather than reverting to a survival stance, to help them learn how to be fully congruent and present and to have more effective communications. Sculpting or spatial metaphor She would position each person in the family to metaphorically represent their role. (Example: A placator may be sculpted as being on their knees and begging, the blamer may be there pointing their finger angrily at someone, the irrelevant type might be in a strange position far off from everybody else, the super-reasonable might be sitting there in a very cold, distant, "I am citing the rulebook")
Because it is more visual than verbal - you can add a verbal element to it by having each person say a motto of theirs (eg., "Please be nice to me," "Do what I say," "Follow the rules,") - that represents their position in the family. It can push past the survival stances, intellectual defenses, the family could sculpt themselves.
It can be a powerful intervention. Touch Touch clients, help clients learn to hold and touch each other in nurturing ways, The therapist must be aware of cultures that have different attitudes towards emotional expression. The therapist adjusts to the client's level of intimacy. Used commonly in the LGBTQ community Focus is on the burden of societal rejection when being the authentic self. Combined main ideas from systemic and humanistic theories: Targeting emotional transactions from the interactional pattern
Therapists use warmth, empathy, and self to facilitate desired change. Communication Stances: Give the therapist sense of how to most effectively communicate with the client. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/Sz3RjPg7Y-k?si=2iorth3vBwpc_4Ps" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/Sz3RjPg7Y-k?si=2iorth3vBwpc_4Ps" target="_self">Satir Family Therapy | Part 1 - YouTube</a> Satir brought an unparalleled warmth and enthusiasm for human potential Focused on: Fostering individual growth

Making Contact: Begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self in the self-mandala. Therapist works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other. Convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing empathy
Having empathy does NOT mean that a therapist: Takes the client's side
Avoids confronting inconsistencies
Ignores the client's responsibility Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it Makes it easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience, which is 'true' for that person Family Functioning: Role of symptom

Attention to individual goals reflects their humanistic foundations 2 broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Systemic/family goals
Individual goals Relational Goal: Congruent communication Communicating authentically while responding to the needs of self and others Goal to help the family develop ways for members to communicate so the system's homeostasis does not need the symptoms Overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote self-actualization Self-Actualization: Fulfilling one's potential and living an authentic and meaningful life. Specific Goal Example: Increase sense of self-worth and self-compassion
Reduce defensiveness and use of survival stances Therapists' use of self Being authentically who they are is one of the most essential interventions in Satir's approach
Creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently Ingredients of an interaction: Details the internal communication process
Teaches clients about internal and relational processes Ingredient Questions: Used to help people better understand their interactions with others
Can be used with individuals, couples, or families Walk the client through the ingredients of an interaction: What do I hear and see?
What meanings do I make of what I hear and see?
What feelings do I have about the meanings I make?
What feelings do I have about these feelings?
What defenses do I use?
What rules for commenting do I use?
What is my response to the situation? Facilitating Emotional Expression Help put difficult emotions into words
Naming emotions
Locating in body

Puts family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family
Bypassing Denial/Resistance: Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses Satir used touch in therapy to: Connect with clients
Encourage and reassure clients when they were practicing new ways of communicating In today's environment: Touching less common because it can easily be misinterpreted as harassment Carefully consider trauma history, culture, gender, legal/ethical issues of using touch
Coaching clients to touch each other Experiential therapies can be challenging online. Require attending to emotions and affect, which are communicated non-verbally Requires Using more verbal communication to make up for the loss of non-verbal communication

The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive. Privileges self and context while discounting the other. To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.
Their experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. Assert their needs and desires while minimizing those of others. You will find placator and blamer married in therapy because their stances are complimentary. Your job as a therapist is to help blamer to learn how to acknowledge and develop empathy for the thoughts and needs of others. Needs to increase awareness of others' thoughts and feelings

Direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. Blaming (Blamer)

This is a 'yes man' who talks as though they could do nothing for themselves; they must always get someone's approval. They may experience feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit during conflict or disagreement. You may think of yourself as really worth nothing. You are lucky just to be allowed to eat. You owe everybody gratitude, and you really are responsible for everything that goes wrong. Naturally, you will agree with any criticism of you. You are grateful that anyone even talks to you, no matter what they say or how they say it. You would not think of asking anything for yourself. After all, who are you to ask? Besides, if you can just be good enough, it will come by itself. Think of yourself as being physically down on one knee, wobbling a bit, and putting out one hand in a begging fashion. Keep your head up so your neck will hurt, your eyes will strain, and in no time at all your head will ache. When you talk in this position, your voice Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. Acknowledge Other/Context Minimizes self (sometimes context)
People-pleasing tendencies Therapeutic Implications: Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs
Assertiveness/clear communication of needs
Less directive therapy methods
Multiple choice options to practice sense of agency Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. Placating (Placator)
<br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. "The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities."

She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.
It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
It is not okay to ask for what you want.
It is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: "What do you see going on between your and your ?"
"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family." Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes. Parts Party
Being authentically who they are is one of the most essential interventions in Satir's approach. Creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently. This is the cohnitive part of your brain. This lens tells you about the information you take in, the thoughts you have, and the meaning you give them. From this cognitive and rational part, you can get answers to such questions as, "What do I understand? How do I learn new things? How do I analyze situations and solve problems?"

This is the physical body with all its parts and systems.
Find a good anatomy book in which you can see pictures of your bones, muscles, internal organs, together with all the different systems. Let yourself be awed and amazed at how wonderfully your body is engineered and what a treasure house of resources it contains. Apply this information to your own body. Are you, its owner, meeting its needs? Are you listening to it? It will tell you when you are tired, hungry, or over-stressed, or alert you to any part of you that needs special care. This is that of your emotions, your feelings. How free are you to recognize and acknowledge them? What restrictions do you put on your feelings? How do you express them?
All feelings are human. They bring texture, color, and sensitivity to life. Without feelings, we would be robots. Your feelings about these feelings show you where your self-worth is in relation to your feelings. This has to do with your spiritual connection. This represents your relationship to your life force. How do you regard your life? Do you honor it? Do you use your spiritual connection in your daily life? This has to do with your context. This refers to the sights and sounds, the feel of things, the temperature, the light, the color, the quality of air, and the space where you live and work. Each of these factors has an important effect on your life. The individual is at the center, and surrounding them are the eight universal human resources: spiritual, contextual, nutritional, interactional, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and physical. Each part is interconnected. The less these 8 areas are given energy and time, the lower a person's self-esteem. <br>This has to do with nutrition. What kind of food and drink do you put into your body?

This lets you know how you sense yourself. What is the physical condition of your sense organs? What freedoms do you give yourself to look, hear, touch, taste, and smell?
Many of us were taught that we could only look at, touch, or listen to certain things. That often resulted in limiting our use of our senses. To acknowledge, honor, and fully and freely use our senses is the main way we interact with the outside world and stimulate ourselves internally. Diagnostic Assessment This shows how you interact with the people in your world. Your interaction shapes the nature of your relationships. How do you evaluate the quality of your various relationships? How do you use your power? Do you give it away and become a victim? Do you use it to become a dictator? Do you use it to develop harmony within yourself and with others, thus becoming an empowering leader? Do you use your power to nurture yourself or others, or to threaten? Do you team up with family members of others to do things together? Do you have fun, make jokes, and generally use good humor to make your life and that of others lighter and happier? Remember that humor and love are two very powerful healing forces. "Making Contact" Joining and building alliance

One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families usually seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions. <br>Families are organized in <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> with <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> regulating the contact family members have with one another.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure
Seeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family." Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. "Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them." Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.
Maps the family's underlying structure.
Intervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating
Enactment
Structural Mapping
Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
Boundary Making
Unbalancing
Challenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong
Pushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Family is depicted as a system that comprised of <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a>. A family is functional to the degree that it nurtures its members to negotiate well the demands of the outside world. <br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> set limits distinguishing subsystems from one another in varying permeability (from diffuse to rigid).
Subsystems separated by a diffuse boundary are enmeshed, whereas subsystems separated by a rigid boundary are disengaged. Major Concepts: Family

A set of rules governing behavior patterns
Structures typically have some form of hierarchical structure. Reciprocal and complementary functions. Parental involvement with children, over versus under involvement. Structure is expressed through transactional patterns such as: <br><a data-href="Hierarchy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchy</a> Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system.

Patterns of interaction are largely based on roles and rules. Covert coalitions are often more significant than obvious groupings.

Children are common 'symptom bearers.'

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.
The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.
The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. Theoretical Formulations: Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. But rather by a functioning structure Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. Problems arise when there are: Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions
Inflexible structures
Failure to adjust to changing circumstances Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment. The ultimate goal of therapy is structural changes to the family Alter the family structure so that the family can solve its own problems. General goal: create or strengthen executive subsystem Therapists have two types of assessment tools: <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> Spontaneous behavior sequences
Enactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems
Therapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences. Joining and accommodating (effective therapy requires challenge and confrontation) "The structural therapist needs to relate to family members in a way that validates their experience but does not preclude a challenge to the status quo." Working with interaction (Use of enactments)
Mapping structural patterns (Observing enmeshment and disengagement) Focus on the underlying family structure: Highlight and modify interactions
Intensity (interrupt rigid and difficult patters)
"Challenging to be effective must be predicated on the client's strengths. Contrary to a common misconception, it is not the 'opposite' of joining. Joining and challenging need to be seen as simultaneous qualities in any therapeutic intervention."

Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Structural Family Therapy/Key Terms and Concepts/Structure.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shaping]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Believed in using the resources of his clients and designing a 'strategy for each specific problem.'
He did not care about perspective (insight) as long as their actions produced beneficial results. Conducted therapy by paying extreme attention to details of symptoms his clients presented. IN therapy: Accepted and emphasized positive
Used indirect and ambiguously worded directives.
Directed routine behaviors so that the resistance is shown through change and not through normal and continuous actions. The MRI Model, Milan Model, and Haley and Madanes all overlap.

Generating change rather than generating insight. Circumventing resistance rather than dealing directly with it. People are always communicating.
All behavior is communicative
One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. Report = CONTENT = Information = WHAT IS SAID
Command = PROCESS = Underlying Relationship = HOW IT IS SAID Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life. BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as, how they view the problem, themselves, and each other. Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients being to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (positive feedback loops) that maintain an impasse. The rules or regularities of family interaction that operate to preserve family stability. The conservation aspect of family systems (similar to cybernetic concept of negative feedback). When a specific behavior within a system changes. When the rules of a system change. Rules are typically unspoken, and govern most behavior. When rules promote rigid attempted solutions, it isn't just the behavior, but the rule needs to change. <br>When a specific behavior within a system changes = <a data-href="First-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">First-Order Change</a>
<br>When the rules of the system change = <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> Families are stuck in a spiraling positive feedback loop. They make common sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums. The job is simply to get the family moving again. Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. MRI: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. Haley: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around). Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. MRI Group: Carefully defining the presenting problem and figuring out why it is perpetuated. Non-historic and symptom focused. Haley and Madanes: Examine behavioral sequences around the problem. Examine structural anomalies (weak parental hierarchies, cross-generational coalitions) Milan Group: Preliminary hypothesis tested using circular questioning (systemic explanations). Find the most motivated person in the system. Gain clear understanding of problem (symptom).
"What will be the first signs that things are getting better?"
Inquire about attempted solutions. Observe and interrupt problem-maintaining sequences. Use therapeutic paradox. Family encourages depressed member to be sad so he feels less guilt for not being happy. The solution is to deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it should not be. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. Haley joins and interviews the entire family. Social Stage -&gt; Problem Stage -&gt; Interaction Stage -&gt; Goal-Setting Stage -&gt; Task-Oriented Stage Each family member should speak and introduce themselves. Therapist should ensure problems are not discussed until everyone can speak. Therapist should examine family seating arrangements to assess organization. Keep conclusions tentative. Shift to the therapy stage. Inquire why the family is there and what the problem is. Be general and ambiguous so the family can expand. Respect the family hierarchy to gain cooperation. Treat those who have power and influence in the family with respect. Therapist should not share observations with the family. Therapist should think of the problems in terms of more than one person. It is critical family members interact with one another rather than with the therapist. Therapist should redirect family members toward each other. Assess family organization through interactions. Families need to define desired changes. Therapist can act as wise advisor and assist the family in setting goals. Use of directives (interventions aimed at targeting and changing specific behaviors). Pre-Session, Session, Intersession, Intervention, Post-Session Discussion
Positive connotation (reframing without blaming)
Circular questioning
Team approach (Reflecting team, greek chorus)
Neutrality Responsible for guidance of treatment. We are going to focus on what the problem is. Be aware of timing and pacing. Meet client where they are. Take the time (to form treatment plans) Respond to subtle pressure from clients. Avoid attempting interventions prematurely. Gather enough data about where the client is at before making attempts at intervention. Use of Qualifying Language: "I have a suggestion to make, but I am not sure how much it will accomplish. It will depend on your ability to use your imagination..." Getting client to be specific. Taking one-downmanship. The inherent power difference in therapy Determining the format of meeting. Individual vs. Conjoint
In what situation will individual session be beneficial? 'Window Shopper' Client: Re-negotiate contract
Working with the complainant
Get them down to business Restrictive Client: Ask permission to redirect
Setting specific boundary Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist to understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Never tell client why we do this. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about.
Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed they are instructed to make a list of all of the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. "The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation." (Piercy et al., 1996)
Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: "Who makes you depressed?"
"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/strategic-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Strategic Family Therapy/Strategic Family Therapy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Second-Order Change]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. Other Stop reading for a few minutes and think about some families you know that would fit the description ‚Äútroubled.‚Äù Did the family you grew up in have some of these characteristics: Was your family at times cold, deadening, super polite, secretive, confusing? What are the characteristics of the family you are living in now? Can you discover any signs of trouble that you haven‚Äôt been aware of before?
Can you think of a family that you would call nurturing at least part of the time? Can you remember a time recently when your family could be described as nurturing? Try to remember how it felt to be in your family then. Do these times happen often?
Invite your family members to try the following experiment with you. Take a partner, then tell one another your feelings ("Right now, I feel scared/tight/embarrassed/happy/etc."). Each partner simply thanks the other without judging or commenting. You thus hear one another's feelings so you can know each other better. We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. Practice as much as you can with people you trust. Now, tell each other what makes you each feel low, or high. You may find new dimensions to the people you have been living with all these years and feel closer or more real to them as a result. When you have finished the exercise, give yourself permission to share what happened for you.
Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication). Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued? Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Take a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon. The topic is ‚ÄúWhat new has been happening to me lately?‚Äù Everyone has a chance to share, not just the children. Leadership can rotate among the members. Don‚Äôt forget the celebration party afterward. You will probably find these times can be very enjoyable. You might try creating a funny or romantic theme, for instance. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/self-of-the-therapist-reflections.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Self of the Therapist Reflections.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Each part is interconnected. The less these 8 areas are given energy and time, the lower a person's self-esteem. <br>When people experience low self-esteem, they attempt to cope by using <a data-href="Survival Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Survival Stances</a>.

Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. <br>The goal of Satir's therapy is to help people enhance their own and others' self-esteem. When we do so, we function from a <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication stance. This is the healthiest position we can operate from. The Satir Growth Model is a strength-based approach, focusing on the existing resources that family members bring with them. Faulty coping strategies maintain problematic interactions. Therapy provides a safe space for people to choose alternative ways of coping. Therapy increases people's self-esteem, leading them to be able to lean into their uniqueness and provide a space for their loved ones to feel comfortable in their own uniqueness as well. Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic. (Congruence) Self-Esteem Maintenance Kit: Detective Hat: Used when there is something new that the person wants to understand better. It helped them shift away from judging an experience to exploring it. Medallion: Two-sided and says 'yes' on one side and 'no' on the other. It is intended to help the person recognize that they can say either word, depending on what they truly want, so they can maintain their integrity. Wand (Empowering wand, courage stick, wishing wand): Helps people move from inaction based on fear to action based on desire. Golden Key: Opens any door - helping the person ask questions they might not have previously, so the unsayable, and do the undoable. Wisdom Box: Helps connect the person to the wider world and all that has come before them. <br>Experiential therapists are interactive in the therapy room. They try to use their whole self for contact. This includes adopting an <a data-href="I-Thou Perspective" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">I-Thou Perspective</a>, where they try to promote human-to-human interaction. Since one of the main goals of therapy is to help the client become more congruent, it is important for the therapist to engage the client congruently. The therapist must be a real person who helps model a way of being for the client. Experiential therapists conceptualize a few main processes: Status Quo: The family is currently in this process, and is leading to difficulties bringing them to therapy. Foreign Element: The family's expression of the desire to change. Chaos: The therapist's introduction of novelty into the system. Integration: Family members put what they learn from therapy into practice. Practice: Involves trying out these learnings. New Status Quo:
- New homeostasis takes hold.<br>

Therapy then helps people to allow others to be more authentic. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Sculpting helps people get in touch with their inner experience and express this experience to others in a way that bypasses the typical spoken word. Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways: The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another. <br><a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a>: Designed to help an individual connect better to the historical and psychological interconnections of their family.

The therapist ('guide') begins the family reconstruction by telling the star's story; then sculpts the family of origin, the star's parents' families of origin, and the star's parents' relationship; and then resculpts the star's family of origin. The overall goal is to increase the star's self-esteem so they are empowered to engage with themselves and others in new and more productive ways. This should engender more hope in them for their future. <br><a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>: Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes. "The Growth Model," where the focus was on helping people access their inner resources as opposed to, "The Medical Model," where the emphasis was on pathology and symptom reduction. <br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. "The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341) Her goals for family therapy included helping the individual members increase their sense of worth and value by accessing their inner resources and by decreasing any emotional blocks. And for the family as a whole, she saw the goal as being to increase congruent communication and heart connections. She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.
It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
It is not okay to ask for what you want.
It is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: "What do you see going on between your and your ?"
"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family." <br>She also helped them to make better connections with each other by decreasing their defensiveness. Satir identified the primary defensive stances as <a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a>, <a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>, <a data-href="Distracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distracting</a>, and being <a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>.

Physically Withdrawing (Leaving the room or hanging up on someone.)
Cutting-Off (Refusing to talk to the other for days or longer.) Within a family system, these defenses can be played out in interactional patterns such as: Blame - Blame
Blame - Withdraw
Placate - Placate
Blame - Placate
Blame - Distract
Withdraw - Withdraw Satir developed a process for helping people change and become more connected. Her process is described as having six phases: Phase 1 - Making Contact Satir would reach out using her body position, eye contact, and facial expression to make contact with each member. She would also consciously work to connect from her spirit to theirs. Phase 2 - Validating Satir worked to help people feel validated in many ways such as reflecting their feelings, affirming their values and highlighting their inner resources. Examples include: "You feel scared because your son got suspended from school."
"You value education."
"You are courageous to seek help." Phase 3 - Facilitating Awareness Satir had many different ways that she would attempt to bring awareness to a family about their defensive patterns in a non-blaming way. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Satir placed the members in body positions to give them a picture of their defensive behavior. For the blaming stance, she would position the person leaning toward another and pointing at them and for the placating stance, she would position the person down on one knee with their head down and their hand up in a pleading position. Satir would also bring awareness to members by exploring their inner experiences. She used the metaphor of an iceberg to help the family therapist to conceptualize the inner level so experience driving defensive behaviors. Above the water line were the inner levels of experience such as feelings, perceptions, expectations, beliefs, and yearnings. (What meaning are you giving to what your ___ said that is causing you to feel hurt? Is that a familiar place for you to go to when someone is disappointed in you? What is it you yearn for?) Phase 4 - Promoting Acceptance One of the ways that satir promoted acceptance was through 'normalizing,' that is, reassuring the family member that what they were experiencing was normal. ("It is normal to...")
Another way that she promoted acceptance was by 'bridging' between conflicting parties. ("I am hearing that is is not easy for _, I would be interested to know how life was for you when you were their age?") Phase 5 - Eliciting Positive Choices and Changes Once Satir observed that the family members were aware of and accepting of their unhelpful patterns, she would lead them into seeing new possibilities for their interactions. After sculpting the family, she would ask them to each to stand in a balanced way and look at each other. She would then guide them in a dialogue helping them to express themselves in non-defensives ways. Other times she would simply have them sit face to face and she would guide the dialogue between them. "What happens for you when your says you choose over your ? You feel... Did you know that your felt __? What happened for you when you heard them express their feelings? You long to be more connected with them. You miss them. How do you feel to hear how much they miss you?" Phase 6 - Reinforcing Change Satir would often combine verbal responses with some supportive touch to reinforce a positive shift. The therapist also needs to work on their own personal growth. This is true for working with individuals but it is even more true when working with families as the chances of being triggered by your own family experience are even greater. As Satir used to say, "You are the most important instrument in the room!" Under threat and reward, change is painful: change is viewed as unnatural, the unknown is feared, the status quo is maintained, life's natural 'flow' is blocked, and the familiar is valued despite discomfort. The seed model has people viewing change more positively; as naturally occurring at a variety of levels (from cellular to cosmic) and as scary, but offering new opportunities. Discomfort is seen as a signal for change. Therapists using the seed model keep in mind that families entering therapy are problem-focused and will maintain the status quo as a necessary survival behavior. Therapist should make contact with each person to communicate a climate of acceptance (e.g., people do the best they can) and hear them out to discover 'what is.'
Understanding the status quo stage is essential to clarify how the change process gets started or is blocked. This stage is explored further by examining resistance and readiness concepts in detail. The coin of change has resistance and readiness as its head and tail sides. Experientially, we may want to change in one moment and fear or sabotage it in the next. Then status quo is considered a trance, accounting for change resistance as well as a medium in which change may be fostered. Changing circumstances elicit shifts in perception, which in turn stimulate changes in thinking, feeling, and acting. But when circumstances shift back, behavior also reverts. Perception can appear to create change of behavior when the meaning of an event is reframed, but the underlying pattern is not altered. Altering the underlying pattern requires dealing with resistance to change. Resistance is a coping behavior intended to preserve the organism rather than obstruct change. Reframing resistance in terms of its positive intention. The way we are socialized has us, "Gradually acquiring a variety of commitments which constrain the person into following a consistent pattern of behavior." The effect is to develop a lifestyle that stabilizes the events in our lives, our interdependence of meaning of these events, and the way we define ourselves, as well as predisposing us to seek consistent situations. Experientially, change involves invoking the unfamiliar. Intellectualizing, avoiding feelings, compulsive activity, impatience about change, and dwelling in the past are all ways of dealing with the confusion by maintaining the status quo. The tasks at this stage are to cope with the threat to past security and sense of competence and self-esteem; deal with feelings of loss and longing for the past.
Conservative impulse, the will to change has to overcome an impulse to restore the past, to resist the change. Survival depends on this impulse. By stabilizing perceptions, the conservative impulse enhances the ability to learn from experience. Only when it does not fit this construct is its 'newness' experienced. <br><a data-href="Readiness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/readiness.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Readiness</a> refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>. Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain. Four patterns emerge reflecting the relative influence of these readiness factors. These patters are based on the degree of difficulty involved in making the change and the degree of responsibility the person is wiling to take for making the change. <br><a data-href="Preemptive Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preemptive Change</a>: This pattern describes 'overnight' change. The inordinate strength of the motivating influences lowers the degree of difficulty in making the change. The degree of responsibility for the change is also low. The change in circumstances preempts issues of loss (leaving family and friends), self-efficacy ("Can I do it?"), and self-esteem ("Am I worth the effort?") that are ordinarily addressed in making changes. Problems maintaining the change may require attention at a later point in the change process. Change literally 'happens' to us in this pattern, but we have little sense of ownership of it. <br><a data-href="Self-Managed Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Managed Change</a>: In this pattern, the influences motivating the change are less extreme or immediate than those noted in the preemptive patter. The person is influenced to take a conscious and self-responsible approach to change and is required to deal with one or more of the issues of loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in order to resolve the resistance to change. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" target="_self">Satir Family Therapy - YouTube</a> Experiential family therapies include four approaches: <br><a data-href="Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)</a>

No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Must increase ability to recognize thoughts and feelings of self and others.
The focus for the therapist is on creating safety. Help them learn to recognize, and not be afraid of their thoughts and the thoughts of others. Stances acknowledge or minimize three realities: Self
Other
Context When we feel unsafe, we revert back to one of these communication stances. These are the stances used when someone is frightened. When we don't feel safe as children, we evolve communication stances to survive when we do not feel safe when we are young. You can use the communication stances to help better understand how to intervene, or how to communicate with your client. When you are working with a placator, be cautious if you are going to be making a suggestion it may help to give options. "Which do you think is the best fit or might work for you?" Ask them to give voice to their thoughts and opinions because they will be very quick even to please the therapist. Their task us to learn to assert themselves in a healthy way, how can they assert their needs so that they don't become resentful, depressed (needs do not get taken care of because they are not advocating for themselves) Therapy involves going through stages several times. Can be a new way of looking at the interactions and how to communicate in a more congruent way.

Emotional Role of Symptom Symptom has a role in the family system Example: Child's exaggerated acting out may serve to reduce tension in marriage by getting parents on the same page. If the therapist can understand how symptom makes emotional sense, it will be easier to help find ways to interact successfully. Problematic family dynamics typically involve: Power struggles
Parental conflicts
Lack of validation
Lack of intimacy Each person's role in family is assessed to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles: Martyr
Victim or helpless one
Rescuer
Good child/parent
Bad child/parent Timeline that includes major events in individual's or family's life. Births and deaths
Important family events: Marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss Important historical events: Wars, natural disasters, economic downturns Gives both the therapist and client insight into the context of the problem as well as strengths and resources might exist. Child, mother, and father and quality of relationship between them. In this primary triad a child learns how to be human. The triad should serve as nurturing system for child. When the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. Layers of the iceberg: Behavior (Top Layer)
Coping (Above)
Feelings (Below) that are related to coping
Perceptions, how is the person perceiving their life or how do they make meaning?
Expectations, what are the expectations that are fueling all of this
Yearnings (what are the primal yearnings) Helps clients transform their feelings about feelings to make change. Helps clients observe and evaluate themselves. Considers aspects of the self that the client values and aspects of which they are ashamed
Self-Compassion: Better indicator of happiness than self-esteem As self-compassion and self-worth rise, Become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses.

Ingredients of an interaction Whenever the therapist is talking with clients about difficult situations and interactions with others, they ask a series of questions. Go back to the iceberg. What do I hear and see? What is happening at the behavioral level without any interpretation. What are the meanings I make of this? What are they saying? What feelings do I have about these meanings I am making? What feelings do I have about those feelings? What defenses do I use/am I using? How does this trigger me and what kind of defensive behaviors might I bring, that makes them ‚Ä¶. ?
What are the rules within the system about how to comment about what's going on? What is allowed and what is appropriate? How am I responding and what part do I play in the system? Facilitating emotional expression What is allowed and what is appropriate? What is my response and what am I doing in this situation?
Congruent expression, without the communication stances, turn chairs to each other directly, hold hands, make eye contact Softening family rules When families have rigid rules about who can say what, when, where, and how, she will soften some of these to create more space for everyone's particular way of communicating in a comfortable way to hopefully reduce the use of communication stances. Communication enhancement Helping each member of the family learn to communicate congruently in stressful circumstances, even when they do feel threatened by their partner or their child, Rather than reverting to a survival stance, to help them learn how to be fully congruent and present and to have more effective communications. Sculpting or spatial metaphor She would position each person in the family to metaphorically represent their role. (Example: A placator may be sculpted as being on their knees and begging, the blamer may be there pointing their finger angrily at someone, the irrelevant type might be in a strange position far off from everybody else, the super-reasonable might be sitting there in a very cold, distant, "I am citing the rulebook")
Because it is more visual than verbal - you can add a verbal element to it by having each person say a motto of theirs (eg., "Please be nice to me," "Do what I say," "Follow the rules,") - that represents their position in the family. It can push past the survival stances, intellectual defenses, the family could sculpt themselves.
It can be a powerful intervention. Touch Touch clients, help clients learn to hold and touch each other in nurturing ways, The therapist must be aware of cultures that have different attitudes towards emotional expression. The therapist adjusts to the client's level of intimacy. Used commonly in the LGBTQ community Focus is on the burden of societal rejection when being the authentic self.

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href="Paul Watzlawick" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href="Richard Fisch" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. <br><a data-href="Integration of New Possibilities" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Integration of New Possibilities</a> Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?
Is each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness
<br>Accurate <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>
Unconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit
Open body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact
Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href="Role of the Symptom" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/role-of-the-symptom.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role of the Symptom</a> in the System <br>Describe how the symptom maintains the family's homeostasis at an emotional level, often regulating closeness and distance (<a data-href="Distance Regulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distance Regulation</a>; <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>) Family Dynamics Identify salient dynamics Power struggles

Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life.

Discounts self, other, and context. Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. Avoidance No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Associated with most severe pathology Therapeutic Implications: Creates significant challenge for therapist
Identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality
Make the therapeutic relationship a place of upmost safety; less need for distracting communication
Increase client's ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others
Acknowledge the demands of context A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Key Terms and Concepts/Irrelevant (Distractor).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family Life Chronology]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive. Privileges self and context while discounting the other. To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.
Their experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. Assert their needs and desires while minimizing those of others. You will find placator and blamer married in therapy because their stances are complimentary.

Direct confrontation often strengthens therapeutic relationship (they will find placators as weak) Acknowledge Self/Context Minimize other
Best connect with those who blame by addressing their expectations Therapeutic Implications: Generally prefer more upfront and direct communication
Increase blamers' awareness of others' feelings
Learn how to communicate in ways that are respectful of others
Direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Key Terms and Concepts/Blaming (Blamer).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contextual Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Was limited in its approach to families because it often did not consider the complicated nature of family systems. Based on learning theories; was aimed at parent training and couple communication. The approach is now making changes to be more adaptive to the: Complex systems imbedded in families Classical Conditioning: Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS) Food Unconditioned Response (UCR) Salivation Conditioned Stimulus (CS) Ringing Bell Systematic Desensitization De-conditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition. Operant Conditioning: Responses that are positively reinforced will be repeated more frequently
Behaviors that are punished or ignored will be reduced or extinguished <br><img alt="Positive and Negative Reinforcement.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/positive-and-negative-reinforcement.png" target="_self"> Developed behavioral parent training Behavioral approaches to couple and family therapy Introduced cognitive elements into behavioral therapy. Cognitive triangle: Thoughts -&gt; feelings -&gt; behaviors -&gt; thoughts Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
Behavior problems are caused by: Dysfunctional patterns of reinforcement between parents and children. Behavior will remain resistant to change until more rewarding consequences are introduced.
<br><a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>: People strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. Cognitive theorists emphasized the need for attitude changes to: Promote and maintain behavior change. Behavioral approaches are typically limited to two party relationships: Parent/child, spouses.
Fail to take into account the triadic nature of relationships. Cognitive techniques became more prominent as behavior therapists realized: An exclusive focus on behavior often failed to address the complicated dynamics of couple and family interaction. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Healthy families are those in which positive behaviors are maintained by: Appropriate consequences
Negative behaviors are extinguished through the use of punishment Healthy families have high rations of benefits to costs
(Philippines, there is no such thing as divorce)
Healthy couples will be able to engage in:
Effective communication skills, problem-solving skills, and conflict resolution.
Healthy families and couples could adapt, be flexible, and change. Behavioral Family Therapy: Symptoms are viewed as learned responses.
For behavioral therapists, no underlying meanings of symptoms are sought. Attention is focused on the symptoms themselves and the environmental responses that reinforce behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapists will include ideas about dysfunctional schemas: Regarding family roles and relationships that are learned in one's family-of-origin,
Cognitive Distortions: Arbitrary Inference: Conclusions are drawn in the absence of supporting evidence. Selective Abstraction: Certain details are highlighted while other important information is ignored. Overgeneralization: Isolated incidents are taken as general patterns. Magnification and Minimization: The significance of events is unrealistically magnified or diminished. Personalization: Events are arbitrarily interpreted in reference to oneself. Dichotomous Thinking: Experiences are interpreted as all good or all bad. Labeling and Mislabeling: Behavior is attributed to undesirable personality traits. Mind Reading: This is the magical gift of knowing what other people are thinking about without the aid of verbal communication. Behavior and cognitive changes in the way one behaves toward/thinks about family.
Increase the rate of rewarding interactions in family relationships.
Decrease the use of negative family interactions; increase positive interaction.
Teach effective communication and problem-solving skills.
Alter negative thought patterns; promoted or maintain ineffective family interactions. Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered.
Identify behavioral goals.
Learn techniques to achieve these goals.
Facilitate social reinforcement of change. A hallmark of behavioral therapy.
Families and couples - questionnaires and home observations are conducted. For sex therapy, clinical interviews are the main assessment tool. Treatment goals are set based on results of assessment.
2-4 sessions (About 1.5-2 hours each) Main Point: To gather information as much as possible at the beginning to form treatment plan.
Each person takes turn to respond. Gather information, perspective-taking and avoid escalation. Information Gathering: Self-report questionnaires, clinical interviews, observation of interactional patterns. Initial Conjoint Interviews (Couple): CBCT: How the couple met, what attracted them to each other, how they developed a deeper involvement, positive and negative life events, prior experiences in therapy. Initial Conjoint Interviews (Families): Inquired about the family members' current concerns and strengths of the relationship.
Orients the family to the process of therapy by describing the structure and course of CBFT and the roles of therapist and family. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment, and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals.
Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy.
Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words. Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of. The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback The agenda of therapy is educational. Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation. Didactic role early on to strike a balance between directiveness and collaboration.
Reviews homework assignments, models skills, coaches family members in practicing them, and fosters motivation.
Balances alliances and interventions with all the family members or subsystems, so that they feel supported and remain equally invested in improving relationships. Directive Role of the Therapist: Sets the pace of sessions so that the goals of treatment are addressed in a timely and sequential fashion. Sets the agenda each session.
Monitors the use of time.
Responsible to stay on task and address the goals of session.
Teaches the clients to self-monitor as well. Maintains control of the session with confidence and credibility.
Assumes multiple roles: Director, educator, facilitator, collaborator, advocate Balances the alliance and interventions with all members, so they feel supported and invested. Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions.
Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interaction patterns with new ones, families need to rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints.
Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement.
Couples are helped to improve their communication.
Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making.
Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Imagery
Roleplay
Coaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)
Communication training: For example, engaging in an argument without attacking, 'I-statements', and Speaker/Listener exercises Problem-solving training
Homework Assignments
Mindfulness and Meditation Parents have control over the rewards and punishment of children. If parents change the contingencies of reinforcement, the child's behavior will change. Skills are taught in sequence (shaping).
Help parents define the child's positive and problematic behaviors in specific observable actions.
Tracking target behaviors.
Reinforcing desired behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts.
Disciplinary techniques include time out, ignoring problem behavior. Observe/Assess the frequency of problem behavior, what precedes it, and what reinforcement follows (Behavior Chaining)
Shaping (reinforcing small steps toward change)
Token economies (reward good behavior)
Contingency contracting (agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their child)
Time out

Skinner" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/b.-f.-skinner.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">B. F. Skinner</a>. In 1948, Wolpe introduced systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization deconditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition by pairing responses incompatible with anxiety to previously anxiety-arousing stimuli. <br>Skinner's <a data-href="Operant Conditioning" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/operant-conditioning.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Operant Conditioning</a>: Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.
The operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Skills taught in sequence. Teach parents to reinforce prosocial behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts. This process also promotes positive relationships between parents and children. Children earn rewards while they learn prosocial skills, and in the process, their self-esteem grows with their success and their parents' positive attention. <br><a data-href="Gerald Patterson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/gerald-patterson.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gerald Patterson</a>: Took the lead in introducing disciplinary techniques, such as time-out, because he discovered that ignoring the problem behavior is not always sufficient, especially with aggressive children. During the 1970s, behavioral and emotional responses, along with the interpersonal transactions that occur within their family, social, vocational, political, and culture networks. <br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a>: Refers to those approaches inspired by the work of Albert Ellis (1962) and Aaron Beck (1976) that emphasize the need for attitude change to promote behavior modification. According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania. The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. <br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy. Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. <br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href="Schemas" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone. Hidden assumptions have a potent impact on how people perceive and react to each other. <br><a data-href="Behavior Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/behavior-exchange-theory.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavior Exchange Theory</a>: A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control. A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills. Neil Jacobson (1981): Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. Attention is a powerful social reinforcer. The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)
Even when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.
Others persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. <br>The use of <a data-href="Aversion Control" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills. Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease') Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. <br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up. These schemas are the basis of biased assumptions that poison relationships by distorting family members' responses to each other. The following are typical <a data-href="Cognitive Distortions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-distortions.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive Distortions</a> cognitive distortions: <br><a data-href="Arbitrary Inference" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/arbitrary-inference.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arbitrary Inference</a>: Conclusions are draw in the absence of supporting evidence.

Example: A husband doesn't know asks his wife what she wants because he 'knows what's going on in her mind' Cognitive restructuring is useful to the extent that it leads to changed behavior, which can be reinforced. The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Consists of reinforcing change in small steps. <br><a data-href="Token Economy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/token-economy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Token Economy</a>: Use points to reward children for good behavior. <br><a data-href="Contingency Contracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-contracting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Contracting</a>: Agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their children. <br><a data-href="Contingency Management" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-management.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Management</a>: Giving and taking away rewards based on children's behavior. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a>: Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior. S for stimulus
O for the state of the organism
R for the target response
KC for the contingency of consequences Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. <br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href="Premack Principle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premack Principle</a> is applied. High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting. Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.
Case Study: Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind. The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession. The most widely used in the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale, a 23-item questionnaire covering various aspects of marital satisfaction, including communication, sex, affection, social activities, and values. Assessments are designed to reveal strengths and weaknesses of a couple's relationship and the manner in which rewards and punishments are exchanged. Interviews and questionnaires are used to specify and elaborate target behaviors. Jacobson's (1981) Pretreatment Assessment for Marital Therapy: Strengths and skills of the relationship: What are the major strengths of this relationship?
What behaviors on the part of each spouse are highly valued by the other?
What shared activities does the couple currently engage in? Presenting Problems: What are the major complaints, and how do these complaints translate into explicit behavioral terms?
What are the reinforcers maintaining these behaviors?
What behaviors occur at less than the desired frequency or fail to occur at appropriate times from the standpoint of each spouse?
What are the consequences of these behaviors currently, when they occur? Sex and Affection: Is either spouse currently dissatisfied with rate, quality, or diversity of sex life together?
If sex is currently a problem, was there a time when it was mutually satisfying?
What are the sexual behaviors that seem to be associated with current dissatisfaction?
Are either or both partners dissatisfied with the amount or quality of nonsexual physical affection? Future Prospects: Are the partners seeking therapy to improve their relationship, to separate, or to decide whether the relationship is worth working on?
What are each spouse's reasons for continuing the relationship despite the current problems? Assessment of Social Environment: What are each person's alternatives to the present relationship?
How attractive are these alternatives to each person?
Is the environment (parents, relatives, friends, work associates, children) supportive of either continuance or dissolution of present relationship? Individual Functioning of Each Spouse: Does either spouse exhibit emotional or behavioral problems?
Have they been in therapy before, either alone or together? What kind of therapy? Outcome?
What is each spouse's past experience with intimate relationships?
How is the present relationship difference? Richard Stuart (1975) lists five strategies that summarize the behavioral approach to troubled marriages: Couples are taught to express themselves in a clear, behavior descriptions rather than in vague complaints.
Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations. Treatment that emphasizes attitude change as well as reinforcement of behavior. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Cognitive-Behavioral Family Therapy (CBT)/Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Triangulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[ Detouring conflict between two people by involving a third person, stabilizing the relationship between the original pair.

The concept of multigenerational transmission process describes how small differences in the levels of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> between parents and their offspring lead over many generations to marked differences in differentiation among the members of an extended family. The information creating these differences is transmitted across generations through relationships. The transmission occurs in several interconnected levels, ranging from the conscious teaching and learning of information to the automatic and unconscious programming of emotional reactions and behaviors. Relationally and genetically transmitted information interact to shape an individual's 'self.' The combination of parents actively shaping the development of their offspring, offspring inately responding to their parents' moods, attitudes, and actions, and the long dependency period of human offspring results in people's developing levels of differentiation of self similar to their parents'. However, the relationship patterns of nuclear family emotional systems often result in at least one member of a sibling group developing a little more 'self' and another member developing a little less 'self' than the parents. People predictably select mates with levels of differentiation of self that match their own. Therefore, if one offspring's level of 'self' is higher than the parents' and another is lower, one offspring's marriage is more differentiated and the other's marriage is less differentiated than the parents' marriage. If each offspring then has a child who is more differentiated and a child who is less differentiated than himself, one three generational line becomes progressively more differentiated (the most differentiated child of the most differentiated offspring) and one line becomes progressively less differentiated (the least differentiated child of the least differentiated offspring). As these processes repeat over multiple generations, the differences between family lines grow increasingly marked. Levels of differntiation of self can affect longevity, marital stability, reproduction, health, educational accomplishments, and occupational successes. This impact of differentiation on overall life functioning explains the marked variation that typically exists in the lives of the members of a multigenerational family. The highly differentiated people have unusually stable nuclear families and contribute much to society. The poorly differentiated people have chaotic personal lives and depend heavily on others to sustain them. A key implication of the multigenerational concept is that the roots of the most severe human problems, as well as of the highest levels of human adaptation, are generations deep. The multigenerational transmission process not only programs the levels of 'self' people develop but also how people interact with others. Both types of programming affect the selection of a spouse For example, if a family programs someone to atta ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/multigenerational-transmission-process.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/Key Terms and Concepts/Multigenerational Transmission Process.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fusion]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Questionnaires The mental status examination is a structured assessment of the patient's behavioral and cognitive functioning. In general, the components of a mental status exam include descriptions of the following: Appearance: Casual dress, normal grooming and hygiene. Attitude: Calm and cooperative General Behavior: Unusual movements or psychomotor changes Speech and Language: Normal rate/tone/volume and without pressure Emotions: Reactive and mood congruent, labile, tearful, blunted, normal range, depressed, constricted, flat Mood: Euthymic, irritable, elevated, anxious, depressed Thought and Perception: Goal-directed and logical or disorganized
Suicidal ideation: passive, active, plan?
Homicidal ideation: passive, active plan?
Hallucinations or delusions during interview Cognition
Orientation: oriented to time, place, person, self Biopsychosocial Model: ‚ÄúScreenshot 2023-09-27 at 10.25.48 AM.png‚Äù could not be found.
A Biopsychosocial Assessment is an assessment typically conducted by therapists at the beginning of therapy, which assesses for biological, psychological, and social factors that can be contributing to a problem or problems with a client. Biopsychosocial Assessments enable therapist to diagnose and effectively treat clients. Tasks and Process of Assessment: Make Initial Contact
Develop a collaborative therapeutic relationship
Use a bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual assessment: Person-in-Environment
Defining problems
Assessing safety
Accessing and appreciating patient/clients' strengths
Assess systems collaboration issues and strengths
Expand awareness and perspectives
Assess goals Biopsychosocial Assessment Areas: Demographic Information (Age, Ethnicity, Religion, Relational Status, Referral Status, etc.)
History of the Presenting Problem
Psychiatric History
Trauma History
Family Psychiatric History
Medical History
Medication Use
Substance Use
Family History (Family of Origin, Relationship with Parents, Siblings, etc.)
Social History
Spiritual/Cultural Factors
Developmental History
Educational/Vocational History
Legal History
SNAP (Strength, Needs, Abilities, Preferences)
Other Important Information Guiding Principles for Assessment: A systemic view: Everything is connected Foundational importance of bio-physiological, psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual domains in relation to multiple service systems
A strengths-based perspective
Assessment as an ongoing process Regular screening and tracking during sessions of the following: Health status
Mobility
Wellness Exercise
Nutrition
Sleep Ensure that client has primary care physician
Communicate with primate care physician or other health providers as needed. General Psychological Issues: Cognitive skills and ability (e.g.. thought process, problem-solving/decision-making skills)
Behavioral skills
Emotional competencies: Affect regulation
Capacity for relating Motivational factors Overall mental status
Risk Assessment
Specific Mental Health Concerns: Depression
Anxiety
Substance Use Appropriate referral if needed
Ongoing communication between external providers (collaboration of care) Risk Assessment includes consideration of psychological and social factors as part of a comprehensive review to capture client needs, and to assess their risk of harm to themselves or others. Assessments often aim to categorize patients as at high, medium, or low risk
Examples of risk areas include: Suicidal ideation
Homicidal ideation
Child abuse/neglect
Intimate partner violence
Physical health issues or crises Inability to care for self or others Animal abuse
Substance abuse Important factors: Level of risk
Intent to act
Plan to act
Means to act
Risk and protective factors Assessing Strengths: Personal and Relational Strengths: Bio-physiological
Psychological
Sociocultural
Spiritual 'Strengths' of the problem/symptoms
Strengths in systems collaboration Exploring the 'Strengths' and Potential 'Contributions' of the Problem When was the last time that you realized that the problem was helpful to you?
If your problem has a voice, what do you think it is trying to share or communicate with you?
How might the problem be helpful to you?
If we could get rid of the problem, what might be some aspect of it that you might want to retain? Useful Questions for Assessing Strengths: What has been helpful so far?
What are some of your successes?
What are the achievements that you are most proud of having accomplished?
What little things are you doing that make life a little better for you?
What kinds of things do people compliment you on?
When have you stopped doing something that was difficult for you to stop?
When have you made an important change in your life that was difficult to make?
When have you broken a habit that was hard to break? Outcomes of Assessment: Problems: Bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual perspective
Problem and attempted solutions specifically and behaviorally described (SOLVABLE). Goals: Desired future outcomes
Specifically and behaviorally described (ATTAINABLE)
Professional and the patient/client mutually agree to the described problems and goals. Treatment plan and interventions based on mutual consensus of problem and goal David A. Jobes, Ph.D. Creator of CAMS Framework Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) It is a therapeutic framework for suicide-specific assessment and treatment of a patient's suicidal risk. It is a flexible approach that can be used across theoretical orientations and disciplines for a wide range of suicidal patients across treatment settings and different treatment modalities. Every session of CAMS intentionally utilizes the patient's input about what is and is not working. All assessment work in CAMS is collaborative. The clinician's honesty and forthrightness are key elements. The CAMS clinician endeavors to understand their patient's suffering from an empathic, nonjudgemental, and intra-subjective perspective. The clinician never shames or blames a suicidal person for being suicidal. Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments for Suicide: Three evidence-based (randomized controlled trials) interventions and treatments that are designed to directly target suicide at risk. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT): Suicide Prevention (CT-SP) and Brief CBT. Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) Suicide-Specific Brief Interventions: Evidence-Based (Random Controlled Trial): Teachable Moment Brief Intervention (TMBI): A one-time intervention 2 dats after an attempt. Motivational Interviewing: In-patient settings Crisis Response Planning &amp; Safety Planning (6 Steps)

The initial emphasis was on observation and research on families, but due to the influence of Milton Erikson's work, intervention strategies were also formulated. Believed in using the resources of his clients and designing a 'strategy for each specific problem'
He did not care about perspective (insight) as long as their actions produced beneficial results. Conducted therapy by paying extreme attention to details of the symptoms his clients presented. In therapy: Accepted and emphasized positive
Used indirect and ambiguously worded directives
Directed routine behaviors so that the resistance is shown through change and not through normal continuous actions.

Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people. Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. People are always communicating. All behavior is communicative. One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions Report = Content = information = (What is said)
Command = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life
BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.
Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions Go slow
Engage in behavior they want to eliminate What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. <br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. <br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop.

Centerpiece of the model
Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it. Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. What often needs to happen? Reverse the solution! <br><a data-href="Paradoxical Injunction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/paradoxical-injunction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paradoxical Injunction</a>: <br>A technique used in <a data-href="Strategic Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/strategic-family-therapy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Strategic Family Therapy</a> whereby the therapist directs family members to continue their symptomatic behavior.

Structural: Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies. Functional: Problems result when people try to protect or control one another covertly, so that their symptoms serve a function for the system. Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. The job is simply to get the family moving again.
Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. In pushing family members to set concrete goals, they are forced to clarify vague dissatisfactions. The primary goal is behavior change. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. <br><a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. <br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around) Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. Define a resolvable complaint. Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. Who sees it as a problem?
Why is it a problem now? "What is the problem that brings you here today?" is too vague. Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. The solution is part of the problem.
Prescribe some alternative behavior!
The key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. MRI Approach: Introduction to the treatment setup
Inquiry and definition of the problem
Estimation of the behavior maintaining the problem
Setting goals for treatment
Selecting and making behavioral interventions
Termination Attempted solutions: The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories: When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT
When clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING
When clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. Paradoxical interventions: The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s). Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. Restraining technique: Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different. Co-founded the Family Therapy Institute of Washington D.C. (1974)

Emphasize short term treatment (10 sessions) Define a problem clearly
Investigating all solutions that have previously been tried
Defining a clear and concrete change to be achieved
Formulating and implementing a strategy for change Therapists must be innovative
Therapy must be customizable to families (technique driven)
If families are going to change, alterations in ways their members act must precede new perceptions or feelings
Focus on interpersonal payoff of psychiatric symptoms Social Stage: Introduction and setup
Help everyone relax, greet each family member, make sure everyone is comfortable. Problem Stage: Definition of the problem in clear behavioral terms
Ask each individual for their perspective, speak to the less involved parent/partner first to get their involvement, listen carefully to the way each family member describes the problem, make sure no one interrupts until each has a turn, make observations. Emphasize the use of directives.
If therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. Interaction Stage: Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem
Encourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another? Goal Setting Stage Providing directives
Give the family a task, directives Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. "The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation." For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: "Who makes you depressed?"
"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. Example: A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent. Mandanes talked about how one relationship may metaphorically replicate another and power struggles in couples (money, education, control of children, etc.) Negotiation (pg. 90)

Pretend techniques (pg. 91)
Ordeals (pg. 91) Hayley believed that telling people what they're doing wrong only mobilizes resistance. Changes in behavior alter perceptions. Milan group was interested in getting families to see things differently through (reframe) positive connotation. Which then gets family members to behave differently. Shift from behavior to cognition set stage for constructivist/narrative movements. Families should have clear generational boundaries. Therapists should be 'neutral' and not have expectations for families. Therapy helps the family by simply examining the family, asking questions to help them examine their own family structure, and exposing games after which they can redesign their family into a better structure on their own. <br><a data-href="Mara Selvini Palazzoli" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/mara-selvini-palazzoli.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mara Selvini Palazzoli</a>

Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. Set minimum goals for change. Investigate solutions to the complaints. Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'
Understand clients' preferred views. Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'
Nurture and solidify initial change. Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)
Therapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)
Co-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)
Late in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?
I don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. Define a resolvable complaint. Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint Who is doing what?
If I had a video of this, what would I see? Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?
Determine a minimum change goal What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem: What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?
What happens after these attempted solutions? Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like: What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution? The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions: How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?
What do they hold near and dear?
When are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?
What is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?
Whose idea was it to come? Why now?
Who is most optimistic that therapy will help? How will you know the situation is improving?
What kinds of change will you settle for?
What will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?
What will each of you settle for? Therapeutic restraint: Telling clients to 'go slow'
Cautioning them about the dangers of improvement
Giving insturctions about how to make the problem worse Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. Identify problem-solution feedback loops: Demand-Refuse
Discuss-Acoid
Criticize-Defend
Accuse-Deny Encourage the family to do less of the same: When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. <br><a data-href="Reframing" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reframing</a>: For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. Acknowledging (Reinforcing): When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. Predicting or Prescribing: Exploring the dangers of movement. Therapeutic restraint / going slow
Prescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting
Jamming / experiment
Reframing
Less of the same
Acknowledge / reinforce Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on: Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing. Applicable to any family that presents with a clear complaint. Particularly relevant for families that seem resistance to change.

Title: DSM-5 and family systems, Editor: Russo, Jessica A.; Coker, J. Kelly; King, Jason H.; Publisher: Springer Publishing Company, LLC,
Location: New York, NY,
Year: 2017 ISBN: 978-0-8261-8399-6 Keywords: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; Family Therapy; In Progress; Mental Disorders; diagnosis; methods Neurodevelopmental disorders can be defined as a series of complex traits that emerge as a result of genetic determinants interacting with various poorly understood environmental components resulting in a diverse clinical presentation. The onset and diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders occurs in childhood. These disorders rarely experience a remission or relapse and are considered to be a stable set of symptoms over time, and thus neurodevelopmental disorders appear throughout the individual's life span. Bipolar disorder affects and is affected by the family system and successful treatment is enhanced when family embers understand the course and treatment of the illness, respond in supportive ways, and stay patient and empathetic within the context of constructive communication and problem-solving. Bipolar Disorder takes a significant toll on personal efficacy and self-worth and is often bewildering to family members as they try to manage the symptoms of the illness and support their affected loved ones in the midst of frustrating and competing interpersonal, social, and logistical factors. The emergence of Bipolar Disorder as manifested by intense periods of mania, often followed by periods of deep depression, disrupts peace, tests relationships, clouds future dreams and aspirations, and often destroys marriage and family relationships. The presence of mania (As manifest in Bipolar I Disorder) or hypomania (As manifested in Bipolar II Disorder), which is a state of intense, energized mood, cognition, and behavior, resulting in an increased capacity for creativity and clarity of thought (Rational and irrational), rapid ideas and racing thoughts, sometimes irritability and impatience with others, reduced need for sleep, distractibility, and objective-focused activity, and/or energy present most of the time during the episode. With mania and hypomania, there is a decreased need for sleep, increased sexual desire, and a need for stimulation, which can involve risk-taking behaviors resulting in painful and/or harmful consequences. The subjective experience of mania is also characterized as paradoxical where there is a lightning-fast epiphany beyond the vision of all others, which produces a feeling of grandiosity and power. Many who experience mania describe feeling frustrated at their limited capacity to experience and carry forward these creative insights, like drinking water from a fire hose. Mania, but not hypomania, is also sometimes accompanied by delusional thinking and psychosis, which mimic symptoms of <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. Hypomania contains similar symptoms manifest in mania, but of a lesser duration and lesser intensity, and is a characteristic of Bipolar II Disorder. The most frightening time for those experiencing mania is when it begins to dissipate because for many it signals the descent into depression. Another complex manifestation of depression is Bipolar With Mixed Episodes. These depressive episodes are characterized by deep sadness, hopelessness, feelings of emptiness, fatigue, lack of energy, loss of appetite, listlessness, dysphoria, and apathy for a minimum of 2 weeks. Depressive episodes are often attended by shame and embarrassment for the consequence of manic actions, a lack of pleasure in activities once enjoyable, the need to isolate from others, a sense of worthlessness, guilt, stomach aches and pains, troubled sleep, and thoughts of death. Whereas in mania, the risk of death is typically from thrill seeking, in depressed individuals, the primary risk of death is suicide. Many who suffer from bipolar depression describe the subjective feeling of depression as intense as is the feeling of mania. Mania is characterized as the 'highest of highs' whereas depression is characterized by the 'lowest of lows.'
Suicide is a very real concern for the bipolar client, family, and friends, and those treating bipolar persons. In the course of antidepressant of bipolar disorder, or depression, the first symptoms that respond to treatment are a lack of energy (i.e., people become more energized) and sleep (i.e., people tend to sleep between when on antidepressants), and one of the last symptoms to clear up is mood. This makes people with Bipolar Disorder especially susceptible to suicide because they actually have the energy to kill themselves. States of high energy along with depression increase suicidal risk. <br>The <a data-href="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-of-mental-disorders-(dsm).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</a> categorizes Bipolar and Related Disorders as: Bipolar I Disorder: Characterized by a manic episode lasting 7 days or longer Bipolar II Disorder: Characterized by a hypomanic episode lasting no more than 4 days. Cyclothymic Disorder: Characterized by hypomanic symptoms that would not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a hypomanic 'episode' and depressive symptoms that would not meet the full symptom criteria for a depressive 'episode.' This includes a lower level of intensity of both extremes, a lower level of frequency with symptoms occurring for 4 days compared to 7 days for a manic episode, and a subthreshold of symptoms necessary to meet the disorder. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder: Characterized by symptoms of mania precipitated by a particular medication or substance (e.g., illicit or prescribed) and Bipolar Disorder Related to a Medical Condition, in which symptoms of mania can be precipitated by a health-related condition. Mania becomes the primary symptom distinguishing Bipolar Disorder from other depressive disorders and causes significant 'impairment in social and occupational functioning,' as well as a disruption to family relationships and functioning, which is the general standard that distinguishes problematic behavior from a mental disorder. Prevalence rates for all Bipolar Disorders for adults are 3.9% over the lifetime with 2.6% of the adult population meeting diagnostic criteria in a given year and 2.5% of adolescents meeting them over the lifetime with 2.2% of the population meeting criteria in a given year. Approximately 1.7% of adolescents report having mania along during the lifetime, and 1.3% report having manic symptoms in a given year. 50% to 67% of adults reported the onset of Bipolar Disorder before the age of 18 and 15% to 28% reported experiencing symptoms before 13 years. There is some evidence suggesting that women experience Bipolar II Disorder at a higher rate. Women also tend to experience higher 'rapid cycling' (i.e., four or more mood episodes within a single year) and more 'mixed states' (i.e., mixed symptoms or 'features' of mania and depression within a single episode) than men. Bipolar Disorder with Mixed Features is especially difficult to treat with psychotropic medication because of the nature of simultaneous manic and depressive symptoms. There is a hereditary component in Bipolar Disorder, 'A family history of Bipolar Disorder is one of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for Bipolar Disorders.'
Over 90% of those experiencing a manic episode eventually have recurring episodes and roughly 60% of individuals having a manic episode also have a depressive episode, so the likelihood is high that mania persists within individuals with multiple episodes, including episodes of depression. The persistence of symptoms within the interepisode phases of the illness indicates that, for many, there is never a break within this chronic condition. Depressive episodes in the bipolar cycle are much more difficult to treat and that individuals spend much more time in depressive states than manic ones; research suggests as much as three times as many weeks during the year with depressive symptoms versus symptoms of mania. Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, often debilitating condition that requires a multifaceted treatment approach to manage effectivity.
<br>For both adults and adolescents, symptoms of Bipolar Disorder can be comorbid with a wide variety of other disorders including <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> (including specific phobias), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, serious and often untreated medical conditions, and, for adolescents, disruptive and/or conduct disorder, and 'disorders with prominent irritability.' The primary treatment of Bipolar Disorder is psychopharmacologic, and typically starts with lithium bicarbonate and other mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics and anxiolytics that are often prescribed in the acute phase of the illness. Because individuals with Bipolar Disorder often have sleep disturbance, sleep medications are often prescribed to regulate circadian rhythms. Good sleep hygiene is one of the easiest and best ways to help prevent triggering mania. The use of electroconvulsive therapy is an option for entrenched, severe, and persistent depressive symptoms. A common and frustrating feature of medication treatment for bipolar individuals is medication compliance. Individuals affected with Bipolar Disorder often find the effects of drug therapy as blunting the euphoric effects of the experience of mania, and develop abhorrence to the side effects of the medication. They are also often resistant to the idea that they will be taking medications for the rest of their lives in order to maintain a balances mood, to help them make reasoned choices, maintain their interpersonal relationships, and support systems, and lower the incidence of additional and severe episodes. Re-hospitalizations for bipolar patients was lowest in the multifamily group, and the researchers pointed to the potential that patients may have learned to see themselves as less of a burden on family members, to experience more support from others (especially their own families), to feel less isolated, and to feel enhanced hope in learning how to cope more successfully with their condition. Family and social relationships are central to the affected person's ability to live successfully with this condition. Individuals experiencing manic and depressive symptoms reflect the bewilderment, anger, hopelessness, and existential despair often felt in family members who struggle to support their impacted loved one while at the same time trying to make sense of what is difficult to accept: that their loved one has a chronic condition that will persist throughout their life and, as family members, they too travel a parallel path. The tangible consequences include being introduced into the legal system with adolescent or adult family members who may act out during a manic episode and violate the law. Other potential, practical consequences include unemployment resulting from inconsistent or poor job performance; impulsive and poor financial decisions resulting in loss of income, savings, or retirement resources; loss of social status within the community; interfacing with mental health agencies and social services and a wide variety of mental health personnel; and often being marginalized by a mental health system that does not recognize the legitimate burden family members carry and the inability to access important treatment information on behalf of their affected loved one because of right to privacy and confidentiality. Sometimes partners of spouses, sons and daughters of parents, and parents of children may cut off and/or leave or divorce the impacted relative because of the stress attendant to this condition. These life disruptions cast a pall on other family and social activities and center the collective energy and family resources on addressing the problem. It is difficult to maintain hope in the future under these conditions. The intangible or emotional fallout for the family is a real and felt experience and centers on working to accept the disorder and attendant consequences. When an affected individual is in a manic state, family members may initially find the observed behavior as interesting or exciting, but soon turn to distress and anxiety as their loved one becomes more impulsive, unpredictable, and erratic; the family member may leave and not return home for days. If the manic episode is new to family members, there is often confusion about how to respond and about the immediate need for perspective. Often, family members seek to discern differences between the illness and the characteristics of the affected loved one in an attempt to make sense of their behaviors. If the affected individual is a parent, children and other family members need reassurance; if a child, parents may seek to discipline or reason with their loved one with little success. Some become violent, destructive, and/or manifest delusional and psychotic symptoms that are frightening, and family members are faced with having to protect and be protected from the affected family member. If the manic episode is repeated as part of the course of the illness, family members become retraumatized to the episode and may seek equilibrium through a variety of behaviors, ranging from acting out themselves (mostly in children) to calm responding to the situation and following a predetermined plan. Often family members try to reason with the affected member with little success. During episodes of depression, family members seek to motivate and instill hope within their family member and often face their own sense of hopelessness and despair when attempts to support, encourage, and offer solutions are rejected or treated with indifference. "One's attention is focused on the wellbeing of the person with Bipolar Disorder in such a way that one's own needs take second place. Being closely related to someone with Bipolar Disorder also means simultaneously foreseeing and following the often sudden and unexpected changes of the person with Bipolar Disorder." The DSM system is based on a medical model and is inherently limited in validating treatment approaches other than medical. <br>The <a data-href="Cultural Formulation Interview" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/cultural-formulation-interview.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cultural Formulation Interview</a> provides a framework to assist clinicians in assessing the cultural identity of the affected individual, perceptions of the distress (including how the cultural group of the client would view the problem), psychosocial stressors and 'cultural features of vulnerability and resilience,' and cultural aspects of both the client and the clinician that might impact treatment. Viewing culture therapeutically includes a perceptual expansion of cultural groups to include age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, occupation, military service, social networks, substance use, migration status, geographical region, relationship status (i.e., married or divorced), and not simply race and ethnicity. Though Bipolar Disorder presents with similar incidence in men and women across races and cultures, there is some observable difference in the course and progression of the disorder. This is due primarily to differences in initial diagnosis, access to treatment, and perceptions of stigma associated with mental health. <br>Comparing individuals with Bipolar Disorder from African ancestry with those with European ancestry, a trend was observed in the misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, most often as <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. It is possible that behaviors observed in minority patients during a manic phase are more commonly misconstrued as psychotic rather than manic. Another possibility for the misdiagnosis of schizophrenia in minority patients with Bipolar Disorder may be related to fears associated with seeking mental health services and an inherent mistrust of a system that has historically oppressed and marginalized them. Presenting as extremely guarded, paranoid, or having a blunt affect - all common symptoms of schizophrenia - may be rational expressions resulting from their previous experience of racism. Minority groups are disproportionately affected by challenges to healthcare access and experience greater stigmatization for seeking mental health services. Some minority groups may be disproportionately affected by environmental factors and social inequities, which may directly and indirectly contribute to both the development and progression of Bipolar Disorder. It is advocated that clinicians use empathy and authenticity when working with Bipolar Disorder clients, and to not be afraid of conflict within the process of making therapeutic contact. "The meeting and initial work with manic persons is often complicated. When we meet with them, we collide with them. We have to confirm the collision, not deny it." Demonstrating empathy for paranoid and grandiose thinking is not only critical for a successful therapeutic alliance, but gives the clinician a more accurate assessment as to the extent of the client's delusions, grandiosity, and paranoia. Counselors modeling for clients a sense of humor and often a playful attitude in their interactions together help clients learn to more realistically view themselves and reality-test relationships. Humor, appropriately and skillfully used, also helps reinforce for clients that their counselors do not view them as a culmination of their manic and depressive episodes, but as people who can be related to, which is empowering to them. Bipolar-affected clients often know that they negatively impact loved ones and others, and, as a result, feel deep shame and guilt for what is often irritating and offensive behavior, having a place that is safe for them to explore different ways of seeing themselves is important. The job of the clinician: First, to seek to existentially be with manic patients and then, to counterprojectively give perspective to those patients about their manic worldview, without completely denying it. This can lead to a healthy therapeutic alliance, which itself has a mood-stabilizing effect. Along with mood-stabilizing medications, this alliance can lead patients towards full recovery. The therapeutic relationship provides a place where the bipolar client can experience acceptance and the family can receive real and targeted support. It is important therapists show patience and adaptibility in working with patients with Bipolar Disorder and their families. Self-esteem, belief in one's own efficacy, and engendering hope for the present and future functioning is vital for those suffering from Bipolar Disorder. This awareness on the part of the therapist guides treatment and ameliorates the dysfunctional beliefs, the black-and-white thinking, and blunts the corrosive effects of mania and depression. Counselors should directly involve the family in the treatment of the identified family member with Bipolar Disorder. Family members can often provide much more accurate and rich perspectives regarding what happens when the family member with Bipolar Disorder is manic and/or severely depressed. Counselors can help clients with Bipolar Disorder to develop 'advanced directives' that may include signed consent from clients about how the illness is to be addressed or treated, including being treated against their will if they are in a full-blown manic or depressed episode. We want clients with Bipolar Disorder to be thinking about the course of their illness and making decisions about treatment when they are balanced, lucid, and making rational judgements rather than when they are manic or depressed. This can best be accomplished within the context of supportive family members who can express understanding and empathy, while at the same time express clearly the consequences of clients' manic and depressive behaviors and advocate strongly for responsive and responsible actions to be take. Genetic, biological, and environmental factors do not appear independent of each other but all 'interact in bringing about episodes of mood disorder or in protecting against their occurrence.' Understanding how these factors mutually impact and are impacted by each other over the course of the disorder can help manage episode occurrence and develop resilience in affected individuals and their families. Genetic and biological vulnerability includes the manifestation of the disorder in members of an affected person's family (i.e., who in the family has or has had the bipolar or related disorders), brain functioning (i.e., to what level may there be structural or brain abnormalities and quality of functioning and dysfunction in neurotransmitters), and other biological factors (e.g., chemical imbalances, changes in hormonal and immune system functioninig, sleep regulation). When vulnerability is high in these areas, the amount of environmental stress needed to trigger a manic or deppressive episode tends to be low. Those with high vulnerability have a low tolerance for and little protection form events that others without the disorder might manage quite well. Those with low vulnerability to genetic, neurologic, and biological factors would likely not be vulnerable to mood episodes unless there were high social stressors at play. Low environmental stress acts as a protective factor from the occurrence and reoccurrence of mood episodes. Because the nature of genetic or biological vulnerability may be hard to detect and determine, managing environmental stress becomes a high priority in treating and managing bipolar episodes and their severity. Psychosocial Provoking Agents: Largely impact vulnerability and the manifestation of manic and depressive states. Because Bipolar Disorder impacts individuals and families in often unpredictable and disorientating ways, and because of the consequences within the family, family members often assume patterns of responsing that range form being long-suffering, helpful, and supportive to being critical, blaming, and something uncooperative. These reactions contribute significantly to the emotional climate within the home and impact the perpetuation of continued episodes. 'Cause and Effect relationships between mood disorder symptoms and family environmental factors are bidirectional: Families are affected by Bipolar Disorder as much as they affect it.' The Vulnerability-Stress Model was developed from research on family interactions with patients with schizophrenia. Emotional Expression (EE) is a measure of emotional attitudes among relatives of a psychiatric patient. It is defined as critical, hostile, or emotional overinvolvement statements and attitudes family members communicate overtly or indirectly to the member (s) affected by the disorder. High EE Level within Family (Z 63.8) captures this dynamic. Individuals with Bipolar Disorder are two or three times more likely to deteriorate into a manic or deppressive episode in families where high EE exists and experience prolonged and more severe manic or depressive states.
High EE causes stress that contributes significantly to the perpetuation of mood episodes. EE develops and is perpetuated between the affected child and their parents. The child reinforces high EE reactions within parents, which impacts all relationship functioning. Children who exhibit behaviors and attitudes consistent with a low tolerance for stress, unstable mood, elevated anxiety, irritability, and problematic cognitive functionining largely meet the criteria for high biological and generic bulnerability. Generational influences within high EE families can significantly impact the vulnerabilities of family members who may be predisposed to Bipolar Disorder and bulnerable to criticism toward their condition. The Vulnerability-Stress Model helps clinicians assess and further understand not only the relationships between genetic, biological, and socioenvironmental factors, but helps focus attention on the EE and the quality of interpersonal reactions in the home that could be either provoking manic or depressive mood states or protecting affected individuals from their recurrence. Assessments for Bipolar Disorder are characterized as the individual assessment and diagnosis of the disorder while family assessment addresses essential aspects of the family environment including the quality of family interactions. A thorough biopsychosocial assessment should be conducted on the client upon the initial intake (or shortly thereafter) to capture a comprehensive context in which the presenting problems occur. All biopsychosocial assessments should include: Mental health history
Medical family history
Personal history that includes a developmental timeline
Conducting a mental status exam (i.e., appearance, behaviors/psychomotor activity, attitudes affect and mood, intelligence, and reliability, judgement, and insight)
Legal problems
Substance use
Spirituality/religion
Cultural/ethnic background
Suicidal ideation (including ideation, plan, attempts)
Financial concerns and socioeconomic status
Resources and Resiliency factors
Utilizing the Level I and Level II Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures associated with the DSM-5 can also provide a targeted assessment of symptoms, including the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale. Another helpful measure that can detect both threshold and subthreshold levels of mania is the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Bipolar Disorder Screening Scale. The goal of individual assessment is to obtain a differential diagnosis; it is important to: (a) administer formal assessments ethically and according to the protocols specified in specific instruments including being trained in the administration and interpretation of data
(b) gather and make sense of the data and share the results with clients in a manner that is comprehensible, clearly explaining the eliminations of assessment and assessment results. (c) use the data to confirm existing clinical impressions and/or to generate new clinical directions. Consultation with other professionals, including those of a treatment team is essential. The family can provide important context for the counselor in diagnosis and treatment, which leads to the process of family assessment. As part of the protocol of a comprehensive family assessment with all willing family members present, the counselor have the family (or a family member and the affected bipolar member) engage in conversation regarding their relationships or how they have attempted to solve problems they experience for 5 to 10 minutes and to observe and note the number of EE statements that are generated within the interaction and what the statements are. This gives important data about the level of EE, but sensitizes counselors to what family members value, what they may be struggling with, and the process and context of their conversations. <br>Developing sensitivity to the quality and types of interactions family members have can give counselors useful information in designing treatment, including the <a data-href="Genogram" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genogram</a>, which can be used to develop an understanding of where Bipolar Disorder (and other mental health problems) has occurred within the family. A genogram is a multigenerational family tree that symbolically represents different dynamics related to family and individual functioning that is psychologic, cultural, and interpersonal in nature. The Mood Disorder Burden Index was developed to assess caregiver perceptions and experiences in three core domains: patient mood symptoms, caregiver's worries about the future, and caregivers' interpersonal difficulties with the patient. The Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale: A self-administered instrument designed as an alternative to psychiatric measures that fail to assess for treatment outcome and recovery and well-being for those afflicted with Bipolar Disorder. It can give counselors insight into how the individual with Bipolar Disorder has been impacted by the disorder and, indirectly, how the family has been impacted. Counselors should always be mindful of being client centered, empathically inquisitive, and validating of the subjective experience of clients and their families as information is gathered during the assessment process. Assessment is a continuous process of measuring symptom reduction, improvement in family communication and problem-solving, acceptance, and self-efficacy living with Bipolar Disorder. Pharmacological intervention with an integration of individual psychotherapy is more effective than either protocol alone. Goals for treatment have focused on symptom reduction and prevention of future episodes. Psychosocial stressors can directly contribute to, or even catalyze, the occurrence of a bipolar episode. The occurrence of an episode can aggravate psychosocial stressors. Broader systemic influences including systemic racism, poverty, a global health crisis can all put a strain on an individual's ability to regulate emotion, something that is particularly difficult for individuals with Bipolar Disorder. A cycle can develop of constant challenge and crisis, which may self-perpetuate without the disruption of systemic treatment. Treatment of Bipolar Disorder should take an integrative approach to best serve the client's needs which invariably includes family systems work. Bipolar Disorder actually comprises a group of heterogeneous disorders, with significant variations in etiology, manifestation, and severity. The questions becomes not whether family systems treatment is or is not effective for Bipolar Disorder, but how and when it can be applied and adapted according to the needs of the client and family. FFT is an integrative approach to treatment of Bipolar Disorder, which combines psychoeducation and family therapy. It has been shown to enhance family cohesion and reduce family conflict. FFT begins with a thorough assessment of individual symptomology and family systems dynamics, and proceeds through a structured and preset treatment, with specific goals throughout the duration. Important elements of assessment: Gather as much information during intake as possible. Identify family conflicts that may be contributing to the stress across the system, which in turn can exacerbate Bipolar Disorder symptomology in the identified client. Determine the presence and severity of other environmental stressors - such as low socioeconomic status, experiences of oppression and marginalization, or experiences of extreme stress or trauma - which can impact family members individually as well as the relationships across the system. Understand the strengths and protective factors across the system that can support the emotional regulation of the individual with Bipolar Disorder, as well as the overall health of the family system. This information informs both the psychoeducation and therapy components of treatment, as it guides both specific goals and interventions. Understand the clients' cultural beliefs, practices, and influences on the family system. This is important to not only to provide a context to the experiences and dynamics of the system, but also to provide the counselor with a perspective on how FFT may need to be adapted somewhat to maximize efficacy. Determine appropriateness of the type of intervention. The extremes of bipolar episodes cause significant conflict in family systems, and may make some or all members unwilling to participate. Not all individuals are appropriate for the FFT protocol. Persons who are in acute phases of Bipolar Disorder, have developmental disabilities or other biological conditions that impact cognition, refuse to adhere to medication protocols or have a comorbid active substance use disorder are among those for whom FFT is not recommended. FFT is an effective treatment for Bipolar Disorder and its use can significantly impact relapse of the disorder. Higher rates of anxiety, depression, and general distress were found in caregivers of those diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Family-based interventions improve illness outcome and caregiver well-being. FFT has been found to have a positive impact on the mental health of caregivers, even when the diagnosed family member is not participating in the treatment. The course of treatment of FFT for Bipolar Disorder is fairly structured and is based on three treatment stages: (a) psychoeducation, (b) communication enhancement training (CET), and (c) problem solving. Treatment using FFT usually lasts approximately 9 months, and is structured around 21 sessions that generally generally begin following an acute phase of Bipolar Disorder. Clinical sessions are conducted weekly for the first 3 months, followed by a step-down to bi-weekly, then once per month. The philosophy of FFT is that Bipolar Disorder is experienced by the family, not just by the diagnosed client. As Bipolar Disorder episodes are viewed as 'disaster' experiences shared by the family system, which in turn cause disequilibrium. The treatment is reestablishing balance and harmony to the system, which in turn supports the health and wellness of the diagnosed client. Counseling goals are identified early in treatment and are informed from intake and assessment sessions. FFT for Bipolar Disorder begins with 6 general goals that outline and guide the overall process: Integrate the experiences associated with episodes of Bipolar Disorder. The focus of this goal is to understanding the diagnostic features of Bipolar Disorder as well as the experience of it from the perspective of the diagnosed individual. It also helps family members accept both the severity and significance of the diagnosis. Accept the notion of a vulnerability to future episodes. The focus of this goal is in the recognition that Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, persistent, lifelong diagnosis that requires continual support. The diagnosed individual - as well as the family - may believe that the condition can be 'cured' and thus have an unrealistic expectation of treatment. The periods of stability that occur between episodes can often contribute to this incorrect assumption. Accept a dependency on mood-stabilizing medication for symptom control. Consistent use of mood-stabilizing medication can minimize the intensity of Bipolar Disorder episodes and prevent future occurences. The undesirable side effects of many medications can make the client less willing to maintain this portion of the treatment protocol. Distinguish between the client's personality and the Bipolar Disorder. Over time, the diagnosed individual may be viewed by family members solely through the lens of the disorder. This can lead to inaccurate assumptions about the meaning and importance of behaviors. Recognize and learn to cope with stressful life events that trigger recurrences of Bipolar Disorder. FFT is based on the Vulnerability-Stress Model. This model includes both an understanding of preexisting biological conditions that create vulnerability and the environmental stimuli that trigger or catalyze reactions based on this vulnerability. While biological components cannot be altered, clients and families should understand how psychosocial stressors such as conflictual relationships, major life changes, and severe emotional stressors can impact the vulnerability of an individual with Bipolar Disorder. Reestablish functional relationships after the episode. The key features of this goal are support and connection. The before, during, and after phases of Bipolar Disorder episodes can be aggravated by the conflicts that arise across family systems in response to the situation. A goal for treatment is enhancing communication patterns within the family system and providing families with coping skills. In the initial stage of treatment using the FFT model, the primary goal is psychoeducation. This stage is broken down into phases with focus on different informational needs. In the beginning, the clinician imparts a great deal of vital information to the family system. It is important for this to be done in a warm, interactive manner. Clinicians using FFT must be aware of the potential for this stage to devolve into a solely instructional experience and take intentional, conscious steps to avoid this. Continually checking in with family members and encouraging discussion about the material can minimize this risk and enhance rapport with family members. In the beginning of the psychoeducation stage, the clinician should provide an overview of the FFT protocol, reasons for family participation, and the role of the clinician in the treatment process. Treatment goals should also be addressed, both the general FFT-based goals and the specific goals for the family system. This is also a good time to provide an overview of Bipolar symptomology, as well as prodromal symptoms and environmental triggers. The clinician should take the time to explore the unique experiences and perspectives of each family member. Often it is the associated meaning for the system members that impacts the manner in which they cope with and react to a Bipolar Disorder episode. Discussions around environmental triggers are an important way for families to better understand the blind spots they may have regarding the diagnosed family member's vulnerabilities. Events that may be considered minor, benign, or otherwise simply normal life events to some family members may prove to be substantially more stressful for the family member with Bipolar Disorder. A lack of empathy for the different experiences of the family member with Bipolar Disorder may also create conflict, as the affected family member may feel unsupported and misunderstood. <br>The DSM-5-TR <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of excessive or paralyzing fear and/or intense anxiety with associated disturbances in behavior. More adults were reporting anxiety-related symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic while more youths reported anxiety-related symptoms by the end of 2020. Various factors such as fear for the health and welfare of themselves and their families, inconsistent daily routines including school closures, and mounting tension in their homes have led to increased reports of anxiety in children. Despite experiencing anxiety-related symptoms to be diagnosed the individual must exhibit symptoms of significant distress or impairment across multiple domains in functioning (e.g., familial, social, academic, or occupational). <br><a data-href="Anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of intense fear or anxiety, avoidance of feared stimulus, and can cause life interferences, emotional distress, and impaired functioning. <br>The distinguishing features differentiating the DSM-5-TR <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> are the focus of each anxiety disorder or the core feared stimuli, and the focus of the fear informing the other individual domains of focus in the DSM. These domains include: Cognitive Response The cognitive response for the anxiety disorders is worry. Individuals with anxiety tend to exhibit two cognitive errors: Overestimating the probability of a negative event (i.e., thinking a negative event or outcome is much more likely to happen than objective reality)
Catastrophizing (i.e., thinking the worst-case scenario will happen) Physical Response The physical component is the physical response to fear such as muscle tension, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, and other symptoms associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Behavioral Response The behavioral response to anxiety is the active avoidance of the feared stimuli. In SAD (social phobia), the core feature is the fear of negative evaluation by others. It follows that across the other individual domains the core feature of fear, anxiety, or both would be consistent. An individual meeting criterion for SAD would fear being evaluated by others (core focus of their anxiety; cognitive component). The individual may sweat, tremble, or experience heart palpitations (physical component) as well as avoid giving speeches or talking in class (behavioral component). Anxiety disorders represent one of the highest prevalent disorders within children and adults. It is estimated that 15%-20% of children and adolescents are affected by an anxiety disorder. An estimated 40 million adults in the US have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. <br><a data-href="Lifetime Prevalence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/lifetime-prevalence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lifetime Prevalence</a> is the percentage of individuals who meet criteria for a disorder during their lifetime. <br><a data-href="Point Prevalence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/point-prevalence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Point Prevalence</a> is the percentage of individuals who meet criteria for a disorder during a specific period of time. Anxiety disorders severely impair physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, academic functioning, and the overall quality of life of an individual. Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are sick more days from work and have lower work productivity. Individuals with anxiety disorders are common patrons of primary care settings, specialty clinics, and emergency room services. Individuals with anxiety disorders have higher rates of relationship distress and divorce. <br>A <a data-href="Risk Factor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Risk Factor</a> is defined as any attribute, characteristic, or experience that increases the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder. A risk factor and the root cause of an anxiety disorder may differ greatly; therefore, having a risk factor is not the same as causing an anxiety disorder. Genetics or hereditability increases risk for all of the anxiety disorders. Individuals with first-degree relatives (e.g., parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder are at an increased risk to develop an anxiety disorder. 30% to 40% of variance in the anxiety disorders is due to genetics. Other risk factors contribute more than half of the variance to the development of anxiety disorders. <br>A strong link between the <a data-href="Temperament" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/temperament.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Temperament</a> style that is of <a data-href="Behavioral Inhibition (BI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-inhibition-(bi).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavioral Inhibition (BI)</a> and anxiety disorders.

Most temperaments are inherited, and family members are also likely to have similar temperaments. Parents are likely to model and reinforce their child's tendency toward BI or emotionality. Stressful life events and trauma relate to an increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder, such as early parental loss, childhood abuse, previous trauma, and peer victimization. Anxiety disorders are often maintained by several individual factors. An individual factor is identified as something that is internal or based on the individual as opposed to a family or societal factor that maintains anxiety disorders. The individual factors and systemic factors influence one another in a reciprocal manner. An individual's behavioral response and cognitions develop within the context of their family. <br>Several behavioral factors have been linked to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. <a data-href="Behavioral Avoidance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-avoidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavioral Avoidance</a> maintains all of the anxiety disorders. In the short term, behavioral avoidance is a coping strategy that temporarily relieves anxiety; however, long-term behavioral avoidance is a key factor in maintaining all anxiety disorders. Many times the larger system, either the family or school, reinforces behavioral avoidance of feared stimuli. Cognitive factors that maintain anxiety are the thoughts and thinking styles contributing to maintaining an anxiety disorder. <br><a data-href="Attentional Bias" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/attentional-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attentional Bias</a> for threat maintains anxiety disorders. Individuals with an anxiety disorder tend to pay more attention to stimuli that appear threatening to them, and they have difficulty noticing anything else other than the perceived threatening stimuli. Individuals with anxiety disorders perceive neutral stimuli as dangerous compared to individuals without an anxiety disorder. <br>A second cognitive factor related to the maintenance of anxiety disorders is <a data-href="Cognitive Avoidance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-avoidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive Avoidance</a>. Attentional bias and cognitive avoidance are internal processes; however, the family system or larger systems influence the internal process of attentional bias and cognitive avoidance. Many parents model attention bias for children. Parent may model cognitive avoidance, teaching their children to respond in the same manner. In adult romantic relationships, a partner may influence the process of cognitive avoidance as well. The majority of research on the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders focuses on the individual variables or individual therapy. Relational factors related to the etiology or maintenance of anxiety disorders: <br><a data-href="Relationship Quality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/relationship-quality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Relationship Quality</a> Lower relationship quality within the couple or family system relates to anxiety disorders.
Couple conflict, lower relationship satisfaction, and couple violence all correlate with adult anxiety disorders. Couple distress has been linked to an increased risk in developing an adult anxiety disorder. Conflict between parents consistently relates to childhood anxiety disorders. Individuals within a relationship who experience high attachment anxiety will often question their partner and behave in hypersensitive ways in an effort to avoid rejection which increases relationship distress. <br><a data-href="Communication" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/communication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication</a>

Sexual health is shaped by the interaction of a person's unique biological, psychologic, and cultural experiences and has significant impacts on mental, emotional, and relational well-being. Earlier editions of the DSM were also critiqued for omitting gendered differences in sexual functioning.

Clinical judgement is urged in ruling out the following causal factors: Inadequate sexual stimulation
Cultural factors that may impact the experience of pleasure
Problems better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, substance use, a medical condition, or by several relational distress, partner violence or other stressors. The DSM-5-TR uses the subtypes of lifelong, acquired, generalized, and situational to designate the onset of the sexual problem. A variety of factors that should be considered during diagnostic assessment include: Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems; partner's health status)
Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication; discrepancies in desire for sexual activity)
Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement)
Cultural or religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity or pleasure, and attitudes toward sexuality)
Medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code for the relationship problem or stressor may be listed. The usefulness of reframing the term dysfunction as a 'sexual concern,' 'issue,' or 'challenge' in the effort to depathologize sexual difficulties and adopt a more normalizing perspective when discussing sexual issues with clients. Modalities of family/relationship systems therapy (e.g., internal family systems, Imago therapy, and emotionally focused therapy) to support the treatment of sexual issues for individuals and relationships.

In the United States, societal sexual norms are often extensions of cisgender, heterosexual, White, patriarchal, Judeo-Christian, and able-bodied assumptions of sexuality. For this reason, many individuals - especially those with historically marginalized identities - develop an internalized sexual worldview that lies in contrast with their own sexual realities. This incongruence can lead to misinformation about one's sexuality, internalized shame, insecurity, and a myriad of other barriers that may negatively impact sexual functioning, sexual pleasure, and sexual communication and negotiation with partners. Culturally or religiously imposed values can shape a person's emotional experience related to sexuality in meaningful ways that can hinder and/or support one's sexual well-being.
<br><a data-href="Intersectionality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/intersectionality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intersectionality</a> - which posits that individuals hold multiple, intersecting social and cultural identities, each carrying certain privileges and oppressions given the individual's broader sociocultural and political landscape. Counselors seek to understand the ways in which a client's complex experience of power and oppression shapes their sexual functioning, as well as to explore the client's unique protective and risk factors given their multifaceted identities. Even in instances when sexual concerns are not the primary reason for seeking counseling, sexual assessment provides the clinician with an important opportunity to assess for possible comorbidity with presenting issues, better understand the client's cultural and relational values, and normalize the presence of sexual discussion amidst the counseling process. General sexual wellness assessment can be included in initial intake paperwork, as well as in follow-up sessions once therapeutic rapport has been established. Examples include: How would you currently describe your overall sexual wellness?
What concerns, if any, do you currently have about your sex life or current level of sexual satisfaction?
On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), how would you currently rate your sexual wellness? How did you arrive at that number? What changes would you like to see in that number? Are there any issues related to your sexual health and wellness that you would like to discuss in counseling? For couples, general sexual wellness assessment can include other items on couple intimacy and sexual wellness. Examples include: How would you currently rate your sexual intimacy today? How does that compare to other times in your relationship?
If you could have any changes to your current sexual relationship, what would you hope to see?
How do you define physical intimacy in your relationship? How important is physical intimacy to your overall relationship health?
How might your sexual relationships be related to your primary reasons for seeking couples counseling at this time? Counselors can help clients with initial discomfort by emphasizing: Sexuality is a normal and natural element of human existence
Sexual health often has important implications for clients' mental health and may assist the counselor in providing holistic and informed mental healthcare
Clients are free to answer only those questions that they feel comfortable answering, and they are also welcome to respond at a later time. Following an intersystemic framework, counselors can approach sexual assessment systematically and contextually. An intersectional systemic approach, 'balances attention to the individual, couple, and family system, as well as the larger systems in which we live.'
This framework outlines the five domains impacting client sexual wellness: Individual-biological/medical
Individual-psychologic
Dyadic relationship or couple dynamics
Intergenerational influences
Contextual factors such as society, culture, history, religion, and physical/geographic environment. The first level of assessment, individual-biological/medical, is aimed at understanding what if any, underlying biological and/or medical issues might be causing the sexual issue, including causes related to natural aging and developmental hormonal changes. People who have recently given birth may experience hormonal shifts that limit sexual desire, which may also be connected to culturally deprived beliefs about sexuality and motherhood related to reduced sexual drive. Examples include: Do you currently have any physical issues and/or medical conditions? How has this impacted your sexual wellness and functioning?
Are you currently taking any medications? What affect, if any, does this medication ahve on your sexual wellness and functioning?
Has disability impacted your sexual wellness? If so, how?
How has your sexual wellness and functioning changed as you have aged? Even if no medical/biological issue is reported, referral to a medical doctor or sexual health specialist (if the client has not done so already) is advised if sexual issues are present that appear to be biologically/physiologically based. The second level of assessment is individual-psychologic, which assesses potential psychological factors for sexual dysfunction, including comorbidity with existing and prior mental health issues. Psychotropic medications used to treat mental health issues can also interrupt sexual functioning. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., SSRIs) have been shown to further induce sexual side effects, such as lowered libido, and arousal/orgasm difficulties. Assessment questions of the psychologic dynamics of sexual dysfunction include: Have you previously experienced mental health issues? If so, what was the impact of those issues on your sexual wellness?
How does your mood typically impact your libido and sexual functioning?
When you feel (client's mental health symptoms), how does that tend to impact your sexual well-being? How, if at all, does your sexual desire and ability to experience pleasure shift when your symptoms are at their worst? Over the course of treatment, it is recommended to regularly monitor any changes in the client's sexual function as an additional point of insight into the client's overall mental health, as well as to establish a timeline of the sexual problem. The counselor will assess the relational dynamics of the sexual issue, which includes relational attachment, conflict history, communication, intimacy, and the presence of intimate partner violence (IPV). The goals of relational assessment are for the client(s) and counselor to explore how the dynamics of the relationship may be contributing to the sexual issue, as well as how each individual partner is coping with the presence of sexual difficulties. Common areas to explore include the client's sexual history with their current partner, communication strategies used by the client(s) when discussing sexual issues with their partners, and patterns of initiating, negotiating, and engaging in sexual activities. A sexual history assessment may also be a helpful tool in discovering the couple's shared and individual levels of sexual knowledge, communication patterns, and sexual desires/interests.
Example items for sexual history assessment include: How did you first become sexually intimate with your partner? How would you describe your initial sexual connection? How has this changed over time?
What types of sexual activities do you and your partner engage in?
What types of partners and solo activities give you the most pleasure?
How would you like to see your sexual relationships change or grow?
How is sex initiated in your relationship? How do each of you respond when you're interested in sex, but your partner isn't?
How do you communicate your sexual needs and desires to your partner?
What challenges do you face, if any, in talking to your partner about sex? The sexual worldview of individuals in a relationship may also have significant impacts on the quality of sex in the relationship, as well as the quality of the total relationship. Sexual problems can cause physical and emotional distress, shame, and embarrassment during sexual encounters, which can inhibit the level of satisfaction and pleasure derived by all partners. How do you feel when you're experiencing the sexual issue?
How does your partner respond to you when you're experiencing the sexual issue?
What are your major fears or insecurities about this issue?
How, if at all, are these fears related messages you received about gender/race/sexuality growing up? An imbalance of power (e.g., physical, emotional, financial, and/or childcare responsibilities) in the relationship can create challenges to the development of trust and intimacy, which can affect the sexual relationship and can further affect the individual's sexual functioning. Before addressing the sexual wellbeing of the relationship, existing violence and/or severe conflict would first need to be addressed. Example items to assess the presence of relational distress and violence include: How do you typically address, navigate, and resolve conflict in your relationship?
How does your relationship typically handle jealousy, anger, and resentment?
When, if ever, have you experienced physical or emotional violence in your relationship?
How does conflict tend to impact your sexual relationship with your partner? <br>The <a data-href="Genogram" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genogram</a>, which allows for the clinician to interview the client, sketch out family patterns of relating through generations, and assess the client's present difficulties from an intergenerational point of view. By creating a genogram with the client or couple, the counselor can locate patterns of <a data-href="Enmeshment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enmeshment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enmeshment</a>, <a data-href="Emotional Cutoff" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-cutoff.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Cutoff</a>, and <a data-href="Triangulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangulation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangulation</a> that may be connected to the sexual issues experienced by the client or couple. The genogram allows the couple to understand the sexual issue from a more contextual and systemic perspective, which can initiate new, more functional patterns of relating. In this way, the genogram is both an assessment tool and an intervention strategy (McGoldrick, 2008) Questions on the sexual genogram focus on six core areas: Messages received about sexuality/intimacy and gender
Communication and behaviors related to sexuality
Sexual secrets
Lacking information
Each partner's response to the other's genogram
Goals for growth in the client's/couple's genogram. Sample items to include on the sexual genogram include: How did you first learn about sexuality?
How do members of your family, community, and cultural background(s) tend to view sexuality?
How did your caregivers and family members respond to your sexual development (e.g., secondary sex characteristics, masturbation, first dating experiences, and access to safer sex/family planning resources)?
Are there sexual events that are silenced or not talked about in your family-of-origin?
Have you previously experienced difficulties with your arousal or orgasm?
How have these difficulties impacted you and your partner(s)?
How do you feel about the look, smell, and taste of your genitals? How does this impact your sexual connection with your partner(s)?
What is the meaning/purpose of sex for you? The goals of this final level of assessment are for the client to gain awareness of impact of cultural values on their sexual wellness, as well as to affirm the unique resiliencies the client has developed in response to these overarching systems. Example items to include in the contextual assessment: How, if at all, did religion impact your understanding of sexuality growing up? How about your cultural backgrounds?
Which of your identities are most salient to you? What assumptions/expectations exist for each of your identities with respect to sex (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc.)?
How do members of your cultural background tend to view sex and gender? Masturbation? Sexual pleasure?
In what ways, if at all, have you felt like your sexual well-being was limited because of your identities?
What sexuality supports do you wish you had received as a young person?
What changes have you made to your personal understanding of sexuality throughout your life? What is most empowering about your current sexual worldview? Often when clients simply articulate the unspoken limitations of sex-negative value systems on their lives, they are empowered to update these perspectives in ways that are more congruent with their current ethical framework. A primary aim of family systems counseling is for the client to glean new insights into the relational dynamics in their life and to subsequently feel empowered to shift the boundaries, attachments, and communication patterns of those relationships that are not actively serving the client's mental and sexual wellness. The PLISSIT model describes four levels of care ranging from introductory to specialized - Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, and Intensive Therapy - which can be applied to client. The first level of care, permission, describes the counselor's role in giving the client express permission to discuss sexual issues in counseling, while emphasizing that sexuality is a normal, natural, and worthwhile topic of examination throughout a person's life. Permission-giving is intended to affirm clients' sexual well-being, destigmatize sexual discussion, and invite continued and ongoing sexual exploration throughout treatment. Often limited information is needed in order to provide the client with additional knowledge related to their specific sexual issue (i.e., psychoeducation).
Specific Suggestions may be required to improve the issue, such as giving a client a homework assignment to view their genitals in the mirror, practice sensate focus with their partner, or engage in a series of nonsexual touch exercises with their partner in the counseling office. (Counselors are recommended to join sexuality-specific organizations for additional learning opportunities such as the Association for Counseling Sexology and Sexual Wellness (ACSSW) and the American Association for Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT))
The final level of care, intensive therapy, ins indicated in situations when the client is not finding relief from previous levels of treatment, which often signals comorbidity with underlying trauma, mental illness, and/or addiction issues. The need for intensive therapy may also prompt referral to a certified sex therapist, sexologist, or some other sexual healthcare. PLISSIT is not used in lieu of an evidence-based treatment approach, but rather as a supplemental directive informing the progression of treatment. Sexual assessment should be invitational, responsive to the client's cultural background and comfort level, and expressly relevant to the client's presenting issues. Questions based on the counselor's personal, nontherapeutic curiosity should be avoided.
<br><a data-href="University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference</a> can occur when a client brings up a topic that has personal resonance with the counselor and in situations where the client or client's situation reminds the counselor of someone/something in their own life. Countertransference is a normative experience for counselors; however, the counselor's initial awareness of countertransference must be followed up with consultation, supervision, personal therapy, and/or continued education in order to prevent personal reactions from further impacting the therapeutic process.
Arousal can be a naturally occurring response to sexual discussion; however, it is important for the client and counselor to adhere to clear boundaries if arousal/attraction occurs. "Sexual discussion can often stir up a wide range of confusing and exciting emotions. Maintaining a professional counselor-client relationship is critical in keeping this space safe and sacred for you. "
"I am getting the sense that this conversation is exciting you right now. While that can be a common response to sharing intimate sexual details, I want to remind you of our professional boundaries. If you need a break from this conversation, you are welcome to step outside, grab some water, or reschedule for a later time." The importance of normalizing the existence of client attraction and focusing on creating opportunities aimed at supporting counselors as they establish and uphold boundaries, process 'forbidden' feelings, and practice enhanced bracketing skills with a peer or supervisor. Counselors must clearly communicate goals, priorities, and rationale for the decision to apply a sexual dysfunction diagnosis, as well as facilitate an informed discussion of the risks associated with sharing a diagnosis with an outside source, such as a health insurance company or in the case of a judicial subpoena. Before the client consents to formal diagnosis for healthcare coverage reasons, the counselor and client must collaboratively weight out the benefits and limitations of this formal documentation. <br><a data-href="Gender Assignment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Assignment</a>: At birth, doctors make an initial assessment of gender as either female or male <br><a data-href="Gender Identity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/gender-identity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Identity</a>: A category of social identity and refers to an individual's identification as male, female, or occasionally, some category other than male and female <br><a data-href="Cisgender" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cisgender</a>: When assigned gender and gender identity match <br><a data-href="Gender Expansiveness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Expansiveness</a>: There are many ways people can express and identify their gender expansiveness, such as gender nonconforming, gender queer, nonbinary, or a variety of other terms that indicate a gender identity falls outside of the traditional options of only male and female. <br><a data-href="Gender Transition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Transition</a>: Where persons take social and often medical steps to be seen externally as their gender identity.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder ‚Üí Panic Disorder ‚Üí Social Anxiety Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Separation Anxiety Disorder It is generalized anxiety disorder? (May also include Panic Attacks [specifier]) If not Common feature is excessive fear and and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. What differentiates the diagnosis? The types of objects/situations that induce fear, anxiety, and avoidance, and the associated cognitive ideation. Fear: The emotional response to real and perceived imminent threat.
Fear is associated with surges of automatic arousal, fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, escape behaviors. Anxiety: The anticipation of future threat.
Anxiety is associated with muscle tension, vigilance in preparation for future danger, caution, and avoidance behaviors. <a data-href="Anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety disorders</a> differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety. The anxiety is excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from transient or stress-induced anxiety by persistence (lasting 6+ months) Develop in childhood

Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event (s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) (Note: In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play)
Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event (s).
Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event (s).

Reckless or self-destructive behavior. Hypervigilance
Exaggerated startle response
Problems with concentration
Sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep) With dissociative symptoms: The individual's symptoms meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in response to the stressor, the individual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following: Depersonalization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of one's mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly). Derealization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant, or distorted). Note: To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medication condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). <br><img alt="Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/trauma-and-stressor-related-disorder.png" target="_self"> Adjustment disorders

Title: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5-TR, Editor: American Psychiatric Association,; Publisher: American Psychiatric Association Publishing,
Location: Washington, DC,
Year: 2022 ISBN: 978-0-89042-577-0
"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers. DSM-5-TR includes fully revised text and references, updated diagnostic criteria and ICD-10-CM codes since DSM-5 was published in 2013. It features a new disorder, prolonged grief disorder, as well as codes for suicidal behavior available to all clinicians of any discipline without the requirement of any other diagnosis. With contributions from over 200 subject matter experts, this updated volume boasts the most current text updates based on the scientific literature. Now in four-color and with the ability to authenticate each printed copy, DSM-5-TR provides a cohesive, updated presentation of criteria, diagnostic codes, and text. This latest volume offers a common language for clinicians involved in the diagnosis and study of mental disorders and facilitates an objective assessment of symptom presentations across a variety of clinical settings-inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. Important updates in DSM-5-TR include 1) fully revised text for each disorder with updated sections on associated features, prevalence, development and course, risk and prognostic factors, culture, diagnostic markers, suicide, differential diagnosis, and more; 2) addition of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) to Section II; 3) over 70 modified criteria sets with helpful clarifications since publication of DSM-5; 4) fully updated Introduction and Use of the Manual to guide usage and provide context for important terminology; 5) considerations of the impact of racism and discrimination on mental disorders integrated into the text; 6) new codes to flag and monitor suicidal behavior, available to all clinicians of any discipline and without the requirement of any other diagnosis; 7) fully updated ICD-10-CM codes implemented since 2013, including over 50 coding updates new to DSM-5-TR for substance intoxication and withdrawal and other disorders"--
Keywords: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; In Progress; Mental Disorders; classification; diagnosis The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continue to evolve.
Too rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... The degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder)
Clinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis.
The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress.
Reliable diagnoses are essential for: Guiding treatment
Identifying prevalence rates
Identifying clients for clinical research
Documenting public health information Physicians

Couple and Family Therapist It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Manic Episode A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness non-global-directed activity).
Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by related changes that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. (pg. 178)
What differs among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology. The presentation of children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol.
For children up to 12 years of age. Children with this symptom pattern typically develop unipolar depressive disorders or <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a>, rather than bipolar disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood. (pg. 178) Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. <br>The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>) <br>This diagnosis cannot coexist with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a>, or <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a>, though it can coexist with others, including <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Conduct Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/conduct-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Conduct Disorder</a>, and <a data-href="Substance Use Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/substance-use-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Substance Use Disorder</a> s. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. A diagnosis based on a single episode is possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of cases. <br>Careful consideration should be given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a> may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode of major depressive disorder.

Bereavement-related major depressive episodes tend to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diagnosis-(hdfs-8881)/readings/@americanpsychiatricassociationdiagnosticstatisticalmanual2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diagnosis (HDFS 8881)/Readings/@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2022.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 22:22:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[8. Accreditation and Legal Issues]]></title><description><![CDATA[ The idea of first year student being paired up with a second year therapist to help guide. Working with agencies? No surprises act: Giving clients an estimate about how much they are going to pay for services Struggle with terminating services. As long as file is open, you are legally their therapist. Case is closed because once the case is closed you are no longer their therapist. They can always come back. What will be different for you when we are ready to move on? What does it need to be life for this to end? We make a mistake of not planting that seed early on. When clients start thinking of me as a person, such as asking questions. When you are no longer in the therapist role, when you stop becoming a person's therapist and become a person to them. They begin to see you as yourself rather than a therapist. If you have not scheduled within 30 days, we would terminate and close their case. They can always call back. Purpose of accreditation: Ensure the quality of marriage and family therapy programs. Accredited programs meet or exceed all standards for accreditation. Standards for Accreditation: Version 12.5 Outcome Based Education (You have to show that your people are meeting target): Vs input based (You offer these courses, your people are confident). 360 Quality and Improvement Review Process
Start with Program goals, then student learning outcomes, and then targets for those outcomes. Review and gather data to show that you are meeting the targets or not and what you are doing to change the program to allow students to meet the SLO's If programs are accredited, licensure boards typically accept that they meet the educational requirements and client contact contact hour requirements for licensure (again, typically, always check with the state board) State of Ohio -&gt; 500 hour requirement
Board -&gt; 300 hour requirement Set standards for what adequate education and training is in the field. Protect students in those programs, knowing that they are able to be licensed in their state with that education, and protects the public in general, knowing that a therapist who graduated from an accredited program has the education and training needed to provide the service. Legal Age for Marriage in Ohio: 16 What are the Marriage Age Requirement Laws in Ohio? While females in Ohio may get married as young as 16 with the consent of both parents, only a juvenile court (in limiting cases) may consent to a marriage involving a male under 18. Same-sex marriage has been 'legal' and recognized in Ohio since 2015. Parentage: A man is presumed to be the natural father of a child in certain circumstances, including: The man and the child's mother are or have been married to each other, and the child is born during the marriage or is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated.
An acknowledgement of paternity has been filed pursuant to Sec. 3111.23
The term 'Punative Father' means a man, including one under age 18, who may be a child's father and to whom all of the following apply. He is not married to the child's mother at the time of the child's conception or birth. He has not adopted the child. He has not been determined, prior to the date a petition to adopt the child is filed, to have a parent and child relationship with the child by a court proceeding or an administrative agency proceeding. He has not acknowledged paternity of the child pursuant to Sec. 3111.21 to 3111.35. Understanding Divorce and Custody Issues: Dissolution vs. Divorce: Dissolution is when both parties can agree on all matters pertaining to separation (i.e., no fault divorce).
Divorce is when both parties can't come to an agreement. To get a no-fault divorce, you need to state in the Complaint for Divorce that 'that the parties are incompatible,' or 'the parties have been living separate and apart without cohabitation for 1 year.' The grounds of being incompatible can be defeated if your spouse denies incompatibility.
The fault-based grounds for divorce are bigamy, willful absence of the other party for 1 year, adultery, extreme cruelty, fraudulent contract, gross neglect of duty, habitual drunkness, imprisonment in a state or federal prison at the time of filing, and when the divorce decree of another state does not use any of these, since they had complexity to the process by requiring proof. If parties don't agree about custody agreements, the judge will decide based on child's best interest: The wishes of the parties,
The wishes of the child, if the judge interviewed the child in private, The child's adjustment to home, school, and community,
The mental and physical health of all persons involved, You may get subpoenaed, good idea to contact attorney and ask. If private practice, have attorney on retainer, The party more likely to honor and facilitate parenting time rights,
Whether either party failed to make all child support payments, including arrearages,
Whether either party or a household member was a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect, or a violent or sexually oriented offense involving a member of the family,
Whether either party has continuously and willfully, denied the other party's rights to parenting time in accordance with an an order of the court,
Whether either party has, or has plans to, establish a residence outside of Ohio. Other Considerations: The ability of the parties to cooperate and make decisions jointly,
Each party's ability to encourage contact between the child and the other party,
Any history of, or potential for, child abuse, domestic violence, or parental kidnapping,
The geographic proximity of the parties to each other, The recommendation of any guardian ad litem of the child Child support is determined by reference to the Ohio Child Support Guidelines and includes a chart to calculate the child's needs based upon the combined income of the parties. For example, if the combined income of you and your spouse is $96,000 Recommend learn the laws around divorce and custody in the state you are located in. Don't. (I am not unbiased) (There are training programs for this)
If you decide you want to do that work, then you are not also the therapist for the parties involved. Sometimes you may be asked to testify based on the work you have done with one of the parents, do your best not to. You can put that into your consent form, although might not be considered a legal document. Whenever there is a divorce with custody agreements about children, then you need to review those custody agreements and get the consent of parents who share custody with their children. If a parent has sole custody then their consent is enough. If there is shared custody, then both parents must provide consent to treatment, unless there is a stipulation in the custody agreement that says otherwise. You can work with child and parent of up to 6 session without consent. Can apply for social work and counselor jobs. 2022 Median Pay: $56, 570 60-65 with Masters, as you get your I, increases

As therapists, we know that reading is an integral part of our profession. A handful profoundly defined my identity as a therapist, but many of them felt dry, academic, and utterly disconnected from reality. If anything reading those books left me feeling even more insecure about my craft. Therapists have good intentions when they write books. But their message often becomes diluted - it becomes less about the nuances of personal development as a therapist and more about showcasing a series of their successes. Through my social media experience, I have gathered some basic assumptions about therapists: We often graduate from school feeling woefully unprepared.
We're scared we won't make any money. We (mostly) love the work we do.
We doubt ourselves constantly. We second-guess our career choice. We often feel unappreciated in the healthcare system. We're tired of subpar working conditions. We feel alone in our insecurities. We wonder if we're helping our clients. We have a dark sense of humor. We deserve to feel supported and empowered in this field. But we differ from our predecessors, and we need more books to reflect those differences. I see you. I am you. And I believe we need space for the messy and flawed and hopelessly insecure parts that can go along with doing this work. Myth: Successful therapists don't feel insecure. "Your insecurities show you care. Nobody needs you to have all the answers. People need to know you care." Your insecurities show you care.
Almost all therapists doubt themselves. And they should. When we're humble, we're more empathic and understanding, and we don't assume we know all the answers. Instead, we remain open to learning and growing. Myth: Therapists are healthy and well-adjusted professionals. Paradoxically, we are attracted to pain. Likewise, while doing this work, we bring our stories, pains, and fears into each session. And through treating the problems of others, some therapists strategically avoid examining their own. We might be experts in mental health, but our expertise doesn't fix our own problems. Myth: Successful therapists always know what to do with their clients. Successful therapists don't always know what to do. Our clients rock our worlds, and our uncertainties reflect that. We can't always fit the hurt. It is impossible to always know the next move or intervention or phrase. We all struggle with immense doubt. Successful therapists learn to embrace it. Myth: Therapists give advice. Therapists help explore the barriers that lie between knowing and doing.
Our job is to provide support and compassion. We support people in finding their conclusions about how they want to live their lives. We don't force them on to our preferred paths. Myth: Therapists don't make any real money. Myth: One credential is better than another credential. There probably is a best credential for you. Different credentials offer different levels of focus and expertise. Myth: Most clients are ready to change. Most clients want to change other people. They also want to change their circumstances. They want to wake up into their perfect lives, but not if achieving such perfection requires work. Clients do want to change. But many obstacles make that change incredibly challenging. Myth: Therapists make great partners, parents, and friends. Even when I try to model healthy communication or vulnerability, it doesn't mean others react positively. Therapists are humans. We get upset and flustered; we act irrationally, and we don't always think clearly. And because we give so much to our clients all day, we often have little to give to the rest of the world. Myth: Therapy must be face-to-face to be effective. American physicians performed lobotomies until 1967. Until 2010, American insurance companies could deny people healthcare coverage based on preexisting mental illness. We don't always know what we don't know. We only grow and get better with time. Therapy will evolve, and face-to-face therapy isn't the only answer. We must be open to new ways of helping. We may not agree with such changes, but we must promote diversity and flexibility in this profession. If we don't adapt, the career we love will die. Identify the Type of Insecure Therapist You Are: The Insecure Person: This therapist often: Struggles with an anxiety disorder.
Requires ongoing reassurance and validation for their skills.
Questions their abilities while in session constantly.
Fantasizes about switching careers.
Feels untethered in their sessions (they obsessively study new interventions or read new books or sign up for new training courses with the hopes of building more confidence). The Perfectionist: This therapist often: Believes they will fail at anything they try. Avoids taking risks or trying new things due to unwavering fear of failure. Wants to quantify abstract problems or solutions. Obsesses over policies, procedures and rules. Puts too much on their plate and typically overworks. Feels frustrated when clients don't succeed in predictable patterns. The Unresolved Life Shit Therapist: This therapist often: Struggles with remaining objective in sessions. Experiences intense and possibly uncontrollable countertransference. Stresses over their own mental health. Feels unable to maintain consistent and healthy boundaries with clients. The Straight-Up People Pleaser: This therapist often: Struggles or avoids confrontation with clients. Feels terrified and upset by aggressive clients. Dreads all forms of feedback. Feels paralyzed when faced with any semblance of conflict. Tiptoes around delicate issues in sessions or the workplace. Can You Be All of the Above?: You are just a human, and you have weaknesses. Now you're more aware of what they are and how they impact your work and your clients. So, how do you actually deal?
Get Your Own Therapy. Therapy has never been an exact science. The heart of what we do entails an abstract human element. We can have all the knowledge and skills, but we can't remove the human parts of our work. Behind every successful therapist is another therapist supporting them. Therapy makes us better therapists, and it also makes us better people. Therapy allows us to explore both our personal and professional lives in one space. It offers a valuable opportunity for growth, self-awareness, and healing. We cannot fully support our clients without thoughtful insight into our own lives. Furthermore, how can we expect people to be honest and vulnerable with us if we never sit on the couch ourselves? But What If I've Already Tried Therapy, and It Didn't Work? Even when they know it's important, many therapists love to resist personal therapy, Usually, we fear exposing our vulnerabilities. Sharing weakness with another professional might reinforce our sense of incompetence. "How do I find a therapist as a therapist?" If you want the easy answer, I don't have it. There is no easy answer. Our profession does not make us inherently unique as people, it just makes us privy to how psychotherapy works. Learn to Accept Distraction: Ironic Process Theory: When we try to suppress a though, another part of our brain checks in to ensure we're not thinking about it. Yet, this brain activity triggers us to think about it more. Intrusive thoughts happen all the time. Distraction is inevitable. It is how we deal with it that matters. Learn How to Move Back to the Present Moment: Accept the thoughts instead of resisting them. Pretend someone else is watching you. Make it a personal mission to move away from your boredom. Four pathways to reignite your interest: Acknowledge our distraction to the client. When we admit to our own shortcomings, we model being human to our clients. Pivot the conversation. Address our emotions. Pretend you are your client. You don't need to master working with one population right away (or ever). Keep an open mind during your training years. Get exposure. Learn new ways of doing things. Many therapists stumble into a population or theory without seeking it out. Stay curious about what you don't know. Learn to accept unconventional and nonlinear progress. Before we even attempt to measure progress, we must identify the obstacles that make measurements challenging. Here are some considerations: Obstacle 1: Clients lie (Both intentionally and unintentionally) ‚ÄúOur clients lie to us for many reasons. First, they want us to like them. Many clients fantasize about being our favorite client. They present well because they want us to feel proud and impressed by them. Often, they‚Äôve had countless experiences related to feeling like they‚Äôve let other people down. Their efforts to please emerge from the transference they experience toward us.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, clients lie because they know our positions of authority and power, particularly when it comes to mandated reporting. They avoid disclosing sensitive material related to issues like suicidal thoughts or child abuse. They worry the truth will get them into trouble.‚Äù
‚ÄúClients also lie because they want to test us. Sometimes, they want to determine what we remember and what we forget. Are we really a safe person? Are we truly trustworthy? Can we actually hold the pain we promise we can hold? Most lies come from a place of hopeful truth.‚Äù
The very best lies often sound like the very best truths. Obstacle 2: Trust can take a very long time. We can't just turn on trust like it's a light switch. We have to foster it in every interaction we have with our clients. Obstacle 3: Progress in One Area Can Reveal Flaws Somewhere Else. Improvements in one concentrated area can have the effect of improvement in other areas. For new therapists, this reality may feel discouraging, and that's because it can be. After all, many clients come to us desperately wanting to change in their lives. Obstacle 4: The Client's Goal Isn't Always the Best Goal. Therapists working with acute, high-risk populations (substance use disorders, eating disorders, complex trauma, psychotic disorders) see this discrepancy all the time. They know about denial and minimization and intellectualization. As therapists, it's important that we recognize the hierarchy of treatment needs. Identifying and treating certain issues must precede others. However, a mismatch in priorities can certainly impact progress, and it can also create issues within the therapeutic relationship itself. After all, we aren't supposed to have an agenda. We are, however, supposed to keep our clients safe. At times, these issues can and will intersect. Obstacle 5: We Rarely Receive Productive Feedback. Nobody sees us in the therapy room. Our colleagues, supervisors, or spouses can't watch us perform. Although we discuss cases, we don't receive accurate feedback about our skills, because nobody truly knows what we're saying or doing. This lack of feedback makes measuring progress difficult. Most clients won't provide us with direct feedback. We are not allowed to solicit testimonials. This dynamic leaves us in a vulnerable position. We rely on clients to be honest about their feelings towards us. At the same time, we must straddle the reality of knowing that most clients avoid confrontation, want to please us, and blame themselves if and when things go wrong in therapy. Obstacle 6: Things Get Worse Before They Get Better. Therapists struggle when they watch their clients struggle. First, we care about their well-being. Additionally, we often assume that a happy client indicates that we are doing our job successfully. But we can't just measure progress by a client's level of happiness. In fact, happiness isn't always measurable or achievable. Sometimes, we must measure progress based on other factors like increased self-awareness or strengthening boundaries or changing negative behaviors. We must remember that our clients may remain in the 'getting worse' phase even after they leave treatment. This phenomenon is common when we don't control the termination. Remember that books don't always tell the truth. Because even when therapists try to educate their readers and showcase their weaknesses, they inevitably brag about their brilliance. All successful writing needs to be engaging, compelling, and crafted to appeal to a target demographic. Talented writers may know how to write about therapy more than they know how to conduct therapy. Just be mindful that even master therapists aren't perfect all the time. A good writer isn't always a good therapist. Understand that you'll never be the right age. We will never be the 'perfect age' to be therapists. No matter our ages, some clients will benefit from it, and others will have a problem with it. We invariably hold biases about age, but we hold biases about everything. Our clients make automatic assumptions based on every detail we provide them. And since we don't offer our clients much, they base their judgements on whatever is accessible. Regardless of the accuracy, the assumptions connect dots and illustrate a picture of who we are. Clients don't want us to be blank templates. They want to know we are human, and they will latch on to any shred of human evidence they can find from us. My best advice is to lean into this narrative. Your age is yours. While it doesn't define you, it is a fixed part of you. Don't forget that you are going to die. I recommend you imagine yoruself on your deathbed. Scan through all the past and current events, people, and places in your life. Don't spend too long in the space. Then visualize yourself drifting into death, settling into the depths of the darkest night. It's about reminding ourselves that life is incredibly short and precious. We don't need to have 'perfect therapist' etched on our headstones. We are going to die, and life is so much more than the sum of our careers. We are all going to die. But before we do that, we need to learn how to live. Know the limits of graduate school. Graduate school teaches the foundational principles of psychotherapy. We learn the laws and ethics, and we receive bite-size samples of theory, interventions, and psychoeducation. But until we do therapy, we really have no way of knowing what therapy feels like. School teaches us the logic of the work, but only experience teaches us the emotion of it. Understand your relationships can, will, and should evolve. In becoming therapists, we learn about the nitty-gritty patterns of human behavior. Simultaneously, by understanding these patterns, we engage in a deep and rigorous self-analysis. We have no choice but to also look inward, to examine how we operate in the world. And while this soul-searching offers tantalizing insight, all self-awareness has the potential to be painful. However, if you value emotional wellness and personal growth, the pain is a necessary part of the process. Cultivate a connection with a professor or supervisor. Professors and supervisors also hold power. They can dramatically affect your sucess in terms of internships, scholarships, or long-term career options. We all benefit from having someone who can vouch for us. Ideally, this person will: Write an excellent letter of recommendation if needed. Act as a reference when applying for internships or jobs. Provide appropriate and helpful guidance. If you are a new therapist, start thinking about this goal immediately. Make yourself memorable. Ask questions. Attend office hours. Be active and engaged in conversation, and show up ready to work and learn. Master time management. Audit how you spend every working hour for one week. Make red, yellow, and green to do lists. The reds are the most imminent and nonnegotiable tasks. They have to get done, so I prioritize them first. Yellows are important, but they are less time-sensitive and critical than the reds. I move to yellows only after I complete the red tasks. I reserve greens for last. Some days, I get to them. Most days, I don't. Ban distractions. We crave distraction. Although most of us complain about our procrastination habits, we forget that procrastination is also fun. The best way for me to ban distractions is by prohibiting them during my red tasks. I also build in ten-minute breaks every thirty minutes. This permits me to work in longer chunks without completely draining my energy. Remember that motivation is optional, but discipline is necessary. Motivation is fickle because it's a feeling. Feelings, as we know, are fleeting. Discipline, on the other hand, is an action. We can discipline ourselves regardless of our feelings. Many people who struggle with discipline also struggle with poor time management. That's because they wait to feel motivated to discipline themselves. Stop waiting. Start doing. Take care of your finances. Financial insecurity impacts our personal lives. But it also creates an insidious ripple effect in our professional endeavors.
Your financial health is part of your well-being, and today's stressors can become tomorrow's emergencies. If you're neglecting this part of your life, take the time to identify small changes you can make today. Focus on being a growth-oriented therapist. Training therapists should recognize they are learning, and that they don't need to know everything. They need to work hard, but they're allowed to have limitations. The goal is not having all the experience or knowledge. The goal is to have ongoing movement toward growth. This is a value that can and should continue throughout one's professional career. Growth-Oriented Therapists: Ask difficult questions to clients (even if they feel uncomfortable and provocative).
Presents mistakes, weaknesses, and concerns to their supervisor, with the intention to learn from them. They are active in supervision, and they offer practical suggestions and feedback to their colleagues. Focus on client growth instead of client approval. They address pain and confront clients when appropriate. Walk into the session with a sense of purpose and the mindset of practicing their skills. They feel a sense of control over the session. Use conceptualization skills to interpret the client's overall presentation. They consider what is being said, but they also consider what might be omitted. Understand the overall fluidity of therapy. They recognize that growth occurs mostly outside of sessions and that therapy is the catalyst for change (and not the change itself).
Have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. They feel motivated to work on weaknesses and readily accept feedback in doing so. Understand that therapy often has unknown outcomes. They conceptualize how clients might react, but they aren't tethered to this expectation. Stagnant Therapists: Maintain surface-level conversation and often play it safe in dialogue with clients.
Sugarcoat or downplay issues in sessions. They tend to focus only on what is going well. They share minimally in supervision, as they don't want to be judged by their supervisor or colleagues. Struggle to accept hardships within the therapeutic relationship. They often hold back in confronting clients. Walk into the session feeling scattered. They're at the mercy of whatever the client brings that day, and they often lose focus. Lack conceptualization skills. They take client content and disclosures at face value, and they become distracted or overwhelmed by content details presented in session. View sessions as separate entities. They judge sessions as 'good' or 'bad' based on variables like if a client made a significant breakthrough or responded well to a particular intervention. May have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. But, they feel paralyzed or doomed by their weaknesses and may become defensive over them.
Want controllable outcomes. They either avoid conceptualization altogether or they expect themselves to know what exactly what to do. Your training status isn't a secret. If you are a trainee, intern, or associate, you have already disclosed your status to clients. You are under supervision, and you work under someone else's license. Subsequently, nobody expects you to be an expert. But too many therapists fear making mistakes. I understand it is challenging to discern which risks are appropriate to take. Nobody wants to cause irreversible harm to their clients. But that's why we have supervision and training. That's why we work under someone else. This is your time to experiment and grow - you'll never have such ample opportunity again. Remember, your career is more than a calling. We must remember that we are healthcare professionals and trained experts in treating mental illness. We spend significant money and time to cultivate our craft. At times, we save lives. Our work matters. Let's rise to that. Accept all the anxieties. With time and experience, we gain confidence in ourselves and in our skills. Although the anxiety often feels paralyzing at first, you must trust that it eventually subsides. I found comfort knowing everyone else felt equally terrified. Accept that those negative thoughts will arise. Accept that they don't indicate your truth. As therapists, we help people move through their fears in almost every session. It only makes sense that we learn this skill ourselves. Practive letting go of controlling the room. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/sometimes-therapy-is-awkward-nicole-arzt.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Pre-Practicum (8189.11)/Readings/Sometimes Therapy Is Awkward - Nicole Arzt.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicole Arzt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 03:42:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@brownBowenFamilySystems2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This paper overviews Bowen family systems theory and its approach to family therapy. It aims to introduce this influential approach and a sample of developments in theory and practice since Bowen's first publications of his research and theory. This paper is the second edition of a 1999 article with the same title (Brown, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy, 20, 94 and 1999) and, 25‚Äâyears later, offers new insights from the original author's ongoing research into the theory. This new edition is in collaboration with a second author and Bowen theory scholar, bringing fresh perspectives on the theory's applicability to family therapy practice. The core concepts are presented briefly, and a case example with a parent and symptomatic adolescent demonstrates how theory informs the role of the therapist and the therapeutic work. Examples of criticisms of Bowen theory are also discussed, including the misinterpretation around the idea of emotion in Bowen theory that is communicated in Gottman's training. Differentiation of self is clarified as the integration of emotion and intellect rather than privileging one over another, which affords the opportunity for individuals to avoid being governed by the invisible strings of sensitivities in relationships and instead be themselves in good emotional contact with the other person.

The eight concepts of theory shape clinical work that tracks emotional processes in relationships and creates the opportunity for recovery and growth. Important criticisms of the theory about culture and gender relevance, the dangers of neutralizing family violence and the use of emotion in therapy are discussed. Seeing the theory applied to a case with symptoms in a child reveals the centrality of observing emotional processes. <br><a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> 's <a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a>, or 'Bowen Theory,' was one of the first comprehensive theories that described how family systems functioned. The approach 'continues to have sustained influence in the practice of family therapy in North America with several training centers that have defied the trend of closing down family systems training centers following the fields' 1970s - 80s heydey.' Many influential family therapists have elements of Bowen theory at the heart of their conceptualization. The more Bowen theory is studied and applied in practice, the more understanding and appreciation of it is refined. <br><a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> was born in 1913 in Tennessee and died in 1990. He trained as a psychiatrist and originally practiced within the psychoanalytical model. At the Menninger Clinic in the late 1940 s, he had started to involve mothers in the investigation and treatment of schizophrenic patients. His devotion to his psychoanalytic training was set aside by the time he moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1954. He was committed to psychiatry becoming an accepted science and found fodder for this in natural systems and evolution. His groundbreaking research with NIMG enabled him and his research team to observe whole families in a residential treatment setting, where he began to include more family members in his research and psychotherapy with schizophrenic patients. This consolidated the shift from an individual and mother-child dyad focus to an appreciation of the dimensions of families as emotional systems. In 1959, he moved to Georgetown University and established the Georgetown Family Center (where he was director until his death). Here, his developing theory was extended to less severe emotional problems. Between 1959 and 1962, he undertook detailed research into families across several generations. Rather than developing a theory about pathology, Bowen focused on what he saw as the common patterns of all 'human emotional systems.' With such a focus on the qualitative similarities of all families, Bowen was known to say frequently, "There is a little schizophrenia in all of us." In 1966, Bowen published the first 'orderly presentation' of his developing ideas. In 1967, he surprised a national family therapy conference by discussing his family experience rather than presenting the anticipated formal paper. Bowen proceeded to encourage students to work on researching facts from their own multigenerational families of origin rather than undertaking individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy (a prominent training method of that time). The effort in one's own family is to better understand the individual self in the context of previous generational challenges, adaptations, and variations in family members' functioning. The interest in evolutionary process distinguishes Bowen from other family therapy pioneers. He placed his earlier study of Freudian theory with 'a study of the rich body of facts that can be proven and validated' in evolution and the natural sciences. Bowen writes: "I support the view that the human is as scientific as the other forms of life on the planet, that it will finally be possible to construct a total human theory from scientific facts alone." (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 360) Bowen was committed to his research and theory being embedded in science with the aim of developing a theory that accounted for the entire range of human behavior and its origins. Bowen focused on mechanisms/patterns that develop in families to adapt to challenges and defuse anxiety. Anxiety is presented as either acute, in that it is a response to an actual adverse event, or chronic, in that the stress response is sustained beyond factual threats.
A key generator of anxiety in families is the alertness to either too much closeness (togetherness force) or too great a distance (separateness force) in a relationship. "The theory postulates two opposing elemental life forces. One is built-in life growth force toward individuality and the differentiation of a separate 'self,' and the other an equally intense emotional closeness." While essential for human family survival, both forces are the source of tensions in relationships with family members, always shifting their pull for more connection or increased space and autonomy. <br>The degree of tension in any one family will be determined by the current levels of external stress and the sensitivities to particular themes transmitted down the generations and heightened or lowered levels of sensitivity related to levels of family emotional maturity or the degree of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>. If family members do not have the capacity to think through their responses to relationship dilemmas but instead continue to react anxiously to perceived emotional demands, a state of chronic anxiety or sustained reactivity may be set in place. Bowen defined eight interlocking concepts that make up his theory: <br><a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>

It is twofold in that it has an intrapsychic expressing in integrating both thinking and feelings and an interpersonal component of maintaining a separate self while connected to a relationship. Viewed as a continuum from low to high Bowen articulates that, "A person with a high level of 'differentiation of self,' or 'identity,' or 'individuality,' is one who can be emotionally close to others without emotional fusions or loss of self, or loss of identity." (Bowen, 1978, p. 109)
In the same way that differentiation has both an intrapsychic and interpersonal component, fusion can be expressed either as a merging of feelings and thinking for an individual or a relational intense sensitivity to another's reactions, which leads to people giving up on their own ideas or values for the sake of the relationship going smoothly. Varying degrees of fusion are discernible in all families. A person in a fused relationship reacts immediately (as if with a reflex, knee-jerk response) to the perceived demands of another person without being able to think through the choices or talk over relationship matters directly with the other person. Energy is invested in taking things personally (ensuring the emotional comfort of another) or in distancing oneself (ensuring one's own). The greater a family's tendency to fuse, the less flexibility it will have in adapting to stress. Bowen developed the idea of a hypothetical 'differentiation of self scale' to assist in conveying the continuum aspect of this concept. He points out that this was not designed as an instrument to assign people to particular levels. Bowen maintains that the speculative nature of estimating a level of differentiation is compounded by factors usch as stress levels, individual differences in reactivity to different stressors and the degree of contact individuals have with their extended family. Bowen acknowledged that an effort to increase differentiation is a lifelong process. The goal is to observe the self on the spectrum to enhance awareness and improve functioning in small steps. One example of gradual steps is the effort to establish a more neutral personal relationship with each parent. "Achieving a person-to-person relationship with either parent is a major undertaking, but, if the differentiating person is aware that the result is highly desireable and of great potential benefit to self, [they have] a long-term assignment at which they can work constantly in their own way." (Bowen, 1978, p. 236) The scale of differentiation conveys that the theory is about a continuum of levels of functioning and not a theory that categorizes or pathologizes people. The goal is to observe self on this spectrum and increase functioning just a bit, leading to a similar lift in the functioning of the whole family. Bowen described triangles as the smallest stable relationship unit (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 135) because it is difficult to contain the emotional forces in a two-person relationship. Triangling is said to occur when the inevitable discomfort in a dyad is relieved by involving a third party who either takes sides or provides a detour for anxiety. Under calm conditions, it is difficult to identify triangles, but like all mechanisms to manage anxiety, they emerge more frequently and more intensely under stress. Triangles are linked closely with Bowen's concept of differentiation in that the greater the degree of fusion in a relationship, the more heightened the pull to preserve emotional stability by forming a triangle. The process of conflict, distance and over- and underfunctioning also feature as part of the Triangling patterns in relationships. This process is not dysfunction but can become problematic when a third party's involvement distracts the members of a dyad from resolving their relationship impasse. If a third party is drawn in, the focus shifts to criticizing or worrying about the new outsider, preventing the original complainants from resolving their tension. This detouring helps people steady themselves without working on growing their maturity. In positing the 'nuclear family emotional system,' Bowen 'describes the patterns of emotional functioning in a family in a single generation' (Bowen 1978, p. 376) Observable patterns in families for managing the anxieties inherent in a family's undifferentiation. These patterns are repeated over the generations: Certain basic patterns between the father, mother, and children are replicas of the past generations and will be repeated in the generations to follow. (Bowen, 1978, p. 376) Fusion that both preserves harmony and generates tension is present in varying degrees in all families, who will predictably utilize the following patterns to manage levels of discomfort. These tension management mechanisms are: Couple conflict and distance
Distance
Symptoms/illness in a spouse (over and underfunctioning reciprocity)
Projection of a problem onto one or more children The single-generation unit usually starts with a dyad - a couple who, according to Bowen, will be at approximately equal levels of differentiation (i.e., both have the same degree of need to be stabilized and validated through the relationship).
Permission to disagree is one of the most important contracts between individuals in an intimate relationship. In a fused relationship, partners interpret the emotional state of the other as their responsibility and the other; s stated disagreement as a personal affront to them. Conflict only becomes problematic when it is chronically sustained by emotional reactivity. (this is what we see in the clinic with couples who have been together for years and are coming in for couples therapy) A typical pattern in emotionally intense relationships is a cycle of closeness followed by conflict to create distance, which in turn is followed by the couple making up and resuming the intense closeness. This pattern is termed a 'conflictual cocoon,' (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 192) where anxiety is bound within the conflict cycle without spilling over to involve children. Distancing is not just inherent in patterns of marital conflict but a broader way of avoiding emotional tension that is part of triangling a child and over- and underfunctioning of spouses. It is one of the most instinctive ways humans reduce discomfort in a relationship by withdrawing emotionally or physically. Kerr describes, "An example of emotional distancing is people being in physical proximity but avoiding emotionally charged topics. The anxiety is bound in the avoiding of such topics." In a fused relationship, where each partner looks to the other's qualities to fit their own learned manner of relating to significant others, a pattern of reciprocity can be set in motion that pushes each spouse's functioning to opposite extremes. Both are equally undifferentiated in that they define themselves according to the reactions of the other. The spouse who makes the most adjustments in the self in order to preserve relationship harmony is said by Bowen to be prone to developing symptoms. "The one who functions for long periods in the adaptive [underfunctioning] position gradually loses the ability to function and make decisions for self. At that point, it requires no more than a moderate increase in stress to trigger the adaptive one into dysfunction." (Bowen, 1978, p. 378) ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/references/@brownbowenfamilysystems2024.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/References/@brownBowenFamilySystems2024.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:19:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[References]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/references/references.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/References/References.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 13:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family System Theory]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/family-system-theory/family-system-theory.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/Family System Theory/Family System Theory.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 13:45:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@bermanRiskAssessmentTreatment2006]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bibliography: Berman, A.

Title: Risk Assessment, Treatment Planning, and Management of the At-Risk-for-Suicide Client
Year: 2006

itemType: document
Publisher: Suicide Research Prevention CenterAbstract: The potential for a marriage and family therapist (MFT) to be confronted by a suicidal client or the potential for suicide in their caseload is significant, yet few MFTs have been adequately trained in the assessment and management of suicidal risk For that matter, so have few psychiatrists, psychologists, or other mental health professionals.
All too often, it is after the fact of a suicide of a client that the MFT is confronted with recognizing this gap in their training. Clinical Competencies: Working with Individuals At-Risk for Suicide: Attitudes and Approach: No treatment will be successful without the establishment of a good therapeutic alliance with the client. At-risk for suicide clients are often interpersonally dysfunctional and/or have significant pathology that makes difficult creating a strong working relationship. Patients who went on to commit suicide within two years of being hospitalized, compared to others still alive, were those most often described at their intake session as guarded, hostile, difficult to interview. Approaches and Attitudes in Creating Therapeutic Alliance: Being aware of how at-risk patients affect us, and effectively managing our reactions. It is up to the therapist to maintain a collaborative, non-adversarial stance in creating a safe harbor for these clients to share information essential for understanding their level of risk, and to develop a treatment plan that will reduce that risk. This work requires an active role for the therapist truly invested in understanding the client. It requires the therapist to be available, accessible, and willing to foster a dependency to strengthen the initial attachment. To effectively move ahead, the therapist and client need to develop a shared perspective and work as a team toward decreased risk. Understanding Suicide: The therapist needs to be able to accurately characterize suicidal and self-destructive behaviors to reasonably understand concepts of intent and lethality. Intent refers to the aims, purposes, or goals of the behavior - death (ending all further experience of pain by never more being conscious), a wish for rebirth, or to join a loved one in heaven, are commonly expressed statements that describe suicidal intent. Understanding the data of suicide and what characterizes chronic and acute risk ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/ethics-(7770)/readings/4.-breaking-confidentiality/@bermanriskassessmenttreatment2006.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Ethics (7770)/Readings/4.

In couple‚Äôs therapy, secrets between the couple often arise, and couple‚Äôs therapists must navigate a balance between their ethical and therapeutic responsibilities. This paper provides a scoping review of the literature on how couple‚Äôs therapists handle secrets in the context of couple‚Äôs therapy and discusses the ethical and clinical considerations in the context of the ethical standards of the AAMFT. Online databases were used to systematically identify peer-reviewed academic, English-language articles that focused on recommendations for therapists in handling secrets between couples in therapy. Seven articles met the search criteria. The empirical evidence supports a model of professional judgment, whereby the therapist can use their discretion about whether or not to disclose a secret on behalf of a client. To operate within the confines of ethical practice, we recommend therapists pair professional judgment with a clearly informed and signed written client policy.

Promotes healing and attachment, but final decision about disclosure should be left to offending spouse. Voluntary consent should be obtained at the outset of therapy to avoid jeopardizing trust and to remain an equal advocate for both partners. Possible exceptions to disclosure: Serious or terminal illness of injured spouse; imminent divorce; potential for violence; significant psychopathology in either partner; many years have passed, and issue is unrelated facilitated disclosure; it is ethical for therapists to collude in keeping secrets. Honesty is vital to recovery. After disclosure most couples choose the challenges of healing over divorce. Disclosure of infidelity is best course of action to resolve potential conflicts and improve working alliance toward couple healing and renewal. Through voluntary facilitated disclosure (based on the desires of aggrieved spouse) or referral, therapists should avoid double-bind of doing therapy in cases of non-disclosed secrets. The choice to disclose is subjective - one person may readily disclose what another might choose to conceal. <br>

<a data-href="Secrets in CFT" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/secrets-in-cft.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Secrets in CFT</a>: Responsible handling of secrets between partners in couple's therapy is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems arising from the revelation, particularly due to the sensitive nature of secrets. Therapeutically, a secret has the potential to undermine the development of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the secret-disclosing partner if the secret is shared with the other member of the couple. Non-disclosure may also undermine the maintenance of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the other partner, who may perceive the therapist as triangulating with the secret holder, if the secret is not shared but arises later in the course of therapy. Additionally, there are potential ethical and legal problems that may emerge due to breaking the confidentiality of an individual through sharing a secret. <br>

But can result in harm if the therapist, wittingly or unwittingly, colludes with one member of the couple. The conjoint process provides an opening for a couple to grow and learn from one another that is often lost in traditional individual approaches. The therapist may not reveal any individual‚Äôs confidences to others in the client unit without the prior written permission of that individual. Many therapists work within this framework by having a policy around secrets explicitly stated in their consent form signed by clients at the beginning of therapy.

Highlight
Revealing client motivations for disclosure is important, as revealing secrets may not always have relationally sensitive intentions

Future research should examine the ethical considerations and client impact of disclosure of a secret that is not relationally motivated

The content of the secret may also have an impact on disclosure and requires professional judgment
-
Highlight
Future research would benefit from exploring content of secrets as another variable that may impact the outcomes of disclosure to provide some guidance to professional judgment.
-
Highlight
Future research should also assess the role of sociocultural identities within the couple as it relates to secrets. The quality of the therapeutic alliance may also have an impact on the decision to reveal a secret to the therapist and/or to the partner within the context of therapy. Additionally, self of therapist issues may arise in the context of secrets in couple‚Äôs therapy

Highlight
Further research is needed to understand the role of therapeutic alliance and self of therapist issues in the context of secrets within couple‚Äôs therapy

future research examines the client perspective, the impact of different policies on therapeutic outcomes from the therapist and client perspective, and the ethical implications of each option
-
Highlight
We recommend that therapists‚Äô pair professional judgment with a written policy that both clients within a couple are clearly informed of and sign in order to operate within the confines of ethical practice.
-
Highlight
the empirical evidence to guide clinicians on their policies is scarce

Highlight
we recommend future research examines the impact of these policies on couples themselves, their willingness to dedicate time to therapy, and the impact of different policies regarding secrets on therapeutic outcomes.

This paper is intended to help therapists recognize family secrets, to clarify the theoretical and relational contexts in which they are embedded, and to suggest guidelines and approaches for their therapeutic management. A related aim is to raise and address some of the ethical issues that are inseparable from a consideration of family secrets. Secrets involve information that is either withheld or differentially shared between or among people.
Secrets tend, for the most part, not to be about feelings or thoughts, but about facts, real happenings or incidents. Importance of what Boszormenyi-Nagy and his coworkers have described as the ethical-existential dimension of human life in close relationships. This dimension concerns the facts of a person's life and their impact on him/her and those in relationship with him/her, as well as the actions of each person toward one another, especially as they affect mutual debts, entitlements, and trustworthiness. The network of persons involved in the secret as the awareness context. Refers to the network as a whole and includes those who are unaware of the secret as well as those who know it. A fairly simple typology of secrets can be drawn from the kinds of boundaries created in the relational system. From this perspective, three major types of family secrets emerge: (a) individual secrets; (b) internal family secrets; and (c) shared family secrets. Individual secrets involve those cases in which one person keeps a secret from the other person or persons in the family. In both cases, one person's secret is shared with no one else in the family. The boundary formed by the secret is located between the person holding the secret and the other(s). Internal family secrets involve those cases in which at least two people keep a secret from at least one other. Internal family secrets create sub-groupings within the family. Shared family secrets involve those cases in which all members of the family know the secret but are pledged to keep it from persons outside the family. Shared family secrets strengthen the boundaries separating the family as a whole from the outside world. The person or persons who know and keep the secret can be referred to as the secret-holder(s) and the person who does not know the secret as the unaware.
The subject, meaning the person that the secret is about. Subject and secret-holder may be one and the same person, or they may be different.
The confusion that surrounds secrets may make it difficult in some cases to make absolute distinctions between knowing and not knowing a secret.
For some secret-holders, there may be absolute clarity about the fact that there is a secret, but others may be quite surprised to recognize the secret as such.
There is a need for a way to identify secrets, even when the secret-holder is unaware of them as such.
The therapist should immediately consider the possible existence of secrets any time the word "know" needs to be used more than once in a sentence either by the patient or the therapist. It is nearly impossible to overemphasize the significance of loyalty dynamics in the creation, maintenance, and eventual facing of secrets in families. Often, the secret-holder feels, or may actually be, "sworn to silence." S/he owes it to the other person(s) to keep the secret. Disclosing the secret would be experienced as an act of betrayal and would arouse guilt over disloyalty. These cases concern dynamics of loyalty to the secret-holder(s). But the awareness context is further complicated by the fact that a secret-holder may also feel loyalty to the unaware.
Highlight -
Highlight
Boszormenyi-Nagy has described as a "split-loyalty pattern"
-
Highlight
loyalty dynamics can contribute to the creation and maintenance of family secrets that, in turn, are likely to generate or exacerbate split-loyalty patterns.
-
Highlight
In some cases of secrets, there is an element of "one-upsmanship;"; the secret-holder feels "one-up" on the unaware.
-
Highlight
The power dynamics implied here exist in more subtle and often much more destructive forms in nominally more mature relationships; the secret-holder gloats in his/her secret knowledge and the other's ignorance.
-
Highlight
the secret-holder has the threat of "un-used ammunition."
-
Highlight
There is a dangerous and unstable tension inherent in these power dynamics of secrets because, in order to be able to savor the full effect of the secret, to squeeze every ounce of cruelty from it, the secret-holder must reveal it. Then s/he can see the reaction of the other person when s/he realizes s/he has been deceived. There is, therefore, an inherent instability in such patterns, always pressing toward destructive disclosures.
-
Highlight
Internal family secrets create or strengthen boundaries and alliances within the family between secret-holders. Estrangements develop between secret-holders and the unaware in response to the secret-holder's inability or unwillingness to discuss the secret and to the deception or mystification that often follows in the wake of secrets.
-
Highlight
A curious fact about secrets is that the boundaries created by them depend not only upon who knows the secret but knowing who knows.
-
Highlight
the boundary created between the two sons is just as real as that created between the secret-holder and the unaware, even though both know the secret.
-
Highlight
When all members know the secret and, unlike the case above, know they all know, the secret serves to strengthen the boundary between the family and the outside world. In extreme cases, it may make alliances between family members and persons outside the family virtually impossible if they feel they can neither reveal the secret nor become involved emotionally without revealing the secret.

Maintaining confidentiality in family and couple‚Äôs therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties; there are multiple avenues for problems to arise, and it is imperative for therapists to be able to decide when they should keep secrets and when they‚Äôre justified in breaching confidentiality. To add to this dilemma, therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients. As such, the purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists‚Äô understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients‚Äô perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Upon research, it became apparent that there is a dearth of information exploring clients‚Äô perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Furthermore, there is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client‚Äôs willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists‚Äô decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients. Thus, this literature review presents the need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones‚Äô culture can influence their beliefs.Purpose:

The purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists‚Äô understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients‚Äô perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.
The present study seeks to address this issue by considering the role of culture on the therapist‚Äôs decision to disclose as well as differences related to culture around clients‚Äô feelings and expectations for privacy in therapy Introduction: Confidentiality in MFT can be complicated due to the various parties involved. (AAMFT) recommend that policies concerning confidentiality be discussed at the beginning of therapy during the informed consent process.
A therapist is not allowed to reveal any individual‚Äôs confidence in the system-oriented therapy setting without the prior written permission of that individual. Gottlieb (1996) described four conceptually distinct variations of confidentiality that could be used with couples or families: 1) treat information disclosed individually as confidential; 2) inform each client that no information is confidential; 3) allow certain information to remain confidential as a matter of personal privacy; or 4) agree to allow certain information to be temporarily kept confidential, with the stipulation that it must be disclosed at a later time.
May have very serious implications depending on the client (or family/couple) scenario.
in cases of couple and family treatment, the therapist should outline the rules of treatment, defining who the patients are, as well as confidentiality and any limitations.
There are no legal or professional ethics that directly address the issue of cultural mismatch.
Maintaining confidentiality in family and couple‚Äôs therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties.
Therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients.
There is a dearth of information exploring clients‚Äô perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.
There is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client‚Äôs willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists‚Äô decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients.
Need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones‚Äô culture can influence their beliefs.
One of the issues faced by therapists relates to whether or not secrets should be kept.
Relational therapists‚Äô supported facilitated disclosure of infidelity, so long as it was in an informed and voluntary manner.
The therapists felt that healing and attachment security were optimally achieved through disclosure.
Findings revealed that therapists spent a great deal of time deciding how to handle secrets, used a ‚Äúprofessional judgment‚Äù approach, and informed clients verbally of their confidentiality policy. Results also revealed that 25% of the sample noted that a couple was unhappy or expressed concern over the manner in which a secret was handled and that the approach used to deal with the secret was not predictive of the number of complaints lodged.
dilemma faced by marriage and family therapists when a child discloses information that a counselor is mandated to report
suggest relying on sound professional judgment when deciding whether or not it is appropriate to breech confidentiality and suggest reviewing confidentiality and the limitations associated with it on an ongoing basis.
Ethical issues surrounding disclosures by minor children in marriage and family therapy is grossly understudied.
Marriage and family therapists be aware of their state‚Äôs laws prior to breeching confidentiality.
In the event that a client is participating in illegal activity, the counselor should encourage the client to turn him or herself in to the proper authorities.
Should a counselor choose to report a client‚Äôs illegal activity, the authors argue that he or she should refer the client to another therapist because the counselor has now become the accuser.
Findings revealed differences in the ways of obtaining informed consent, approach to discussing confidentiality, information shared with parents or guardians, and the influence of client-specific factors on the management of confidentiality.
Two factors play a large role in the therapist‚Äôs decision to breech confidentiality: 1) the negative nature of the client‚Äôs behavior, and 2) the desire to maintain the therapeutic process.
A small percentage of respondents were not informing their clients about confidentiality (and its limits) until a problem arose.
The author recommends review and discussion of written confidentiality policies with each client, the need for comprehensive written policies about limits to confidentiality that go beyond legally determined requirements to include collaborative relationships, third- party payers, and supervision, and training on ethical dilemmas related to confidentiality focusing on the areas identified in the study as areas of need including collaborative relationships, legal knowledge, and managed care.
Grounded theory methodology revealed three main concepts: 1) defining who constitutes the therapy client, 2) maintaining privacy and confidentiality during the therapeutic process, and 3) handling private or secret disclosures made during individual breakout sessions.
While some information is disclosed, other information typically considered important to the counseling relationship is not disclosed at the outset of therapy (e.g., limits of confidentiality, treatment risks).
Many rehabilitation counselors do not fully inform their clients about the limits of confidentiality at the outset of counseling.
Participants‚Äô view of privacy differed greatly from Western views and that the privacy protections used in the study created discomfort among participants.
Any definition of privacy must take into account the cultural variations in defining and understanding this concept.
Confidentiality is not a one-size fits all approach, particularly for practitioners working with a very diverse caseload.
More research is needed to directly assess cultural influences on the confidentiality.
Therapists can take steps to ensure that they become more culturally competent.
They note that many Native Americans consider silence to be a sign of respect, and that they value careful listening. Some may even perceive too many questions as being rude or disrespectful, along with taking notes during an interview since it defers from vigilant listening.
Asian American individuals may be less confrontational and yearn for harmonious relationships. They may also view direct eye contact as invasive, and may desire a level of formal respect.
As with Hispanic/Latin American individuals, religion may take prominence over therapy; the Catholic Church is very influential within this group, and often plays a vital role in helping individuals with mental health problems.
Some Hispanic/Latin American individuals may believe that their mental health is out of their control, which may create issues in situations where a therapist needs to aid the individual in establishing a locus of control.
Individuals within cultures are very diverse, and it is unfair to assume that these guidelines will apply to every single person.
It is still imperative for therapists to have knowledge of the possible cultural influences, as this can undeniably affect the client-therapist relationship including, but not limited to, the confidentiality process.
There is a dearth of information exploring clients‚Äô perceptions and understanding of confidentiality and even less that takes into account how cultural components may influence a client‚Äôs willingness to disclose during sessions.
The majority of studies focused on these issues without directly considering cultural influences.
Therapists should be weary of clients‚Äô and their own cultural influences; careful care should be taken to ensure that the client understands the therapists‚Äô confidentiality terms and conditions when confidentiality terms or a secret may not be maintained.
It is recommended that family therapists take into account the context of culture prior therapeutic decisions.
Culture plays a large role in an individual‚Äôs decision-making process in terms of when it is appropriate to breech confidentiality as well as how the breech is perceived.
Values may not always be considered ethical, which may create the possibility that a clinician‚Äôs personal values do not protect the welfare of his or her clients.
A lack of understanding around the limits of confidentiality would limit the amount of information disclosed in sessions.
Examined psychologists knowledge of legal and ethical guidelines and found almost 75% of participants were misinformed about their state laws, despite reporting a belief they were well aware of state statutes and ethical guidelines.
Therapists‚Äô understanding of the confidentiality concept as well as the implications this may have for couples and families, has been grossly understudied.
The influence of culture on the therapy process is an important area of inquiry which has implications for the therapeutic alliance, the type of information disclosed, and treatment effectiveness and outcome. Therapists from different cultures viewed confidentiality policies differently, and 2) clients from different cultural backgrounds reported significant differences in their understanding and comfort level with their rights to confidentiality and its limits. May support the notion that there is passive discrimination occurring in that individuals from non-Western cultures have different perceptions and understanding of the confidentiality process, which may influence their willingness to disclose, and thus, impact the outcome of treatment.
Therapists should be more proactive in assessing clients‚Äô understanding of the confidentiality process.
This lack of clear guidance has resulted in more and more providers deciding to not consult professionals in ethics or the law to resolve their ethical dilemmas; rather they are consulting supervisors and colleague.
Neither the AAMFT code of ethics or New York State Mental Hygiene Law offers guidance regarding how non-Western therapists should proceed if their cultural values or worldview is inconsistent with our Western confidentiality policy.
Reluctance among non-Western clinicians to breech confidentiality under any circumstance
‚ÄúIn practice, the decision to break confidentiality is multi-factored and complex, likely influenced by a combination of the psychologist‚Äôs own values, the items and factors discussed in the present study, and additional considerations that have yet to be discovered"
Confidentiality may not be a one-size-fits-all concept. Results indicate that clients from non-Western cultures did not completely understand the concept of privileged communication or the limits to confidentiality.
Confidentiality policies were limited and argued for their reexamination as they relate to therapy.
For some clients, the concept of confidentiality was inconsistent with their beliefs, thus creating a disconnect between one of the benchmarks of therapy (i.e., confidentiality) and an individual or family‚Äôs culture of origin.
Non-Western therapists expressed reluctance to breech confidentiality under an circumstance
Confidentiality guidelines should be tailored to the particular context and individuals involved in treatment.
Future research may wish to examine the decision- making process as it relates to confidentiality of non-Western therapists more closely with more diverse and larger samples.
It is not the intent of clinicians to conduct ineffective treatment or behave unethically; however, there does seem to be a failure to recognize the role of personal values and culture.
More specific information is needed directly from non-Western clients regarding how to modify the confidentiality process in a way that is respectful, yet still provides the safeguards intended
It is imperative that clinicians find a culturally-respective way to make clients feel safe to reveal what may be embarrassing or personally sensitive information in treatment
More precise comparative study is needed among cultures to better understand the influence of different beliefs.
Ethical therapist behavior clearly requires more than good intentions, and the values permeating therapeutic efforts must‚Ä¶be more than a matter of personal bias and subjectivity
Will inform a decision-making manual which can be easily disseminated to educators and treatment providers. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/ethics-(7770)/readings/3.-confidentiality-in-family-therapy/@mignoneconfidentialityfamilytherapy2017.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Ethics (7770)/Readings/3.

A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. While the 13 th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries. We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community. We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them. What is the presenting problem?

Gender was invisible, implicitly binary, sexist, racist, and White cis-men were the standard. White feminist lens (i.e., White binary, heterosexual perspective, Patriarchy, and sexism) Postmodern approach to gender (still binary and biologically determined) Fmaily therapy theory rests on normative concepts of the traditional family and idealized conceptions of family relationships. Inequalities in the family associated with gender have been regarded as of little importance to the development of macro theory in the field. The two most influential therapeutic models, psychodynamic and systemic approaches, are each marked by gender bias. Feminist therapy is an integrative approach to psychotherapy that focused on the challenges that women face as a result of bias, stereotyping, oppression, discrimination, and other factors, and how those stressors can negatively affect their mental health. 'Feminist Family Therapy is the application of feminist theory and values to family therapy.' Acknowledge and examine the roles of values in therapy for both the therapist and the client (s).
Intentionally introduce a discussion of gender into the therapy process using clinical language and techinques that acknowledge experiences across genders. Assess power inequalities in relationships rather than assuming equity in relationships. Include discussion of individual choice and responsibility in conceptualizations of family dynamics. Honor and appreciate the diversity inherent to families. Consider the clinical implications of interventions on both the family and on individual members of the family. Work actively to reduce power inequalities between therapist and client. (Leslie &amp; Southard 2009) According to intersectional feminists, there is not enough emphasis on the intersection of patriarchy with other factors, such as race, religion, and class. Intersectional feminists argue that other types of feminism assume that all women are exploited in the same way in the family. Self of the therapist

Recognize the family as a key protective factor in mental health outcomes of TGNDB children and work with the whole system. Use the pronouns and name the young person requests you use. This may include checking in at each session and using a different name and pronoun when their family is present if this is more comfortable for them. Explore the power in the system and the political climate in which you are seeing a TGNDB person.

Self-awareness and regulation
Values as anchors
Personal skills development
Healing in relationship connection The KCCM Goal
Barriers
Values
Openers
Take Action
Listen
Respond
Repeat Use both clinician skill and client perspective to understand the problem
Collaborate and jointly define the problem. Jointly formulate a hypothesis regarding the cause of the problem. Jointly develop ways to confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis on the problem, continuing to consider alternative hypotheses. Test out the hypothesis using both the client and the therapist as evaluators. If the conceptualization appears to be valid, develop a treatment plan. If the hypothesis is not borne out, jointly collect additional data and formulate new, testable hypotheses. Deliberate practice is individualized training activities specially designed by a coach or teacher to improve specific aspects of an individual's performance through repetition and successive refinement. Deliberate practice is an evidenced-based method of skill development.
Deliberate practice works best when training targets each student's personal skill thresholds or current ability. If a deliberate practice exercise is either too easy or too hard, the student is unlikely to benefit from it.
To maximize training productivity, performers follow a 'challenging but not overwhelming' training principle. This means that deliberate practice requires ongoing assessment of the student's current skill and tailoring the difficulty of exercises to consistently target a 'good enough' challenge. Skill Criteria for Attention to Diversity Convey a brief empathic response to a client/family member that indicates you hear their problem or the session content. Reflect on the problem/session content, looking for opportunities to deepen the conversation as it relates to their identity and unique experiences. Ask a question that conveys continued empathy and curiosity about their identity and unique experiences with the problem. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/1.-intro-to-diversity-in-cft/5.-multicultural-barriers-in-therapy-and-culturally-competent-assessment.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/1.

Critical Race Theory (CRT) states that, 'Racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental categorization, attitude and discourse.' (Stefancic and Delgado, 2012, p. 21) and it challenges the 'ontological and epistemological biases subtly inculcated in the law, policies, or in empirical research that would otherwise hinter contextualization of harm and dysfunction resulting from racial stratification.' (Brown, 2003, p. 294) CRT helps focus our attention on the recursive interactions between institutionalized and interpersonal discrimination. Through the application of CRT to counseling and psychotherapy it is possible to interrogate the Eurocentric, ethnocentric and individualistic ways in which mental health practices are undertaken. Clients in need of psychological support can then be given a safe space for them to explore (in their own vernacular if necessary) their experiences of living in a capitalistic, racist, and misogynistic world. <br><a data-href="Remediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/remediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Remediation</a> The action of remedying something, in particular of reversing or stopping environmental damage. <br><a data-href="Prevention" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/prevention.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prevention</a> The action of stopping something from happening or arising. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/1.-intro-to-diversity-in-cft/4.-the-impact-of-systemic-oppression-in-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/1.

Any oppressive system has the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal. The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change. The -isms all work to establish a defined norm or standard of rightness under which everyone is judged. This defined norm is backed up with individual and institutional violence which makes the oppression possible. The defined norm is a notion that all of us might accept and promote for various reasons probably connected to a sense of inferiority or economic vulnerability. 'Whiteness as Poverty' argues that law has come to embody and legitimize benefits that accrue to citizens just because they are right. Despite the end to formal racial discrimination in the legal system race matters in how the law is carried out. Due to the embedded racism in American society, Whiteness can be considered a property interest. Right of Possession
Right to Use and Enjoyment
Right to Disposition
Right of Exclusion Critics of Harris' argument suggest that distributive justice sets up harm for the dominant group (in this case whites). Harris argues, "Acknowledging Black identity does not involve the systematic subordination of whites, nor does it even set up a danger of doing so." <br><a data-href="Equality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/equality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Equality</a> Treating everyone the same (aims to promote fairness) <br><a data-href="Equity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/equity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Equity</a> Giving everyone what they need to be successful (may appear unfair) A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. This occurs when social structures that create and organize different social groups, e.g., gender and race, interact to produce effects that may not be intended. Example: Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment. This occurs when the political movements working towards justice for different groups, e.g., feminism and antiracism, interact to exclude or marginalize the interests of some subset of the groups, or reinforced another form of injustice. Examples: For women of color anti-racist and feminist political agendas often conflict with one another
This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism. A concept that refers to the cultural construction of an identity, including the production and the contemporary critiques of the identity. This occurs when images or tropes are taken to be representative of the group ignore or distort the complexity of the group. <br>"Representational intersectionality would include both the ways in which these images are produced through a confluence of prevalent narrative of race and gender, as well as the recognition of how contemporary critiques of racist and sexist representations marginalize women of color." (<a data-href="@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991</a>, p. 1283) The experience of being a member of more than one social group that cannot be decomposed into the experience of being a member of each. Example: The experience of being a Black woman is not just the experience of being Black and the experience of being a woman. The experience of being a Black woman is a proper compound of the two. Critical Race Theory (CRT) states that, 'Racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental categorization, attitude and discourse.' (Stefancic and Delgado, 2012, p. 21) and it challenges the 'ontological and epistemological biases subtly inculcated in the law, policies, or in empirical research that would otherwise hinter contextualization of harm and dysfunction resulting from racial stratification.' (Brown, 2003, p. 294) CRT helps focus our attention on the recursive interactions between institutionalized and interpersonal discrimination. Through the application of CRT to counseling and psychotherapy it is possible to interrogate the Eurocentric, ethnocentric and individualistic ways in which mental health practices are undertaken. Clients in need of psychological support can then be given a safe space for them to explore (in their own vernacular if necessary) their experiences of living in a capitalistic, racist, and misogynistic world. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/1.-intro-to-diversity-in-cft/3.-understanding-oppression,-identity,-and-intersectionality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/1.

Family dynamics
Historical factors
Social and political context Much of my identity is determined by who the world around me says that I am? (i.e. Who do my parents, peers, teachers, neighbors, the media, the culture say that I am?) 'The looking glass self' Charles Cooley Other people are the mirror by which I see myself
This is a multidimensional reflection of myself The social, cultural, and historical context is the ground in which individual identity is embedded - Erik Erickson Identity formation is a process 'located within the core of the individual and yet in the core of their communal culture' We must then integrate our past, present, and future into a cohesive unified self over the life course. In the US, there are several categories of 'otherness' commonly experienced by people in our society. These categories are based on the following characteristics: Race or ethnicity
Gender
Religion
Sexual orientation
Socioeconomic status
Age
Physical or mental ability In relation to otherness there is always a form of oppression connected to the various categories (i.e. racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, etc.) In every case there is a group considered dominant - systemically advantaged by society and a group considered subordinate or targeted (systemically disadvantaged) Inequitable social relationships are seen as the model for 'normal human relationships' I am from... (place, landscape, familiar, sights, smells growing up)
I am from (traditions, music you remember growing up)
I am from (ancestors, relatives, people in your life now, nonviolence heroes and sheroes) Multicultural counseling and therapy can be defined as both a helping role and a process that uses modalities and defines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients; recognizes client identities to include individual, group, and universal dimensions; advocates the use of universal and culture-specific stratefies and roles in the helping process; and balances the importance of individualism and collectivism in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of client and client systems.

Type: Book
Title: Re-visioning family therapy: addressing diversity in clinical practice, Editor: McGoldrick, Monica; Hardy, Kenneth V.; Publisher: Guilford Press,
Location: New York, NY,
Year: 2019 ISBN: 978-1-4625-3973-4
"A leading text for courses that go beyond the basics of family systems theory, intervention techniques, and diversity, this influential work has now been significantly revised with 65% new material. The volume explores how family relationships--and therapy itself--are profoundly shaped by race, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other intersecting dimensions of marginalization and privilege. Chapters from leading experts guide the practitioner to challenge assumptions about family health and pathology, understand the psychosocial impact of oppression, and tap into clients' cultural resources for healing. Practical clinical strategies are interwoven with theoretical insights, case examples, training ideas, and therapists' reflections on their own cultural and family legacies"-- Provided by publisher

It is a product of the forces or interactions among its parts. It's parts cannot be understood separately.
The interdependence creates organization in the system (e.g., a family). <br><a data-href="Hierarchy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchy</a>: Systems tend to be embedded within one another.
Every complex system consists of subsystems. Given that systems are within systems, it is fuzzy as to where to locate the boundary between the system and the environment. Interchange with the Environment: Inputs and outputs.

Sensing deviations from the norm and correcting those 'faults.' Self-Regulation and Control: Systems are often viewed as goal-oriented.
They are governed by their purposes. The parts operate according to guidelines and adapt to the environment on the basis of feedback. This aspect of system functioning is cybernetics. Change and Adaptability: The system must adapt to its environment. Equifinality: A particular final state may be achieved in different ways.

All families have such a loop or <a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a> for communicating.

Learning Problems vs. Problems about Learning
Problems as Bad Solutions
Problems arising from childhood wounds, outmoded, limiting coping styles
Problems arising from Larger Societal Changes (and Issues) The Presenting Problem: A presenting problem is an initial symptom that causes a person to seek professional help. Describe the reason the client came to you. Include the client's definition of their problem. How long they've been experiencing the issue. Process: Understanding Process: <br><a data-href="Content" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/content.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Content</a>: Stories about what happened; shared at length and with extraneous details <br><a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>: Access the client's internal experience and working through parts of it. Process Questions in Therapy: <br>When a client is discussing something important to them tell the initial story and listen until your client invites you to help them. Otherwise, and after initial sessions you should mostly ask '<a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>' questions that: Focus on the client themselves and their internal experience
Help the client 'slow down' and reflect on ideas or feelings that seem significant
Use immediacy to ask about emotions you're noticing in a moment
Focus on themes, patterns, and affect Example of Process Questions in Therapy: "What is it like for you when..."
"I might be off here, but were you feeling... in that moment?"
When you notice heightened emotion, you can ask, "What's coming up for you right now?", "How are you feeling, talking to me about this?"
"What do you wish other people knew about what you are experiencing?"
"Today or in our previous sessions, have you found yourself thinking 'I wish they'd ask me about....?" "What question do you need someone to ask you, that no one has?"
"How did that make you feel about yourself, about your partner, about the relationship?"
"What you just mentioned about X seems important, at least to me. Could we slow down and stay with this idea/feeling for a moment?" Patterns: Observable repeated behavior, thoughts, or interaction that often manifest in human interaction and may manifest in therapy sessions. For example, a client may have a patter of shutting down emotionally or becoming distracted whenever you approach painful material. Writing a Systemic Hypothesis: Circular Questioning: Circular questioning is a technique used in systemic family therapy to 'invite participants in a conversation to consider relational aspects of the topic being investigated.' Ask open questions to explore communication and relationship patterns Types of Circular Questions: Bridging the Past: Circular questions bridge the past and the present together to find a moment in time when a shift in the family occurred. If this moment can be identified, it can give clues as to how to help the family. Has conflict always happened like this in your family?
What was it like before?
When did it start happening like this? Thirds: Circular questioning often asks a third person for their thoughts on how a dyad operates. This often breaks an unspoken rule in families that states, 'We don't comment about others.' This technique invites reflection on how two people's actions impact the behavior or mood of another. These questions are often used to assess how families respond to their members in different situations. "Dad, when Son is showing signs of depression, what do you see Mom do?"
"Mom, when Dad is taking care of Son, what do you think Dad gets out of?" Differences: When a behavior occurs or a significant change occurred different family members reacted in different ways. Circular questions help us understand the different ways people reacted and from that we can gauge how close people are, or how distant, enmeshment, and various other ideas. How is this different than before?
Who is most likely to comfort...?
Who is least likely?
Has this always been true?

A set of rules governing behavior patterns
Structures typically have some form of hierarchical structure. Reciprocal and complementary functions. Parental involvement with children, over versus under involvement. Structure is expressed through transactional patterns such as: <br><a data-href="Hierarchy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchy</a> Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system.

Patterns of interaction are largely based on roles and rules. Covert coalitions are often more significant than obvious groupings. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers.'
Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple
Parental
Child/Sibling <br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> Each subsystems is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries.

Rigid Boundaries (Disengaged Subsystem) <br>Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in <a data-href="Disengagement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/disengagement.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Disengagement</a>.

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.
The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.
The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. Theoretical Formulations: Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. But rather by a functioning structure Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. Problems arise when there are: Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions
Inflexible structures
Failure to adjust to changing circumstances Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment.

Enactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems
Therapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences.

Mapping structural patterns (Observing enmeshment and disengagement) Focus on the underlying family structure: Highlight and modify interactions
Intensity (interrupt rigid and difficult patters)
"Challenging to be effective must be predicated on the client's strengths. Contrary to a common misconception, it is not the 'opposite' of joining. Joining and challenging need to be seen as simultaneous qualities in any therapeutic intervention."

Modernism vs. Postmodernism: Postmodernism was a response in many ways to modernism and, hence, they can be considered to be two aspects of the same movement. But there are major differences between modernism and postmodernism. Two central tenets of the Enlightenment (beginning of the 'modern' period) were as follows: The perfectibility of human nature
The belief in human progress through the development of human knowledge, especially the sciences. In the 20
th century, scientific findings, like quantum physics, seriously undermined the possibility of a deterministic model of the world. As a guiding principle, reason was still affirmed as was the belief in human progress. The project of modernism was to examine the impediments still holding society back. Individuals ceased to believe that art and literary works bore one unique meaning; rather, postmodernists believed in deriving their own meanings from works of art and literature.
Modernism: It was an emancipatory project whose main idea was that traditional values and institutions were oppressive, divisive and inefficient and should, therefore, be replaced by rational values and institutions. Modernism led to progress in many spheres of life by changing the approach of mankind towards culture. Ultimately, modernism attempted to free humanity from its historical baggage through the use of philosophy and science. Postmodernism: Postmodernism was a reaction to modernism and was influenced by disenchantment brought on by the second world war. Postmodernism refers to the state that lacks a central hierarchy and one that is complex, ambiguous, and diverse. Postmodernists are the nihilists.
Postmodernists like Heidegger, Derrida, and Lyotard attacked the modernist belief in rationality, objectivity and universalism in favor of relativism (the view that there is no objective truth) as well as identity.
Grand narratives like freedom, societal progress, scientific progress were criticized by postmodernists, who instead emphasized that difference, rather than forced unity, should be celebrated. Postmodernism is a backlash against modernity. The collapse of tradition created a frightening situation whereby meaning became difficult to discern amid the horror of societal breakdown. Postmodernism, hence, represented a loss in faith in human reason. Postmodernism provides a bleak prognosis of the human condition and offers no real solutions. Conclusion:
- Modernism and postmodernism were both movements that emerged from an analysis of events within the modern period from the perspective of the values of the Enlightenment.
<a data-href="Postmodernism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/postmodernism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Postmodernism</a>: Theory that knowledge of things are not real unless we give them meaning.
The sense of self is a social construct. Our identity is created by interactions with other people and our reactions to society. Two threads: Weak (Social Constructionism): Proposes that social constructs are dependent on brute facts (most basic and fundamental facts and do not rely on other facts).
Institutional facts are created by social conventions and rely on other facts. Strong (Social): The whole of reality is dependent on social habits. All knowledge is a social construct and there are no brute facts. It would say we created the idea of something and how to explain it. Main criticism: Does not take into consideration the effect of natural phenomenon that goes on in society. Social constructionism only explains reality through the thoughts of humans, not by using fundamental brute facts. <br><a data-href="Michael White" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/michael-white.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Michael White</a>

The Narrative Metaphor: Focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. \Problems affect people. Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. Hence letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams. The truth of experience is not DISCOVERED, it is CREATED.
Narrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narratives of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new future. People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-stories aspects of their lives and relationships. Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. We 'story' and create meaning of life events using available dominant discourses - broad social stories, practices, assumptions, and expectations about how we should live.
'Problems':
Experienced when a person's personal life does not fit with these societal discourses and expectations. Process involves separating the person from the problem. Understanding Oppression: Dominant vs. Local Discourses Dominant discourses are culturally generated stories about how life should go. Local discourses occur in our heads, our closer relationships, and marginalized communities. Narrative therapists help clients become aware of how these different discourses are impacting their lives. Avoid judgements about what is 'normal.'
Avoid categorizing. Avoid the idea of general principles of what causes problems or what resolves them. The stories people tell themselves. Interpret their experience in unhelpful ways. Patterns of tunnel vision. Problem-saturated stories take hold and encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Separate the problem-saturated stories to open space for: New and more constructive views of themselves.
Look for unique outcomes 'Sparking events' Deconstruction: View the problem as an external entity to start challenging its influence. Unique Outcomes: Resistance to the problem's influence
Opens room for counter stories Involves finding new ways to view, interact with, and respond to problems by defining the role of the problems in their lives. Broadly involves the following phases: Meeting
Listening
Separating persons from problems
Enacting preferred narratives
Solidifying Process thickens and enriches a person's identity and life accounts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. At the end of each meeting, the therapists asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
Then, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
Meetings are typically 60 minutes
Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between) Collaborative
Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem
With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem
Takes notes of what works and what doesn't
Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation Meeting the person apart from the problem
Separating people from problems: The problem is the problem Optimism and hope
Co-author/co-editor
Investigate reporter Problem-saturated stories
Unique outcomes and sparkling events
Dominant cultural and gender discourses
Local and alternative discourses: Attending to client language and meaning Holds a position of curiosity.
Cherishes each person/family's unique stories. Invite clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. Narrative Therapy Principles: Therapist influential, but decentered.
Person separate from problem. All problems have exceptions. Opposite of problem is preferred. Preferred story woven into identity. Impact of relationships explored. Deconstruct societal norms. Personal decision making supported. Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. The problem is the problem. Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family. <br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>: There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (reexamining) established truths that oppress people's lives. People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems).
People are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. People are not their problems. People can develop alternative empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. Reject categorizing people. In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves WITH clients. They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis).
Want to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relationships. When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relation to it. Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict. Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story
Problems may be regarded as alien invaders Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)
Open space for new and more constructive views of themselves. Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy
Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions
<br><a data-href="Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience
Effects Questions: Elicit effects of the problem "How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationship?"
"Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful." Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multistoried lives.
Once people notice how their stories are problem saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time
At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
Then, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
Meetings are typically 60 minutes
Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between) CAUTION: Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories INSTEAD: narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories Counterstory Asking permission is central to the model
At the start of the first meeting, the therapist ask if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy.
Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from the previous session aloud and asking question, such as: Can you tell me about new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time Other times the therapist begins by wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations
Therapists use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session
Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem
Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keeping a story alive and growing Collaborative
Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem.
Takes note of what works and what doesn't
Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation Therapy is a relationship - a conversation Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories
Open space for describing alternatives
Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently
Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments
The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders
Therapists have more questions than answers It sounds as though problem is part of your life now.
How long have you been noticing this problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
How does the problem impact your relationships?
Does problem have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects the problem is having on your life?
Are you accepting what problem is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what problem is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.
The therapist invites family members to: Evaluate their current situation
Name the problems involved
Evaluate their relationship to those problems
Take a stand in regard to them
Tell more satisfying stories of their lives
Evaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. Private hopes and fears
Family interactions
Contributions of culture of origin
Traditions, legacies Questioning: Is that the problem speaking?
Whose values are guiding you in saying that? By exposing discouses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What talks have you have about the problem in your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
Is this conversation useful? How is it useful? Externalizing conversations
Relatice influence questions Who's in charge, the person or the problem? Identifying unique outcomes Reading between the lines of the problem story
Can you remember a time... Reauthoring What does it say about you... Illuminating or creating the counter-story
Reinforcing the new story Finding audiences, supportive witnesses, allies
Letter writing Deconstructing destructive cultural assumptions Listen to stories as stories.
Be attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story.
Ask about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationship.
Make sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem.'
Unless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences.
At some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories.
Try to put yourself in their shoes.
Do not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them
Listen and ask
Listen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust. Listen 'deconstructively' to family stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings.
Ask families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning.
We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'? Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society/
Develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work win the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult.
There are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play.
Deconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that suppose them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses. The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem.
Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people.
As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families. If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them. What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it.
As we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem.
What are the family's preferred directions?
'Standing against' the problem. Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes? Is the problem always with you? Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives.
Double listening. If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled.
If a person experiences injustive, they must have a conception of a just world.
When we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications. Stories need listeners as well as tellers.
Attentive witnesses.
The therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful.
What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking? It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions. Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who then amplify and accredit the stories that they witness. What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience.
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives. We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive. We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop. We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud. We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems. We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions. In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session. Our intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session. We might invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives. Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but didn't? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict...? Aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. Reality is socially constructed.
Reality is influenced by and communicated through language.
Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality.
There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. Telling One's Story: A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. Externalization Technique: Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. Deconstruction Technique: This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. Unique Outcomes Technique: To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that doesn't include your most pervasive problems. Some families prefer a different kind of therapy than narrative, some are seeking instruction and expert advice.
Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve
Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice
More qualitative research rather than quantitative studies
Little empirical support currently exists
Randomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist.

Title: The New Peoplemaking
Author: Satir, Virginia Keywords: <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:In-Progress" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#In-Progress">#In-Progress</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Virginia-Satir" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Virginia-Satir">#Virginia-Satir</a> To understand the world, we can study the family: issues such as power, intimacy, autonomy, trust, and communication skills are vital parts underlying how we live in the world. To change the world is to change the family.
Family life is something like an iceberg: most people are aware of only about one-tenth of what is going on - the tenth that they can see and hear. Just as a sailor's fate depends on knowing that the bulk of the iceberg is under the water, so a family's fate depends on understanding the feelings and needs that lie beneath every family events. (What goes on under the table?) Over the years I have developed a picture of what human beings living humanly are like. They are people who understand, value, and develop their bodies, finding them beautiful and useful. They are real and honest to and about themselves and others; they are loving and kind to themselves and others. People living humanly are willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, and to change when the situation calls for it. They find ways to accommodate what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not. The family is the context in which a person with such dimensions developers. And the adults in charge are the peoplemakers. Four aspects of family life: The feelings and ideas one has about oneself, which I call self-worth. The ways people use to work out meaning with one another, which I call communication.
The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into what I call the family system.
The way people relate to other people and institutions outside the family, which I call the link to society. In all the troubled families I noticed that: Self-wroth was low
Communication was indirect, vague, and not really honest
Rules were indirect, nonnegotiable, and everlasting
The family's link to society was fearful, placating, and blaming In all nurturing families, I consistently see a different pattern: Self-worth is high
Communication is direct, clear, specific, and honest
Rules are flexible, human, appropriate, and subject to change
The link to society is open and hopeful, and is based on choice The changes all rest on new learnings, new awareness, and a new consciousness. Everyone can achieve these. Families everywhere deal with the same issues. In all families... Every person communicates; the question is, How, and what happens as a result? Every person follows rules; the question is, What kind, and how well do they work for them? Every person is linked to society; the question is, In what way, and what are the results? Natural Family The man and woman who sired and conceived the child continue to care for that child until the child is grown One-Parent Family One parent leaves the family by death, divorce, or desertion, and all of the parenting is done by the remaining parent Blended Family Children are parented by step-, adoptive, foster, or gay parents Institutional Family Groups of adults rear groups of children, as in institutions, communes, or extended families The same forces will be at work in all families: Self-Worth
Communication
Rules
Links to Society People are always doing the best they can. Developing a family is the hardest, most complicated job in the world. The very fact that you are reading this tells me that you care about yourself and the well-being of your family. Knowing something begins a change; experiencing makes it happen. If you feel shy or doubtful about inviting family members to participate in these exercises with you, become thoroughly familiar with what you are asking, feel it from your heart, and present your wish simply and directly. "Will you participate with me in an experiment that I think might be useful to use?" You maximize the opportunity for a positive response. Badgering, demanding, or nagging people to go along turns the transaction into a power struggle. <br>(I think this may be refer to the <a data-href="Battle for Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Structure</a> and the <a data-href="Battle for Initiative" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Initiative</a>) I see two kinds of pain: Pain of recognition of problems
Pain of blame
The first we can't avoid; the second we can. We can direct our effects to change what we can and to work out creative ways to live with what we can't change. <br><a data-href="Serenity Prayer" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/serenity-prayer.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Serenity Prayer</a> Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Does it feel good to you to live in your family right now?
Do you feel you are living with friends, people you like and trust, and who like and trust you?
Is it fun and exciting to be a member of your family?
Family that is more or less troubled does not mean you have a bad family. It only means that people aren't very happy and have not learned ways to love and value one another openly. Families can be placed somewhere along a scale from 'very nurturing' to 'very troubled' The atmosphere in a troubled family is easy to feel. I quickly sense discomfort. Sometimes it feels cold. Sometimes it feels as if everything were constantly spinning, like a top; I get dizzy and can't find my balance. Or it may be an atmosphere of foreboding, like the lull before a storm, when thunder may crash and lightning strike at any moment. Sometimes I feel very sad and cannot find an obvious reason. I realize that's because the sources are covered up. I begin to understand why so many members of troubled families were beset with physical ills. Their bodies were simply reacting humanly to a very inhuman atmosphere. Everybody has physical reactions to individuals around him or her. The first step of change is to recognize what is happening. There is little evidence of friendship among individual family members, little joy in one another. The family seems to stay together through duty, with people just trying to tolerate one another. More often humor is caustic, sarcastic, even cruel. The adults are so busy telling the child and each other what to do and what not to do that they never get to enjoy themselves as persons. In some families, people simply avoided one another. The family can be the place where one finds love and understanding and support, even when all else fails; where we can be refreshed and recharged to cope more effectively with the world outside. No one would intentionally pick this troubled way of living. Families accept it only because they know of no other way. A nurturing family is where I would be listened to and would be interested in listening to others; I would be considered and would wish to consider others. I could openly show my affection as well as my pain and disapproval. I would not be afraid to take risks because everyone in my family would realize that some mistakes are bound to come with my risk-taking - that my mistakes are a sign that I am growing. I would feel like a person in my own right - noticed, valued, loved, and clearly asked to notice, value, and love others. I would feel free to respond with humor and laughter when it fits. The houses in which these people live tend to have a lot of light and color. Clearly a place where people live, these homes are planned for their comfort and enjoyment, not as showplaces for the neighbors. When there is quiet, it is peaceful quiet, not the stillness of fear and caution. Each person seems to know that they will have the chance to be heard. If one's turn doesn't come now, it is only because there isn't time - not because one isn't loved. People seem comfortable about touching one another and showing their affection, regardless of age. People show their loving and caring by talking openly and listening with concern, being straight and real with one another, and simply being together. Members of a nurturing family feel free to tell each other how they feel. Anything can be talked about. Nurturing families can make plans. If something interferes with the plan, they can readily make adjustments, often with a sense of humor. This way they are able to handle more of life's problems without panicking. Thus the incident would be used as a learning opportunity (which raises the child's self-worth) rather than as a cause for punishment, which puts that self-worth into question. In the nurturing family it is easy to pick up the message that human life and human feelings are more important than anything else. These parents see themselves as empowering leaders, not as authoritative bosses. They see their job primarily as one of teaching their children how to be truly human in all situations. The behavior of these parents matches what they say. How different from the troubled parent who tells the children not to hurt each other, but slaps them whenever displeased. Parents are people; they learn that good leaders are careful of their timing: they watch for an opportunity to talk to their children when they can really be heard. When a child has misbehaved, the father or mother moves physically close to offer support. This helps the offending child overcome fear and guilt feelings and make the best of the teaching the parent is about to offer. We can help make new contacts with others and pave the way for better ways of dealing with each other. Parents in nurturing families know that their children are not intentionally bad. If someone behaves destructively, parents realize some misunderstanding has arisen or someone's self-esteem is dangerously low. They know people learn only when valuing themselves and feeling valued, so they don't respond to behavior in a way that will make people feel devalued. Even when it is possible to change behavior by shaming or punishing, the resulting scar is not easily or quickly healed. When a child must be corrected, nurturing parents rely on being clear: Asking for information, listening, touching, understanding, using careful timing, and being aware of the child's feelings and natural wishes to learn and to please. Children learn from the modeling of direct behavior. Parents in a nurturing family realize problems come along, simply because life offers them, and they will be alert to creative solutions as each new problem appears. Troubled families, on the other hand, put all their energies into the hopeless attempt to keep problems from happening; when they do happen - and, of course, they always do - these people have no resources left for solving the crisis. Nurturing parents realize change is inevitable. They accept change as part of being alive and try to use it creatively to make their families still more nurturing. The human heart is always seeking love. Troubled families make troubled people and thus contribute to the devaluing of self. Giving ourselves full permission to make the family a place to develop people who are more truly human will reflect itself in a safer and more humanly responsive world. We can make the family a real place for developing real people. Each of us is a discovery, and each of us makes a difference. Most of the things that caused families to be troubled are learned after birth. Since they are learned, they can be unlearned, and new things can be learned in their place. You need to recognize that your family sometimes is a troubled family. You need for forgive yourself for past mistakes and give yourself permission to change, knowing that things can be different. Make a decision to change things. Take some action to start the process of change. Whatever may have happened in the past represented the best you knew how to do at the time. Chances are that the causes of your family pain have been invisible to all of you. <br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is a concept, an attitude, a feeling, an image; and it is represented by behavior. When I was a little girl, I lived on a farm in Wisconsin. On our back porch was a huge black iron pot, which had lovely rounded sides and stood on three legs. My mother made her own soap, so for part of the year the pot was filled with soap. When threshing crews came through in the summer, we filled the pot with stew. At other times, my father used it to store manure for my mother's flower beds. We came to call it the "3-S pot." Anyone who wanted to use the pot faced two questions: What is the pot now full of, and how full is it? When people told me about themselves - whether they felt full, empty, dirty, or even 'cracked' - I thought of that old pot. Pot is a plain word in this use, almost a nonsense word. Families often find it easier to express themselves in pot terms and to understand when other people express themselves this way. When I say 'pot,' I mean self-worth or self-esteem. Every person has a feeling of worth, positive or negative. As with my old family pot, the questions are: Is my self-worth negative or positive at this point, and how much of it is there? <br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is the ability to value one's self and to treat oneself with dignity, love, and reality. Anyone who is loved is open to change. The crucial factor in what happens both inside people and between people is one's self-worth, one's pot. Integrity, honesty, responsibility, compassion, love, and competence - all flow easily from people whose self-esteem is high. We feel that we matter, that the world is a better place because we are here. We have faith in our own competence. We are able to ask others for help, yet we believe we can make our own decisions and are, in the end, our own best resources. Appreciating our own worth, we are ready to see and respect the worth of others. We radiate trust and hope. We don't have rules against anything we feel. We also know that we don't have to act on everything we feel. We can choose. Our intelligence directs our actions. We accept all of ourselves as human. Vital people feel high-pot most of the time. But vital people treat these temporary low-pot feelings as just what they are: a crisis of the moment. This crisis might well be the birth pains of some new possibility for us. We may feel uncomfortable at the time but do not have to hide. We know we can emerge from this crisis whole. When people feel they have little worth, they expect to be cheated, stepped on, and depreciated by others. This opens the way to becoming a victim. Expecting the worst, these people invite it and usually get it. To defend themselves, they hide behind a wall of distrust and sink into the terrible feeling of loneliness and isolation. Thus separated from other people, they become apathetic, indifferent toward themselves and those around them. It is hard for them to see, hear, or think clearly, and therefore they tend to step on and depreciate others. People who feel this way build huge psychological walls behind which they hide, and then defend themselves by denying they are doing this. Fear is a natural consequence of this distrust and isolation. Fear constricts and blinds us; it keeps us from risking new ways of solving our problems. Instead, we turn to still more self-defeating behavior. (Fear, incidentally, is always fear of some future thing) As soon as a person confronts or challenges whatever they are afraid of in the present, the fear vanishes. When persons with constant low-pot feelings experience defeat, they often label themselves as failures. After enough of these reactions, the self is vulnerable to drugs, alcohol, or others flights from coping. Feeling low is not the sameas low-pot. Low pot essentially means that when you experience undesireable feelings, you try to behave as though those feelings did not exist. It takes a lot of high self-worth to acknowledge your low feelings. Persons of high self-esteem can feel low. The difference is that people who are feeling low don't label themselves as worthless or pretend that their low feelings do not exist. Nor do they project their feeling on someone else. It makes a big difference whether one condemns one's self or sees this low time as a human condition with which one needs to cope. I shall be frequently calling your attention to this process of coping. Feeling low and not admitting it is a form of lying to yourself and others. Devaluing your feelings this way is a direct link to devaluing yourself, thus deepening the conditions of low pot. Much of what happens to us is the outcome of our attitude. Since it is attitude, we can change it. To build your self-worth: Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. An infant coming into the world must rely on experiences with people and their messages about their worth as a person. For the first five or six years, the child's self-esteem is formed almost exclusively by the family. After the child starts school, other influences come into play; the family remains important. Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication).
Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued?
Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere in which individual differences are appreciated, love is shown openly, mistakes are used for learning, communication is open, rules are flexible, responsibility (matching promise with delivery) is modeled and honest is practiced - the kind of atmosphere found in a nurturing family. Children in troubled families often feel worthless, growing up as they must amid 'crooked' communication, inflexible rules, criticism of their differentness, punishment for their mistakes, and no experience in learning responsibility. Such children are highly at risk of developing destructive behavior toward themselves and/or others. Much of an individual's potential is held in abeyance when this happens. Parents with high self-esteem are more likely to create nurturing families, and low self-worth parents to produce troubled families. The system evolves out of the architects of the family: the parents. I do hold parents responsible for accepting the consequences of their actions and learning to do differently. This is a good first step to improving the whole family situation. <br>It is possible to raise anyone's <a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a>, no matter what one's age or condition. Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. "There is always hope that your life can change, because you can always learn new things."
<br><a data-href="My Declaration of Self-Esteem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/my-declaration-of-self-esteem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">My Declaration of Self-Esteem</a> Our body language and activities reflect our thoughts and emotions. When we appreciate and love ourselves, our energy builds. When we use this energy positively and harmoniously to make a smoothly running system within each self, it creates a strong foundation from which that self can cope creatively, realistically, and compassionately with what life presents. "When I feel good about myself and life myself, the chances are excellent that I will be able to meet life from a position of dignity, honesty, strength, love, and reality." If a person's feeling toward themselves is one of depreciation, limitation, disgust, or any other negative attitude, the energy becomes diffused and fragmented. The self weakens, becoming a victim defeated by life: "If I do not like myself, I devalue and punish myself. I meet life from a position of fear and impotence, creating a state in which I feel victimized and act according. I punish myself and others blindly. I become interchangeably subservient and tyrannical. I hold others responsible for my actions." A person feels they do not count, feel a constant threat of rejection, and lacks the ability to look at themselves, others, and events in perspective. This is a state of low self-esteem.
A person who does not value themselves will expect someone else to be responsible for bestowing that value. This often leads to endless manipulations that usually backfire on both parties. To avoid being against others, people have been taught to love others instead of themselves. This results in self-depreciation. The question also arises, if one does not love self, how can one know how to love others? We have plenty of evidence that loving oneself makes it possible to love others; self-worth and selfishness are not the same. I have found that the first step toward diminishing fear is to acknowledge it openly. Then check your perception: "Is that true?" Fear of Rejection Good human relations and appropriate and loving behavior stem from persons who have strong feelings of self-worth. Simply stated, persons who love and value themselves are able to love and value others and treat reality appropriately. Having a strong sense of self-worth is the way to become more fully human, to having health and happiness, gaining and maintaining satisfying relationships, and being appropriate, effective, and responsible. When one cares for oneself, one will not do anything to injure, degrade, humiliate, or otherwise destroy oneself or another, and will not hold others responsible for one's actions. People who care for themselves would not violate their relationships to others through violence. Those who do not love themselves can easily become instruments of hate and destruction by unscrupulous people. They essentially give away their power, which often leads to emotional slavery. Perpetual placating exemplifies this. The stronger one's self-worth, the easier it is to have and maintain the courage to change one's behavior. The more one values oneself, the less one demands from others. The less one demands from others, the more one can feel trust. The more one trusts oneself and others, the more one can love. The more one loves others, the less one fears them. The more one builds with them, the more one can know them. The more one knows another, the greater is one's bond and bridge with them. Self-worth behavior will thus help end the isolation and alienation between persons, groups, and nations today. <br>(MA: is this referencing <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>?)

This book focuses on students, a pragmatic approach to treatment, regard for multidisciplinary perspectives, and respect for the influence of families on clients. Chapter 1 identifies concerns that new therapists frequently have, such as building confidence in their clinical work. Chapters 2-6 follow the usual time sequence of therapy--from initial contact with clients, to comprehensive assessment, to treatment planning and intervention. Chapters 7-10 deal with specific clinical situations based on presenting problems and the nature of client families. We examine major issues and approaches for working with children and adolescents, older adults, couples, and families that are struggling with serious mental illness. Chapter 11 highlights some common obstacles all therapists encounter, and provides concrete ideas on how to get unstuck when treatment is not progressing. Chapter 12 focuses on an often overlooked part of therapy--termination. In Chapter 13, we conclude the book by looking at emerging issues within family therapy" While family therapy offers a unique and important perspective in clinical work, much of what goes on in treatment shares common assumptions with all therapies.
assessing the appropriateness of a family therapy treatment for a specific problem is an essential clinical skill. It is important to be able to recognize when a problem is outside the scope of a family therapist‚Äôs practice (or skill level) and could best be treated by another mental health professional or in tandem with another healthcare professional.
A growing focus on treatment teams and multidisciplinary treatment approaches means that therapists must increasingly attend to the biological component of the biopsychosocial model and learn to collaborate with other healthcare professionals. Beginning therapists frequently experience feelings of inadequacy and insecurity about their clinical abilities Therapists and supervisors alike need to see confidence issues from a developmental perspective Paradoxically, the more one learns about how to do therapy, the more one realizes how much one doesn‚Äôt know.
Although the intensity of these feelings and the ways of coping will vary from therapist to therapist, every beginning therapist struggles to some degree with these feelings.
This disclosure helps the beginning therapist to accept that these struggles are developmentally appropriate rather than a sign of being unsuited for the profession
the therapist‚Äìclient relationship is inherently therapeutic. A therapist doesn‚Äôt need to do something for clients to have a positive experience.
early experiences in seeing clients often involve a steep learning curve
It takes time, however, to gain enough experience so that many situations become familiar.
examine if distorted cognitions or unrealistic expectations are contributing to their fears or struggles with confidence. Beginning therapists can struggle with perfectionistic tendencies or critical self-talk
The only pathway to becoming an experienced therapist was to go through the learning process that he was going through
Experienced clinicians indicated that after 5‚Äì7 years (or about 5,000‚Äì7,000 hours) of clinical experience, they had encountered most clinical issues or problems several times.
The intense feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed that are common in the beginning generally subside after 1‚Äì3 months of seeing clients. Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, ‚Äúself of the therapist‚Äù stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family. Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist‚Äôs ability to listen and attend to the client‚Äôs story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins. The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics. ‚ÄúI know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in the content.‚Äù Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
Therapists‚Äô unresolved issues or ‚Äúgrowth areas‚Äù can become impediments in therapy.
The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy. Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors. Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy. To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
You also need a strong social support network Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable Keep the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
Keep the following ‚Äòreminders‚Äô at hand:** Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities. The first contact is about to take place, and it can easily make or break a future collaboration where healing work can be done. One of the most critical points in the therapeutic experience: the period before therapy ever begins. During this fragile period prospective clients decide if they want to risk going to therapy. It is not uncommon for families to be at their wit's end when they finally decide to seek treatment or are referred and call for an appointment. Chances are they're worn out, fed up, and feeling hopeless. Individual family members may differ remarked For therapists and clients alike, beginning therapy can elicit feelings of fear, excitement, and nervous anticipation. Each client will take you on a different journey. In the first stage, the therapist welcomes the clients to therapy. The goal of this stage is to do introductions and put the clients at ease. Administrative issues are addressed in the second stage. The purpose of this stage is to ensure clients have a clear understanding of the therapy process, including confidentiality, videotaping, and fees. The goal-setting phase. Here the therapist learns what the clients hope to accomplish through therapy. The time devoted to goal setting will also depend on the number of clients being seen. Soliciting everyone‚Äôs perspective on goals within a family will generally take longer than working with an individual. Being able to establish goals for therapy is a realistic expectation. Assessment phase, which typically extends beyond the first interview. Therapist needs to accomplish several important tasks to make the initial interview successful. At each stage of the initial interview, you should be working on building your relationship with your clients. Important assessment information may also come out at any point in the first session, even before the therapist has begun a more formal assessment phase. The most crucial task of therapy is to successfully join with your clients.<br>

Joining is both a technique (developing rapport) and an attitude.
- It is the foundation for future work. Failure to successfully join with your clients will hamper all of your efforts, from assessment to treatment.<br>
- Failure to join with clients can lead to <a data-href="Premature Termination (PT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/premature-termination-(pt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premature Termination (PT)</a> of therapy.
- The therapist missed an opportunity to connect with the client and create a safe environment for therapy to take place.
- Joining is a process that should be carefully attended to throughout the entire initial interview.
- When you begin the session, you should attempt to put your clients at ease given that they are most likely anxious about coming to therapy.
- Ideally, you will be able to identify something you have in common with your clients that will help develop a sense of connection.
- Joining also takes place at other points throughout the initial interview.
- Highlight
Reflective listening, maintaining direct eye contact, or leaning forward can also reinforce for your clients that you are interested in them and concerned about what they are saying. Concluding the initial interview with a positive message for your clients can be another way to strengthen your connection.
-
Highlight
Although skills to facilitate joining can be learned
-
Highlight
developing a relationship with another person cannot be reduced to a recipe or set of techniques.
-
Highlight
who you are is the greatest asset you bring to therapy. Your personality, attitudes, life experiences, and compassion become a part of and help create the relationship.
-
Highlight
therapist characteristics can create a barrier to developing a connection. Therapists who have prejudices or negative preconceptions
-
Highlight
about people based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or religious orientation will likely have difficulty establishing a connection with clients who have these characteristics.
-
Highlight
you should be vigilant in assuring that personal issues or prejudices do not interfere with your developing a relationship with your clients.
-
Highlight
One of the early tasks in an initial interview is to address administrative issues so clients understand the therapy process.
-
Highlight
the therapist who is attuned to the process and not just the content when handling administrative issues may discover important opportunities for assessment or even intervention.
-
Highlight
need to be informed not only of the confidential nature of therapy, but also of the possible exceptions to confidentiality
-
Highlight
It is best practice to cover confidentially both orally and in writing with your client. The consent form for treatment
-
Highlight
should include what is and what is not kept confidential in therapy.
-
Highlight
Therapists working with couples and families must also consider how confidentiality among family members will be handled.
-
Highlight
The therapist must address the extent to which information obtained during these individual sessions will be kept confidential or shared with other family members.
-
Highlight
offer clear guidelines as to the bounds of confidentiality at the beginning of therapy.
-
Highlight
You may want to consult with other individuals or institutions connected with particular cases, such as previous therapists, psychiatrists, physicians, teachers, lawyers, courts, or parole officers.
-
Highlight
need to have clients sign a release of information form,
-
Highlight
to permit communication between you and the other parties.
-
Highlight
The signatures of all participants in therapy are required for the release of information.
-
Highlight
If others contact you about your clients, you should not even acknowledge that they are in therapy unless you have obtained the appropriate release of information.
-
Highlight
obtain a written release of information before discussing a case.
-
Highlight
Therapeutic issues may arise when discussing confidentiality with clients.
-
Highlight
You can tell your clients that you regularly consult with your supervisor, and that videotaping allows your supervisor to witness firsthand what happened in therapy.
-
Highlight
‚Äútwo heads are better than one.‚Äù
-
Highlight
videotaping allows you to review what happened in previous sessions and perhaps have a new insight,
-
Highlight
recording a session gives the therapist the option to replay part of the session for clients.
-
Highlight
You should inform the client who will view the recordings, emphasizing that videotapes are considered confidential information.
-
Highlight
recordings are not kept permanently, but are regularly erased or recorded over.
-
Highlight
Clients should be asked to sign a form giving their consent for videotaping sessions. The form should
-
Highlight
outline the purpose of the videotaping, who will view the recordings, and what will happen to the recordings after therapy is completed.
-
Highlight
Some clients may be reluctant to be videotaped.
-
Highlight
You should carefully explore what is behind their reservations.
-
Highlight
You should pay careful attention to clients who are insistent about not being videotaped given they are the exception rather than the rule. These clients often have sensitive information that they wish to protect or keep secret.
-
Highlight
If therapy will include live supervision or the use of observing/ reflecting teams, discuss this with your clients.
-
Highlight
helpful to allow clients, at their request, to meet supervisors or team members who observe the sessions from behind the one-way mirror.
-
Highlight
It is difficult to assign a monetary value to therapy, and therapists often feel uneasy about charging fees while acting in a helping role. Therapist anxiety about fees can easily be transferred to clients and can create conflict and stress in therapy. Comfort in handling fees will increase with therapeutic experience and confidence in your ability to provide a worthwhile service.
-
Highlight
There is a business aspect of the therapy relationship and discussing fees should be handled in a business-like manner.
-
Highlight
the client is purchasing a service.
-
Highlight
Most programs or clinicians establish a minimum fee and then work within a range.
-
Highlight
ou should discuss acceptable forms of payment, when the fee should be paid, and the fee for late cancellation or ‚Äúno-show‚Äù appointments, if applicable.
-
Highlight
useful to have a written agreement that discusses the fees and policies regarding fees.
-
Highlight
third-party payers limit the number of sessions, or the types of presenting problems or diagnoses they will reimburse.
-
Highlight
If a third-party payer is involved, the therapist should verify insurance coverage at the outset of therapy. Issues that need to be addressed may include provider eligibility, annual deductibles, rate of reimbursement, limitations on the number of sessions, or types of treatments covered. Usually a DSM-5 diagnosis will need to be assigned to the insured patient.
-
Highlight
As with other administrative issues, working out the details for payment can be part of the diagnostic process and help to clarify the family‚Äôs expectations of and responsibilities for therapy.
-
Highlight
Generally, free services tend not to be valued by clients. A fee, even a small one, provides some incentive to make effective use of services. Paying a fee also indicates that the therapy has value to the client.
-
Highlight
therapists may be required to discuss with clients their professional qualifications.
-
Highlight
Many agencies and practitioners have clients read and sign an informed consent statement that generally includes a brief description of what therapy is, including the potential risks, such as being asked to examine painful issues.
-
Highlight
define clients‚Äô expectations for what therapy will accomplish and how it will be conducted. This is essential to ensure that clients‚Äô needs are compatible with what you, as the therapist, can or are willing to offer.
-
Highlight
The first step in defining expectations is to ask your clients what they would like to accomplish through therapy.
-
Highlight
How can I be helpful to you?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat are you hiring me to do?
-
Highlight
Clients hope that you will be able to fix these problems. Individuals will often say what they want to eliminate
-
Highlight
and have a harder time articulating what they want
-
Highlight
If possible, encourage your clients to describe desired changes in positive language (what will be happening) rather than in negative language (what won‚Äôt be happening)
-
Highlight
It is important that each family member is given the opportunity to be heard when discussing problems and goals. This will help in joining with each individual.
-
Highlight
you may discover there is disagreement about the problem itself or who has the problem.
-
Highlight
You don‚Äôt want to anger the person who talks excessively, but if you fail to interrupt this behavior, other family members may lose faith in your ability to lead the session.
-
Highlight
In defining goals, a number of challenges can arise. Your clients may identify multiple problem areas, with little distinction of priorities.
-
Highlight
you will need to obtain your clients‚Äô perspective on the relative importance of their problems.
-
Highlight
‚ÄúOf the issues you have presented, which is most important, and which is least important?‚Äù
-
Highlight
your clients may not have a clear idea of what the problem is or what their goals for therapy are.
-
Highlight
may need to contract for a limited number of sessions to explore and define problem areas and goals.
-
Highlight
Another potential problem is that clients may have unrealistically high expectations or goals.
-
Highlight
Setting goals may be further complicated by the unstated agenda of a client, one that he or she feels is not appropriate to disclose.
-
Highlight
Sometimes, even the clients may not be totally aware of their reasons for seeking therapy.
-
Highlight
Alternatively, individuals in couples or families may define goals that initially appear incompatible.
-
Highlight
In these situations, you may need to creatively reframe the goals in such a way as to make them compatible or link them together.
-
Highlight
Once you have a clear understanding of what your clients want or expect from therapy, you need to decide whether it is appropriate for you to take on the case.
-
Highlight
you must assess whether the case is within your scope of practice, that is, whether the clients are expecting help for issues that would be considered appropriate for a family therapist to treat.
-
Highlight
The scope of practice is defined for therapists by the laws that license or certify therapists in their state.
-
Highlight
If the case falls outside your scope of practice, you will need to refer your clients to an appropriate professional.
-
Highlight
you need to assess if the case falls within your scope of competence.
-
Highlight
do you have the necessary skills, training,
-
Highlight
or experience to effectively treat the issues?
-
Highlight
If not, you need to refer the clients to another therapist who has the appropriate skills or qualifications.
-
Highlight
you may be able to treat clients provided you take appropriate measures during treatment to gain the necessary competence.
-
Highlight
could do a literature review on treating this condition and seek supervision on the case.
-
Highlight
if you are working within an agency setting, you will need to evaluate if the services the clients are seeking fit within the agency‚Äôs scope of practice.
-
Highlight
Some agencies specialize in addressing specific issues or problems, and may not want therapists working with clients who are seeking help for other concerns.
-
Highlight
Seek consultation with your supervisor if these concerns arise, especially if there is any ambiguity around whether the issues fit under the agency‚Äôs scope of practice.
-
Highlight
there may be occasions where your clients‚Äô needs are best met by working on other goals first before addressing the goals with which they initially present.
-
Highlight
You will need to present a rationale to your clients as to why a particular sequence of treatment will ultimately be in their best interest.
-
Highlight
Client goals are often defined in terms of what problems or issues need to be resolved. In contrast, therapist goals generally reflect what changes clients need to make to resolve their problems. Client goals tell the therapist where they want to go, whereas therapist goals describe how the client will get there.
-
Highlight
Many clients not only bring in expectations about what therapy will accomplish, but also about how therapy will be done.
-
Highlight
helpful to assess what clients expect therapy will be like.
-
Highlight
Whenever a client has had previous therapy, it is often beneficial to explore what the experience was like, as it can strongly shape (both positively and negatively) a client‚Äôs expectations regarding therapy.
-
Highlight
What did the client find most useful? What about the process didn‚Äôt work for him or her? More specific questions will generate a clearer picture of what occurred and how you might apply it to the current therapy situation.
-
Highlight
the therapist may need to educate clients about the therapy process
-
Highlight
Clients may hold expectations about therapy in a number of different areas.
-
Highlight
You need to assess if their expectations align with what you think is realistic.
-
Highlight
Clients can also have expectations about who will be in therapy.
-
Highlight
It is also important that the therapist and client share similar views on the purpose of therapy.
-
Highlight
If the therapist and client are not on the same page in this regard, then problems are likely to arise.
-
Highlight
The therapist and client will need to discuss what therapy is about and hopefully reach a mutually agreed-upon understanding.
-
Highlight
It is also possible that other client expectations may impede the therapeutic process.
-
Highlight
In some instances, you may decide against continuing therapy because the expectations are too restrictive and would severely limit your ability to be effective.
-
Highlight
Clients come to therapy with varying degrees of motivation.
-
Highlight
The initial interview is a good time to assess and perhaps begin to build motivation for therapy.
-
Highlight
A logical time to assess motivation is when you are defining goals for therapy. Answers to the question ‚ÄúWhat brings you to therapy?‚Äù will differentiate motivated from unmotivated clients.
-
Highlight
some of these clients can become quite committed to therapy as they experience its benefits.
-
Highlight
You should also inquire as to who first suggested therapy or called for the appointment. Generally this person is the most motivated for therapy. A good question to ask your clients is what led them to come
-
Highlight
to therapy now, rather than sooner or later in their lives?
-
Highlight
Where clients are on the Stages of Change Cycle
-
Highlight
may determine their motivation for change. This cycle recognizes that clients spend a great deal of time (precontemplation and contemplation stages) thinking about changing before they decide to take action and change. In addition, the cycle recognizes that maintaining changes,
-
Highlight
can be challenging. Thus, addressing relapse is part of the process leading to permanent change. The therapist must match his or her interventions to where the client is in terms of their stage of change.
-
Highlight
Motivational interviewing
-
Highlight
suggests that the therapist‚Äôs job is to help the client resolve his or her ambivalence about change. Instead of using confrontation, the empathic therapist validates the client‚Äôs perspective and freedom to decide.
-
Highlight
Pain around unmet needs often drives clients to change.
-
Highlight
it is important that you are clear on what the unmet needs are for your clients, and how much pain or distress they experience around these unmet needs
-
Highlight
You will need to figure out why the client is minimizing the problem, which will guide how you approach the situation.
-
Highlight
it can helpful to explore with clients why others believe there is a problem and the possible negative consequences of not addressing it.
-
Highlight
Sometimes clients will deny that a problem exists out of fear of consequences or injury to their self-image.
-
Highlight
Therefore, building motivation for therapy will need to be done in conjunction with addressing the client‚Äôs denial
-
Highlight
If a mandated client refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists, you can suggest that there is at least one problem‚Äîhe or she is being told to come to unwanted therapy. If your client agrees (which is typically the case), then you can explore what needs to happen so that the client is no longer required to come to therapy. This approach allows you to join with your client, while at the same time working on intermediate goals that address the problem.
-
Highlight
Some clients may have poor motivation because they do not anticipate any benefit from therapy, believing that therapy is useless or the situation is hopeless.
-
Highlight
Building a positive expectation that therapy can be helpful will be vital for these clients
-
Highlight
For clients who lack confidence in their ability to change, you may need to highlight their strengths or help them challenge their negative self-talk. Noting exceptions to the problem might help build confidence and motivation.
-
Highlight
Using the above strategies does not guarantee client motivation.
-
Highlight
In these situations, you need to become comfortable with using the leverage for change provided by the courts.
-
Highlight
A common struggle that beginning therapists may face is when they are more motivated than their clients.
-
Highlight
This dynamic suggests that the therapist needs to step back, review the reasons for therapy, and once again evaluate the clients‚Äô motivation.
-
Highlight
At times, clients might seem motivated ‚Äúfor the wrong reasons.‚Äù
-
Highlight
You don‚Äôt need to agree with the clients‚Äô motivations. Usually, it is enough that clients, for whatever reason, will face the demanding process of change.
-
Highlight
key issue that the beginning therapist must frequently deal with in the initial session: the issue of credibility.
-
Highlight
In order for clients to have hope or an expectation of change, they must see the therapist and therapy as credible, or they may prematurely terminate therapy.
-
Highlight
assess early on if any issues of credibility need to be addressed.
-
Highlight
do the clients see therapy as an effective way to solve problems?
-
Highlight
do the clients see you, in your role as the therapist, as being competent or credible?
-
Highlight
If you suspect there is a credibility problem, you should attempt to pinpoint where and why credibility is lacking.
-
Highlight
The more precise your understanding of why the client does not see you or the therapy as credible, the more likely your intervention will be ‚Äúon target‚Äù in addressing this issue.
-
Highlight
In cases where clients are resistant to therapy in general, you may be able to reframe the process in a way that builds its credibility.
-
Highlight
you must work to reduce the stigma. You can compare therapy to coaching, in that even the best athletes,
-
Highlight
use coaches.
-
Highlight
When clients question a therapist‚Äôs credibility, they usually focus on the lack of professional or life experience. Often you can redefine for the client what type of experience is needed to be helpful.
-
Highlight
If you are concerned about your age and lack of experience, it may also be helpful to dress professionally and present in a professional manner.
-
Highlight
you may need to directly address with your clients how you will compensate for your lack of experience with a particular problem or population.
-
Highlight
you might express your willingness to learn from them about their culture.
-
Highlight
While some clients are open to this approach, others will feel it is not their responsibility to educate the therapist about their culture.
-
Highlight
Especially for these clients, it will be important for you to take the initiative to educate yourself through reading the literature.
-
Highlight
If clients still harbor doubts, a frequently effective strategy is to contract with them for a set number of sessions (perhaps three). This gives you time to demonstrate your competence.
-
Highlight
Nearly all clients are willing to give you this chance, provided the number of sessions is reasonable.
-
Highlight
In these situations, you need to identify a problem that can be quickly resolved to build credibility with your clients.
-
Highlight
It is important that you not become defensive if your credibility is being questioned. If you can deal with your clients‚Äô concerns in a nondefensive and respectful manner, this may actually build your credibility.
-
Highlight
you must be clear in your own mind what you do have to offer, even if you have limited clinical or life experience
-
Highlight
you need to recognize that clients value having someone compassionately and respectfully listen to their story at a difficult time in their lives.
-
Highlight
In simply being present with another human being, you have something important to offer your clients.
-
Highlight
you can frequently offer important insights to your clients because you do not have the kind of emotional involvement in the situation that they do.
-
Highlight
even the inexperienced therapist has access to clinical knowledge that most clients do not possess or could not easily access.
-
Highlight
initial interview is a critical time
-
Highlight
Developing a connection and establishing credibility with your clients is essential for their return for a second session. Defining goals and expectations for therapy, building motivation, and properly handling administrative issues are also crucial.
-
Highlight
You need to remain connected or joined with your clients in order to effectively confront and challenge them at all stages. Likewise, the goals or expectations for therapy may need to be revisited and redefined as therapy proceeds.

Ackerman sought out to understand a family to diagnose problems and develop family treatment. He was a child psychiatrist. He worked at the Menninger Clinic. In 1937, he became the chief psychiatrist of the Child Guidance Clinic. He followed the child guidance model of psychiatry to treat the child while the social worker saw the mother. He began having the same therapist see both the mother and child around the 1940 s. he began to see the family as the basic unit of treatment. In 1955, Ackerman organized the first session on family diagnosis at the Meeting of American Orthopsychiatric Association. <a data-href="Don Jackson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Don Jackson</a>, <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a>, <a data-href="Lyman Wynne (1954)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/lyman-wynne-(1954).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lyman Wynne (1954)</a>, and <a data-href="Nathan Ackerman" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/nathan-ackerman.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nathan Ackerman</a> learned about each others' work and joined in a common practice. The Family Institute was founded in 1960. They renamed the Family Institute to Ackerman Institute following his death in 1971. He believed, even though families may give the appearance of unity, underneath they are split into competing factors. <br>His ideas were similar to the <a data-href="Psychoanalytic Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Psychoanalytic Family Therapy</a> model
Despite the apparent unit of personality, families are actually minds in conflict driven by warring drives and defenses. He believed families confront some issues while avoiding others, such as conflicts involving sex and aggression. He saw his job as bringing the family secrets into the open. He was unrestrained to encourage families to relax their emotional restraint. He first sided with one member of the family and later with another. He believed balance was achieved in the long-run by moving back and forth in giving support now to one, later to another family member. He was described as unabashingly blunt. He stated people get more reassurance from honesty than from false promises. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/nathan-ackerman.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/People in CFT/Nathan Ackerman.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:26:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Multiple Impact Therapy (1967)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see? Discuss how you interpreted the behaviors you heard and saw. Meanings often connect back to past experience. What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make? This helps identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. Similar to EXPRESS in the DESC Model What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? This asks whether you can accept or tolerate your feelings. If a person is not accepting, communication stances will be triggered. Similar to EXPRESS in the DESC Model What DEFENSES do I use? During communication, we may use one of the five communication stances to respond to interaction with others. Below are the four survival stances. Placator

This is a 'yes man' who talks as though they could do nothing for themselves; they must always get someone's approval. They may experience feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit during conflict or disagreement. You may think of yourself as really worth nothing. You are lucky just to be allowed to eat. You owe everybody gratitude, and you really are responsible for everything that goes wrong. Naturally, you will agree with any criticism of you. You are grateful that anyone even talks to you, no matter what they say or how they say it. You would not think of asking anything for yourself. After all, who are you to ask? Besides, if you can just be good enough, it will come by itself. Think of yourself as being physically down on one knee, wobbling a bit, and putting out one hand in a begging fashion. Keep your head up so your neck will hurt, your eyes will strain, and in no time at all your head will ache. When you talk in this position, your voice Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. Acknowledge Other/Context Minimizes self (sometimes context)
People-pleasing tendencies Therapeutic Implications: Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs
Assertiveness/clear communication of needs
Less directive therapy methods
Multiple choice options to practice sense of agency Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Key Terms and Concepts/Placating (Placator).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 16:39:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/placator-stance-diagram.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/placator-stance-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family Systems Theory]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia Emphasized theory
Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother‚Äì child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother‚Äìchild symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).
<br>Beginning in 1955, when Bowen started bringing family members together to discuss their problems, he was struck by their <a data-href="Emotional Reactivity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-reactivity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Reactivity</a>.

The ability to remain neutral and focus on the process, rather than content, of family discussions is what distinguishes a therapist from a participant in a family‚Äôs drama.
To control the level of emotion, Bowen encouraged family members to talk to him, not to each other

Bowen, the oldest of five children from a tightly knit rural family, kept his distance from his parents and the rest of his extended family. Like many of us, he mistook avoidance for emancipation.

Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave. Experience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. Problems affect people
Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. Hence, letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams The truth of experience is not discovered, it is created!
Narrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narrative of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new futures. People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-storied aspects of their lives and relationships. Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. Holds a position of curiosity
Cherishes each person/family's unique stories. Invites clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives. Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. Therapist influential, but decentered
Person separate from problem
All problems have exceptions
Opposite of problem is preferred
Preferred story woven into identity
Impact of relationships explored
Deconstruct societal norms
Personal decision-making supported Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. The problem is the problem.
Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family.
<br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a> There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (re-examining) established truths that oppress people's lives. People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems)
People are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. People are not their problems. People can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. Reject categorizing people
In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves with clients. They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis)
Want to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relations. When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relationship to it. Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict.
Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Problems may be regarded as alien invaders. Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)
Open space for new and more constructive views of themselves.
Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy. Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions. <br><a data-href="Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience. Effects Questions (elicit effects of the problem) How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationships?
Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots. Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multi-stories lives. Once people notice how their stories are problem-saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
Then, the therapists asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
Meetings are typically 60 minutes.
Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between). CAUTION: Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories. Instead: Narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories. Counterstory Asking Permission is central to the model. At the start of 1 st meeting, the therapist asks if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy. Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from previous session aloud and asking a question, such as: "Can you tell me about any new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time?" Other times the therapist begins wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations. Therapist use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session. Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem. Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keep a story alive and growing. Collaborative
Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem. Takes notes of what works and what doesn't. Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation.
Therapy is a relationship - a conversation!
Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories. Open space for describing alternatives. Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently. Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments. The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders. Therapists have more questions than answers! It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.
The therapist invites family members to: Evaluate their current situation
Name the problems involved
Evaluate their relationship to those problems
Take a stand in regard to them
Tell more satisfying stories of their lives
Evaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. Private hopes and fears
Family interactions
Contributions of culture of origin
Traditions, legacies Questioning Is that the problem speaking?
Whose values are guiding you in saying that? By exposing discourses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?

Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve. Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice
More qualitative research rather than quantitative studies
Little empirical support currently exists
Randomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist Listen to stories as stories
Be attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story
Ask about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationships
Make sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem'
Unless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences
At some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories
Try to put yourself in their shoes
Do not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them
Listen and ask
Listen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust Listen 'deconstructively' to family's stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings
As families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning
We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'? Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society
Develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work in the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult
There are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play
Deconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that support them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem
Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people
As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families
If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
Who benefits from the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it
As we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem
What are the family's preferred directions?
Counterplot / counter-story
'Standing against' the problem Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
Is the problem always with you? Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives
Double listening
If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled
If a person experiences injustice, they must have a conception of a just world
When we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications Stories need listeners as well as tellers
Attentive witnesses
The therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful
What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive
We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop
We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud
We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems
We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions
In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session
Out intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session
We may invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict... Narrative therapy aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. <br>Reality is socially constructed. (<a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>)
Reality is influenced by and communicated through language. Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality. There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. Telling One's Story A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. Externalization Technique Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. Deconstruction Technique This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. Unique Outcomes Technique To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that does not include your most pervasive problems. Existentialism The belief that the world holds no inherent meaning, and that we all must make our own meaning in life. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dulwichcentre.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dulwichcentre.com.au/" target="_self">https://dulwichcentre.com.au</a>

Rating/Scaling (1 to 10)
Break
After intermission, the therapist will give the client/family compliments, sometimes followed by a suggestion or homework. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Once you know what works, do more of it. If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).
Focus is on solutions, on what works for clients. Respect clients own resources. Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. Future-oriented
Focusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).
The task of therapy is to do something different. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen? The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'
Solution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. What brings you in?
What are your best hopes for this meeting? Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. Changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. Problem talk: Negative
Focuses on the past
Implies permanence of problems. Clients are experts in their own lives. Clients know what they need Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?
The therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. People are resourceful. Problems are normal life-cycle complications. Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. What will you be doing instead? The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems ‚Äì effective solutions already in their repertoire.
Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.
As the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.
It is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.
Getting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.
Change perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. They begin living in the solution, not the problem. The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. Time limited
Sessions are made one at a time
One may be enough
Typical course includes 3-5 sessions
Clients can return as-needed
Often a week to a few weeks apart
Once you know more of what works, do more of it Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. What do you think the problem is now?
How will you know when the problem is solved?
How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). Asks more about perceptions than feelings. Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.
Consultant
Guardian of the conversation
Don't get bogged down in 'problem talk'
Focus on what is right
Direct clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. Focus on the 'here and now'
The future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. Assumes a position of 'not knowing.' What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
Constructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the client to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represented the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone. So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Developing well-focused goals within the clients' frame of reference
Generating solutions based on exceptions Goal setting

Asking for clients' perceptions
Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. How do we know when to stop meeting like this?
Goals should be: Small
Salient to clients
Concrete, behavioral, measurable
Achieveable
Involve hard work
Start of something
Involving new behaviors What will be present? What will be happening?
After hearing and acknowledging the clients' description of the problem and what they've tried to do about them, next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. Specifically, how will you be doing this?
How will the two of you know when you solved your problems? How will things be different?
What will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else? The clearer the goal, the easier to measure progress. Can you tell me more specifically what will be happening when you two are getting along better?
What will you be doing differently? Modest enough to be achievable. Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened?
Invite clients to envision positive outcomes and to activate problem-solving by giving them a mental picture of their goals. Helps clients to look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do things that the problem has been obstructing. Suppose one night there is a miracle and while you are sleeping the problem that brought you into therapy is solved. How would you know?
What would be different?
What will you notice the next morning that will tell you there has been a miracle?
What will your [family member] notice? Helping families see that their problems have exceptions - times when they don't occur. Exceptions are solutions that families already have in their repertoire. Probing for exceptions (e.g., times when the family didn't have the problem) invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. Finding exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail; also since these exceptions just happened, it is more plausible they could happen again. When in the recent past might the problem have happened but didn't (or was less intense or more manageable)?
What's different about those times when the problem doesn't happen?
How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you? How did you manage that?
What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?
How come things aren't worse?
Punctuate with enthusiasm and support
Work to keep solution talk in the forefront. Listen carefully for an exception to the problem, then punctuate that exception by getting more details about it and congratualating the family on it. Connect the exception to the family's goals by asking how the goal would be reached if this exception were to occur more often. The therapist asks: On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now? "It is a 2."
"So, you feel a little better than when you called. How did you achieve this improvement?"
"What do you think you need to do to achieve a 3?" Used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you will be able to avoid losing your temper this week?
What do you have to do to stick to your guns this time? Wow! How did you do that?
To be effective, compliments should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work Team approach with therapist in session and colleagues behind the mirror. Therapist usually takes a 10 minute break near the end of the session to compose a summary message to the clients. The summary messages begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the client's goals, and presession progress and strengths. What I heard you tell me today is that... Did I hear all of you correctly? A statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy. "I'm not surprised you are so depressed." A reflection of the emotional impact on the client. "My sense is that you must really be hurting." Compliments on pre-session changes or strengths "I was impressed by how many things you've tried to make things better." Some content on the client's goals
Suggestions for building on positives Formula first-session task
Do more of what works
Do something different
Go slow
Do the opposite
The prediction task Devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress
Inquire about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the clients' role in attaining it. What's better?
What happened that you liked?
Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that. Wow. That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?
And what else is better? What do you think the next step might be?
How did you keep things from getting worse?
What's your idea about what might be helpful? Sometimes the model is portrayed as an approach that does not permit discussion of the problem, but this is not accurate. When done skillfully, families do not feel rushed. Emotion is not avoided, but it is also not sought or elicited. Therapist is present as a real, genuinely concerned person, but does not engage in unneeded personal self-disclosure. How can we know when to stop meeting like this?
What needs to be different in your life as a result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?
If you wait till all of the family's problems are solved, you will never stop seeing them. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/5.-solution-focused-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/5.

In many contexts, the term 'couple' has replaced 'marriage' because of its emphasis on the bond between family members/individuals. This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage). Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)
With respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).
While the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible). Psychiatrists are physicians whoo specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health and emotional problems. (M.D. needed)
Psychologist study the human mind and behavior. (Masters needed)
Social Workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve problems. (Bachelors degree needed, unless clinical social work which needs a masters level degree)
Counselors assist people with personal, family, educational, mental health, and career decisions and problems. (Masters needed)

Inter Social Work Case management A family's patterns of behaviors influences the individual and therefore may need to be a part of the treatment plan. In CFT, the unit of treatment isn't just the person - even if only one person is 'the client'; it is the set of relationships in which the person is embedded.

MFTs treat a wide range of serious clinical problems including: Depression
Relationship issues
Anxiety
Biopsychosocial-rooted problems Research has shown that CFT is as effective or more effective than standard individual treatments for many mental health problems including: Schizophrenia
Affective Mood Disorder
Substance (Ab)use
Child Conduct Disorder
Anorexia
Autism
Chronic Illness
Couple/Partner Distress Psychiatry raised concern about scope of practice Wanted to keep MFTs from diagnosis Psychology sought amendments to the scope to place restrictions on psychological testing, and some oppose licensure in general. Social Work concerned with title restriction Wanted to call its members MFTs Counselors (ACA) historically most active opponents Opposed MFT licensure all together
Labeled the discipline as a subspecialty of counseling Professionals from many different disciplines may at times utilize family-based interventions, or work from theories or models that are core to the CFT discipline. Does that mean they are CFTs? Profession vs. Practice AAMFT's response 'It's not our intent to define the standards or the scope of practice of any other discipline - social work or psychology, for example, by saying what services they can perform or what training is need to perform those series. "We assume those professions will be diligent in ensuring that their practitioners will only deliver services for which they have had training, and are competent to perform, and that the regulatory boards for those professions will police those who go beyond their competence."

No family style is inherently normal or abnormal. Whether organizational patterns are functional or dysfunctional depends largely on their fit with the family's developmental and social demands.
The strength of the system requires clear yet flexible boundaries and subsystems for the ability to shift organizational patterns to accommodate needed change. <br><a data-href="Experiential Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Experiential Family Therapy</a> <br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a>

Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son. Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. Family members have a long history and a future together. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).
We need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems. Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts) For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

The goal of therapy shifted from interrupting problematic patterns of interaction to helping clients find new perspective on their lives. When they said reality was constructed, they meant socially constructed. Interpretations are shaped by our context. Interpretation of our experience mediates behavior. Social constructionists place more emphasis on the intersubjective influence of language and culture. Therapy becomes a process of deconstruction, freeing clients from the tyranny of entrenched beliefs. Inherent in most forms of therapy is the idea that before you can solve a problem, you must figure out what is wrong. But solution-focused turns this assumption on its head. The best way to solve problems is to discover what people do when they are not having the problem. Exceptions to a complaint.

The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. Structure became the target of change. Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems. Then, therapists aimed their interventions at those underlying beliefs. More recently, it dawned on therapists that those belief systems do not arise in a vacuum Behavior is shaped by transactions we don't always see.

Process/Content Focus on the process of communication (how people talk), rather than the context (what they talk about) The goal is to get an overview of the presenting problem and arrange to meet. Listen to the description of the problem and identify all members of the family, household, and others who might be involved. Establish connection and engagement. Ask how the problem is affecting other members of the family. You'd like to hear from everyone, at least initially, in order to get as much information as possible. Reminder calls help increase likelihood of attendance. Build alliance with the family. Develop hypothesis about what is maintaining the presenting problem.
Establish rapport.
Gather information.
Introduce yourself.
Orient the family to the therapy room (physical or virtual) and the format of sessions. Invite family members to speak one at a time. Give everyone a chance to be heard.

What were your reactions to coming in? Take a family history. Conduct the genogram to diagram the family network. Listen for family life cycle transitions. Search for strengths and resilience. Remain curious and respectful. Explore the process of family interaction by asking questions about how family members relate to one another and inviting them to discuss their problems with one another in session. What is keeping the family stuck?
Share recommendations for treatment. What is maintaining the problem?
Maintain therapeutic alliance. Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?
Challenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. Listen to people's feelings. Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. Step back and observe. When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. Stay calm: You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. Be curious. Display empathy and respect. Review the therapeutic relationship. Say goodbye. Reinforce progress. Review what the family has accomplished. Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges.

Assess for substance use, IPV, and affairs. Consider assessment tools if needed.
Be aware of mandated reporting. General Practitioner What is your scope of practice? Specialist Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems? Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. All behavior makes sense in context. No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. Family therapists work to see the big picture. Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. Share the following assumptions: A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. Systems theory Systems metaphor
A family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. Social constructionist Textual metaphor
People narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. Skeptical of objective reality.
Reality is constructed. Reality is constructed through language. Reality is negotiated through relationships. Shared meanings coordinate social action. Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. Therapist assumes expert role. Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. Humans are essentially good. All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).
A supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. <br>Examples such as <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication.

No one individual controls behavior in a system and therefore no one individual can be blamed for problems in the family. Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).
If the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers. Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. Deficits in communication and problem solving. High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members) Behavior is maintained by its consequences. Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)
Good relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)
Emotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)
Understand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.
Uncovering hidden/automatic assumptions that keep people stuck. Overgeneralizations
Magnification and minimization
Personalization
Dichotomous thinking
Labeling and mislabeling
Also called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of
The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. This agenda of therapy is educational: Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Identify behavioral goals
Learn techniques to achieve these goals
Facilitate social reinforcement of change Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)
Use of homework assignments
Phase out therapy gradually. Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. Booster sessions Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems: All couples run into conflict. Conflict resolution is a critical skill. Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. Families need problem solving skills Therapy includes: Clinical interview
Rating specific behaviors
Relationship satisfaction questionnaires Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making. Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Imagery
Role-play
Coaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)

Once assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased or decreased. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing approximate behaviors. Ignoring
Rewards Identifying Automatic Thoughts Assist family members in identifying automatic thoughts
To improve the skills of identifying automatic thoughts, clients are encouraged to keep a diary to jot down situations that provoke the thoughts and the resulting emotional reactions. Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. Do not be triangulated! CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'
Blocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary Inclusion of other individuals if necessary
Medication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT
Co-therapy model is allowed
Both individual and conjoint sessions are allowed. Clients may be more likely to divulge information about their past in private sessions. CBFT therapists tell clients they will keep this information confidential, but if it might be influencing the family's current interactions, they encourage the person to share it in a joint session

Information gathering: Self-report questionnaires, clinical interviews, observation of interactional patterns Initial conjoint interviews: How the couple met, what attracted them to each other, how they developed a deeper involvement, positive and negative life events, prior experiences in therapy. Inquires about the family members' current concerns and strengths of the relationship. Orients the family to the process of therapy by describing the structure and course of CBFT and the roles of therapist and family. Increasing the frequency and magnitude and positive behaviors

"Work together with the family to develop a series of agreements on how they want to make changes in their relationships to meet the needs of the family members, to help their relationship function effectively, and to interact positively with their environment." (Gurman et al., 2015, p. 36) For sharing thoughts and emotions (p.38)
For listening (p. 38)
For decision-making conversations (p. 38)
"The therapist provides the family with instruction in the use of particular behavioral skills, through didactic discussions and/or other media (e.g., readings, videos). The instruction is followed by opportunities for the family to practice behaving in the new ways." Selective Attention What each person notices about the partner and the relationship Attributions Inferences about determinants of relationship events Expectancies Predictions of what will occur in the relationship in the future Assumptions What each person believes people and relationships actually are like Standards What each person believes people and relationships should look like Socratic Questioning Understanding the underlying issues through evaluations of the logic of thinking Guided Discovery Clarify each person's standards. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of existing standards. If standards need alteration, help revise them to form new acceptable standards.

Use questions, reflections, and interpretations to draw out primary emotions
Describe emotions through metaphors and images
Discourage attempts to distract the self from experiencing emotions
Encourage acceptance of the individual's experience by family members For example, asking one family member to recount a particular incident in detail while helping the individual enrich their expression in a way that helps the individual and the family. Schedule times to discuss emotions and related thoughts with your partner/family member

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. <br>The three major concepts of structural family therapy are <a data-href="Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Structure</a>, <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a>, and <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a>s. <br><a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> (Couple; Parent; Sibling) Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers'
Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple
Parental
Child/Sibling Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.
Disengaged systems are independent, but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support. Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.
Enmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness can cripple initiative. Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. "The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system."
Disengaged or enmeshed subsystems
Hierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary
Conflict avoidance Detouring which results in a scapegoat
Cross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted) Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).
Families are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of: Normative life cycle transition The arrival of a first child
An adult child leaving home An acute stressor Natural Disaster
Unemployment Single Adult
Coupling
Having Children
Families with Young Children
Families with School-Age Children
Families with Adolescents
Divorce
Blended Families

Later Life Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. All behavior makes sense in context. The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other. <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> refers to those moments in therapy when family members interact directly with each other. <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> is not necessarily a technique. It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session. Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.
Problems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.
Activate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. Create effective hierarchy: Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).

Take-Away: Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including: Who should attend
How often
Referrals for psychiatric evaluation Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)
Map the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)
Intervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment) Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. Some problems may be treated individually. Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals. Role of the symptoms in the family

Strengths Ask questions about the presenting problem until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family. Assist family members in seeing how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. Briefly explore the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members might take to interact in more productive ways to create a shift in the family structure and help resolve the presenting problem. Greet the family
Ask for each person's view of the problem
Listen carefully
Acknowledge what you hear
Model empathy that family members are temporarily not able to provide
Acknowledgement (feeling heard and understood) releases family members from resentment

When the enactment breaks down: Comment on what went wrong. Push them to keep going. Assess interactions in session. Families tend to quickly induct therapists in their culture. Take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing structure requires focusing on process, not content. Achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. <br>Pay attention to <a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>s Temper tantrums are maintained by parents who give in.

Invite family members to speak for themselves. Block interruptions. Assist dyads in finishing conversations without intrusion. Although structural family therapy begins with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be held with individuals or subgroups to strengthen boundaries. Asking family members to change seats. Asking family members to move seats further apart or closer together or turn toward one another. Having separate sessions with individuals or subsystems to strengthen boundaries. Asking one or more members to remain silent during an interaction. Asking questions that highlight a problem boundary area (e.g., do you always answer for your son when he is asked a question?)
Blocking interruptions or encouraging pauses to enable less dominant persons to speak. The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. While taking sides seems like a violation of neutrality, this is done to unbalance and realign the system (note that fairness is achieved because the therapist sides with family members in turn).

Act as a teacher, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Stroke and a Kick: To mother, "You are very helpful." (Stroke)
To daughter, "Mommy sometimes takes away your voice. Can you speak for yourself?" (Kick) After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)
To formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. Should take into account every member. Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. Should not be explained to the family. As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. Use family's language. Use family's content. Include everyone. Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. Realize that there is no perfect reframe. Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. Blocking: Stopping usual transactions. Exaggerating: Encouraging or sustaining interactions. Silence: When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD) Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions) Therapist must be more flexible than the family. Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).

Describe 'who you are' as a therapist. How will 'who you are' as a therapist impact therapy with families?
What are your personal strengths? What are your growth areas? Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recently, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Similar to all family therapy approaches, structural family therapy is not effective in all cases. No research identifies readily observable characteristics shared by failed cases of structural family therapy. Developed to work with poor urban families, at all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and across countries. Indirect empirical support, as research on efficacy has focused on applicability to family treatment. Studies that directly test structural family therapy's efficacy in the treatment of various presenting problems and targeted populations are needed. Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'
Effectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'
Currently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches. Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'
Insufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)
Effective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models. It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works: Randomized control trials
Case studies data
Observations of therapists and clients Collecting qualitative or quantitative Remember: Research lags behind practice in family therapy. Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. Heteronormative
Pathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)
Family mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/3.-structural-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/3.

If an organization creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a CE, it is considered a business association of the CE.
If you take self-pay only and do not bill insurance, then you might not be a CE, but HIPAA is becoming a standard of care.
State Laws and our Ethics Code are actually more stringent than HIPAA around the confidentiality and privacy of therapy in terms of notes, diagnoses, etc.
When working for a CE, have to provide a Notice of Privacy Practices, a disclosure about what information can be shared and what can‚Äôt be.
Biggest concerns are about electronic medical records and breaches of confidentiality
Use only HIPAA compliant software which encrypts and has lots of safeguards against hackers including back-ups etc.
HITECH compels CE‚Äôs to notify anyone effected by a breach of confidentiality within 60 days of the discovery of the incident with a risk analysis.

Older Adults and Person with Disabilities]]></title><description><![CDATA[
People age 65+ = 16% of the population in 2019 (51.1 million) Expected to be 21.6% by 2040. Nearly 1 in 4 older adults were members of a racial/ethnic minority population: African American (not Hispanic): 12%
Asian American (not Hispanic): 13%
Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (not Hispanic): 10%
American Indian and Alaska Native (not Hispanic): 12%
Hispanic: 8%
Persons identifying as two or more groups: 6% In Ohio persons 65+ represented 17.51% of the population (2,046,320)
This represents a 27.31% increase from 2009-2019. 8.3% of persons 65+ in Ohio live below the poverty line. In 2020, a larger percentage of older men (70%) than older women (48%) were married. Of older adults age 65+ living in the community, 61% lived with their spouse/partner in 2020. About 27% lived alone The 2019 median income of older persons was $27,398 ($36, 921 for men and $21,815 for women)
In 2019, 4.9 million people age 65+ lived below the poverty level. Another 2.6 million were 'near-poor' The median household income of older homeowners was $36,200 in 2019. In 2020, 9.8 million Americans age 65+ were in the labor force (working or actively seeking work). Consumers age 65+ averaged out-of-pocket health care expenditures of $6,833 in 2019, up 41% from 2009. In 2019, about 1.1 million people age 60+ were responsible for the basic needs of at least one grandchild under age 18 living with them. During COVID-19, between March and April 2020, the unemployment rate for adults age 65+ more than quadrupled. Negative stereotypes and discrimination (ageism)
Mental deterioration Some cognitive slowing is associated with normal aging (e.g., periodic minor memory difficulties, such as forgetting names or phone numbers or misplacing objects)
About 1 in 7 adults 71+ have dementia Alzheimer disease Elder abuse and neglect
Substance abuse
Social isolation, depression, and suicidality Please identify the following for Older Adults: Characteristics
Strengths
Ethnic or Cultural Values What emotional stressors are specific to older adults? What are possible ways to support the client in feeling with these emotional stressors? How can we think about care with older adults as suicide prevention?
As clinicians, what can we do to address the physical limitations that an older adult client may face to make sure these challenges do not impede the treatment process? 26% of adults in the US have some types of disability (61 million)
2 in 5 adults age 65 years and older have a disability
1 in 4 women have a disability
2 in 5 non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaskan Natives have a disability
Adults living with disabilities are more likely to be obese, smoke, and have heart disease and diabetes. 1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years do not have a usual health care provider
1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years have an unmet healthcare need because of cost in the past year
1 in 4 adults with disabilities 45 to 64 years did not have a routine check-up in the past year. Over 3 million children (4.3% of the under-18 population) in the US had a disability in 2019. The most common disability type among children both years was cognitive difficulty
American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) children had the highest rate of childhood disability of all racial groups, at 5.9% in 2019. In the moral model (or religious), disability is seen as having meaning about the person's or family's character, deeds, thoughts, and karma. From this perspective, disability can carry stigma, shame and blame, particularly if the disability is seen as a mark of wrongdoing. It can also be seen as a sign of honor, faith, or strength (although this is less common)
The moral model is very prevalent worldwide and is often depicted in the media The Medical model views disability as resulting from an individual person's physical or mental limitations
The Medical Model focuses on find a 'cure' or making a person more 'normal'
The Medical Model uses the terms 'Disability,' 'Disease,' 'Dysfunctional,' 'Disorder' to categorize type of symptoms, differences in mechanisms, below average based on standardized measure of functioning, that causes challenges in life. ‚ÄúPasted image 20240410205740.jpg‚Äù could not be found. This model 'proposes that what makes someone disabled is not their medical condition, but the attitudes and structures of society. It is a civil rights approach to disability.'

People with disability have the same rights as everyone else in society," and disability, "must not be used as an excuse to deny or restrict people's rights" Using both models, we can begin to see people with disabilities correctly: as human. We must consider how we can become better allies for individuals with disabilities by ensuring that society is accessible (Social Model)
We must examine how we interact with and view people with disabilities.. We must ensure that our policies and practices support the Human Rights Model and encourage full inclusion and participation for individuals with disabilities

Given by caregiver, answers questions about person's mood or belief system. Starts by interviewing Is the caregiver noticing behavioral disturbances? Are they noticing physical signs? Changes to cyclical behaviors? Discuss with caregiver concerns of possible depression, "I'm concerned you may be experiencing depression, let's find a provider that specializes in working with older adults." How to start conversation when concerned Start conversation in calm, straight-forward, compassionate way
Describe what you observed
Can I help you connect with people who can help? Due to added caregiving responsibilities that are necessary for individuals with disabilities, members of families affected by disabilities have an increased prevalence of physical, psychological, and relational distress. Parents, spouses, and siblings of children with disabilities experience higher rates of mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression. Caregivers have higher rates of health problems and reports a variety of physical symptoms such as migraines, heart conditions, and sleep problems. The mental and physical health effects lead to reports of decreased quality of life and general wellbeing. Many of the adverse physical, mental, and relational health effects described by family members of individuals with disabilities are compounded by a lack of social support. Families often explain that there is a notable deficit in available social support, which they generally attribute to two main reasons: Family members‚Äô lack of free time to socialize with friends and family due to the added caregiving responsibilities
Societal stigma associated with disabilities that may be attributed to personal shame and embarrassment of family members or the disapproval and ostracization by others Clinicians working with families affected by disabilities can support caregivers by connecting them with appropriate online platforms to increase social support, which acts as a protective factor against the harmful effects of caregiver stress and burnout. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/3.-cft-with-specific-populations/14.-older-adults-and-person-with-disabilities.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/3.

Requires us to acknowledge positions of privilege and marginalization in the room. Potential Barriers: In general, therapists are less religious than their clients and the population at large. There is a historic divide between science (psychology) and religion
In the United States there is a desire to maintain separation between church and state
Some therapists avoid the topic to avoid imposing their own beliefs
Some therapists lack confidence in how to address religion and spirituality ethically and effectively. An organized system of beliefs, rituals, practices, and community, oriented toward the sacred. Tends to focus on formal organizations with specifically defined and widely accepted beliefs, practices, and traditions. Transcendent beliefs and practices lived out in daily life and relationships. It can be experienced outside religious structure. "A process through which people seek to discover, hold on to, and when necessary, transform whatever they hold sacred in their lives." Spiritually integrated psychotherapy is based on findings in psychotherapy research and the psychology of religion. It is the practice of purposefully assessing clients' spiritual/religious belief systems and worldviews in the context of psychotherapy, while integrating spiritually oriented interventions. Clinical
Spiritual
Moral Any inquiry about topics commonly related to spiritual themes (i.e., meaning making, coping, social support, and morality) Explore client's worldview and/or personal philosophies
Listen for client's use of 'spiritually laden' words
Explore client's current experience of congruence Acknowledge client's spontaneous statements of spiritual beliefs' Inquire about their spiritual beliefs and practices
Inquire about how they connect spiritual, clinical, and moral dimensions of life. Express agreement with the client's spiritual beliefs or sensibilities when such self-disclosure could be therapeutic. Articulate client's dilemma without giving your own position. Point out contradictions between the client's beliefs and clinical realities or moral issues. Challenge the client's way of handling spiritual beliefs based on your own spiritual, moral, or clinical beliefs. Any method of direct inquiry about a client's spirituality or religion. The purpose of spiritual reflection is twofold: Understand ourselves in our work with clients
Understand clients from their own point-of-view Increasing our understanding helps us fulfill the role of spiritually integrated therapists by not placing our beliefs and/or bias onto the client. Questions to consider: How are these clients encountering a search for meaning?
How do these clients and their presenting problem represent a theme from religious tradition or spiritual worldview (e.g., hope, reconciliation, pillars of faith)
Regarding this case, what is an experience of the sacred/divine/spirit? Spirituality and religion as distinctive concepts
Ethical implications of integration religion and spirituality in practice
Start with a strong understanding of one's own social location

In other words, it refers to people who lived there before colonists or settlers arrived, defined new borders, and began to occupy the land. The term 'indigeneity' has emerged to describe the state of being indigenous or related to Indigenous-ness. There are over 476 million indigenous people living in 90 countries across the world, accounting for 6.2% of the global population: Of those, there are more than 5,000 distinct groups. Healing-informed care is care based on Indigenous wisdom about wellness and what is necessary to heal. Balance
Relational
Strength-based Healing has been defined as 'transition toward meaning, wholeness, connectedness, and balance.' Holistic: Interconnectedness underlies all of human experience Balance: Because of the interdependencies of all life, achieving and maintaining balance is important both to the individual and the larger group. Moral Code: The physical and metaphysical worlds are linked to a moral code.

Bibliography:
Type: Book
Title: Counseling the culturally diverse: theory and practice, Author: Sue, Derald Wing; Sue, David; Neville, Helen A.; Smith, Laura; Publisher: Wiley,
Location: Hoboken, NJ,
Year: 2022 ISBN: 978-1-119-86190-4
"For over four decades, Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice (CCD) has been considered the "gold standard" in culturally competent mental health care. Its cutting-edge presentation of multicultural counseling and therapy (MCT) is used in an overwhelming majority of graduate training programs in counseling and clinical psychology, and it has produced generations of culturally sensitive mental health practitioners. It now forms the multicultural knowledge base of licensing and certification exams at both the masters and the doctoral levels in psychology. In 2021, Social Science Space identified the book as one of the most important works across social science disciplines that has contributed to the ongoing need to understand, analyze, resist, and dismantle racism, bias, and bigotry. In essence, CCD has become a "classic" in the field of mental health practice, and leads the profession in the theory, research, and practice of MCT. CCD upholds the highest standards of scholarship, and is the most frequently cited source in multicultural psychology and mental health. The expert and global perspectives of the four co-authors, each active researchers and practitioners in the field, strengthen the newly minted ninth edition of CCD. As a result, instructors will note the continued fresh, scholarly, and exciting perspective in the content of CCD, as it continues to rank as the most up-to- date text in the field"--

Restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in functioning (social, academic, occupational) There is not just one cause of ASD
There are many different factors that have been identified that may make a child more likely to have ASD, including environmental, biologic, and genetic factors. Although we know little about specific causes, the available evidence suggests that the following may put children at greater risk for developing ASD: Having a sibling with ASD
Having certain genetic or chromosomal conditions, such as fragile X syndrome or tuberous scierosis
Experiencing complications at birth
Being born older parents Developmental monitoring (collecting or gathering information) and screening (testing). Surveillance or developmental monitoring is an active ongoing process of watching a child grow and encouraging conversations between parents and providers about a child's skills and abilities. CDC's Learn the Signs Act Early program has developed free materials, including CDC's Milestone Tracker app, to help parents and prociders work together to monitor children's development and know when there might be a concern and if more screening is needed. Screening is when a parent or provider completes a checklist or questionnaire specifically designed to identify problems that need further evaluation. General developmental screening should occur at the 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well child visits and whenever a concern is expressed. Autism-specific screening should additionally occur at the 18- and 24- or 30-month visits and whenever a concern is expressed. 1% of the population
Unclear whether higher rates reflect expansion of diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, or true increase. Intervention and support may mask difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the severity of the condition, developmental level, and chronological age; hence the term spectrum. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple sources of information: clinical observations, caregiver history, self-report (when possible) 'Red Flags' for autism. Do not use this language when discussing symptomatology. DSM-5 perpetuated that "only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work independently in adulthood; those who tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills."
DSM-5-TR: While it was once the case that only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder lived and worked independently in adulthood, as diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made more frequently in those who have superior language and intellectual abilities, more individuals are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills and thus are productively employed. Access to vocational rehabilitation services significantly improves competitive employment outcomes for transition-age youth with autism spectrum disorder. In general, individuals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently. 1 in 11 children

Major Depressive Disorder
Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, it is estimated that 5-10% of adults suffer from depression. Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. More women are affected by depression than men. Depression can lead to suicide. There is effective treatment for mild, moderate, and severe depression. History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs. Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain, or heart disease. Certain medications, such as high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills. Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence
Neglect
Abuse or poverty May make some people more vulnerable to depression Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical, or pessimistic. People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression. Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression. Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems. Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide. Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70% chance of having the illness sometime in life. 5+ symptoms during the same 2-week period

Family systems theories provide us with a framework for understanding individuals within context. Depression is an interaction of a family member's inner experiences and various outer systems affective the individual within the family. Relational and cultural factors influence depression.

Bipolar and Related Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[
The main thing to remember about the difference between Bipolar I and II, Mania is more problematic and have more disturbing behavior. Impulsive spending, gambling, and sex. May put themselves in risky situations (involving money, sex, drugs), some may be hyperfocused. Full blown mania usually have serious consequences. Some part of their life was profoundly impacted. Think about the time part. Severe because it can lead to serious consequences. How long did it last. Bipolar I and II is not a difference. Is it lasting for a long period of time or a short period of time? It is a common misperception that children cannot have bipolar disorder. Although most people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood, the symptoms can appear earlier in childhood. In children, happiness, silliness, and ‚Äúgoofiness‚Äù are normal in many social contexts; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet the Criterion A mood requirement of abnormally elevated mood. For the happiness or silliness of a child to meet Criterion A, it must be distinctly increased from the child‚Äôs baseline and accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that to those who know the child well are clearly unusual for that child. For a child‚Äôs symptoms to meet criteria for a manic episode, the symptoms must also meet Criterion B for mania and must also represent a change from the child‚Äôs usual baseline.
In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the child‚Äôs normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.
The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child‚Äôs baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal association with other symptoms of mania.
The peak age at onset of bipolar I disorder across studies is between 20 and 30 years, but onset occurs throughout the life cycle. Special considerations are necessary to apply the diagnosis in children. Because children of the same chronological age may be at different developmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúexpected‚Äù at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her own baseline in determining whether a particular behavior is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or evidence of a manic episode. Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier than for major depressive disorder. Age at onset does not reliably distinguish between bipolar I and II disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode. Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter. The vast majority of youth with cyclothymic disorder experience the onset of mood symptoms before age 10. Bipolar I Disorder
Bipolar II Disorder
Cyclothymic Disorder Bipolar I disorder is a manic-depressive disorder that can exist both with and without psychotic episodes. Bipolar II disorder consists of depressive and manic episodes which alternate and are typically less severe and do not inhibit function. Cyclothymic disorder is a cyclic disorder that causes brief episodes of hypomania and depression. Bipolar I (Mania)
Bipolar II (Hypomania) Lasts at least one week, or any length if hospitalized due to mania Abnormal and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy. During Criterion A symptoms, three or more of these symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity
Decrease in need for sleep
More talkative than baseline or fast talking
Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
Distractibility (reported or seen)
Increase in goal-oriented activity (especially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose
Excessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (e.g., unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretion or foolish business investments) Mood disturbance severity Causes marked impairment in social or occupational functioning OR
Requires hospitalization to prevent harm OR
There are psychotic traits Differential diagnosis Substance use and medical causes are ruled out Distinct period that lasts at least four consecutive days and is present most of the day, nearly every day. Abnormally and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy. In context of Criterion A above, three or more of these symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) have persisted and are markedly different from baseline and have been present to a significant degree. Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity
Decrease in need for sleep
More talkative than baseline or fast talking
Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
Distractibility (reported or seen)
Increase in goal-directed activity (socially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose
Excessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions or foolish business investments) Unambigious change in functionining not characteristic of the person when not symptomatic
Mood disturbance and change in function are observable by others
Episode does not cause significant impairment and is not severe enough to require hospitalization If there are psychotic features, it is a manic (not hypomanic) episode. Not attributable to different diagnosis Substance use and medical causes are ruled out Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day
Significant weight loss or gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day
Insomnia or hypersomnia
A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)
Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode. During the above 2 year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time.

Rapid cycling (Removed) Bipolar does not operate solely in an individual, but appears in relationships with disturbing force
The challenges of bipolar are shared with families
Family systems also impact the disorders' course and treatment. How do family members respond to the affected members?
How much support is offered?
How does the family respond to stressors?
How do the larger support systems impact family functioning?
Bipolar affects and is affected by the family system. Treatment is enhanced when family members understand the course and treatment of bipolar, and offer support. Identifying information

DSM-TR is a manual for assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders and does not include information or guidelines for treatment of any disorder. Determining an accurate diagnosis is the first step toward being able to appropriately treat any medical condition, and mental disorders are no exception. DSM-5-TR is helpful in measuring the effectiveness of treatment, as dimensional assessments will assist clinicians in assessing changes in severity levels as a response to treatment. 1840: Category 'insanity' first attempt to quantify and name psychiatric diagnoses. 1844: APA published a predecessor of the DSM: A classification of institutionalized mental patients Early 1900s: First description of schizophrenia by Emil Kraeplin. 1917: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, included 22 diagnoses. 1952: First DSM, 130 pages long, 106 disorders 1994: DSM IV, 886 pages long, 297 disorders 2000: DSM IV-TR, 943 pages long, 365 disorders 2013: DSM 5, 991 pages long, 157 disorders 2022: DSM-5-TR, 1050 pages long A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from dysfunction in the individual, as described above. The DSM is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria which facilitate diagnosis.
It is the standard reference for clinical practice in mental health. Please also be familiar with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-10 Codes) The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continues to evolve.
Too rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... the degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder).
Clinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress. Reliable diagnoses are essential for: Guiding treatment
Identifying prevalence rates
Identifying clients for clinical research
Documenting public health information Standardizes billing and coding
Standardizes diagnoses and treatment
Guides research
Guides treatment Oversimplifies human behavior
Increases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis
Provides labels, which can be stigmatizing Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders.
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation. Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process.
Integrates measures administered at initial interview and over time to track symptom status and response to treatment. A categorical approach to assessment relies on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity. Ask Categorical (Yes/No)
Ask Frequency (How often?)
Ask Intensity/Severity (Rating: mild, moderate, severe)
Ask Duration (How long does it last?) Disorder-specific and correspond closely to the diagnostic criteria. Some are self-completed by the individual, couple, or family. Interpreted by clinician
Shared back with the individual, couple, or family Others require a clinician to complete Categories: Cognition (understanding and communicating)
Mobility (moving and getting around)
Self-Care (hygiene, dressing, eating, and staying alone)
Getting Along (interacting with other people)
Life Activities (domestic responsibilities, leisure, work and school)
Participation (joining in community activities) A generic assessment instrument for health and disability
Used across all diseases, including mental, neurological, and addictive disorders

A group of disorders that are typically characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. Disturbances in sexual response or sexual pleasure. Clinically significant. Destigmatize clinical assessment of sexual dysfunctions. Understand the risk factors. Assess for sexual functioning in the clinical interview. Remember that in many couples, underlying sexual dysfunctions exacerbate the presenting problem - whether that be issues in intimacy, communication, conflict resolution, infidelity, mood disorders, etc. Conduct the evaluation in comfortable surroundings and ensure privacy
Be empathic, nonjudgmental, and understanding
Preferably use the language in which patient is comfortable
Use neutral terms (as opposed to vulgar terms) and proper medical terms as long as there are in common usage (e.g., use 'penis' and 'vagina,' but perhaps 'lips' rather than 'labia')
Use anatomical drawings to understand patients knowledge and explain sexual issues to the patient
Reassure the patient that sexual dysfunction or adjustment problems are common and treatable. ("It is common for some people to...")
Explain things in simple, clear and specific terms. Some patients may not be able to understand the language which is commonly used by clinicians and may feel embarrassed to admit this. Hence, whenever new terms are used, provide alternatives or explanations. Check with the patients that they understand the terms used
Start with general, non-threatening questions first (e.g., "Do you have a regular partner?") then ask more specific and potentially embarrassing questions (e.g., "Do you also experience this problem when you masturbate, that is, when you touch or stimulate yourself?")
Assumptions must be avoided (e.g., sexual orientation, numbers of partners, sexual practices)
If a couple has presented together, gather the information for a sexual history from each individual separately (i.e., not in each other's presence)
Conduct the evaluation in presence of a female attendant/relative while examining patients of opposite gender
Make sure that the 'problem' does not just reflect a lack of knowledge or unrealistic expectations on the part of the presenting individual or their partner. Understand the cultural and religious factors which influence sexual issues
Although sexual dysfunction may occur in isolation, in many cases there may be co-existing problems contributing to the dysfunction (e.g., relationship difficulties, psychiatric or physical illness) - prioritize the treatment goals in such situations
Assess psychological sophistication and motivation of the patient/couple Bio / psycho / social
Trauma
Insecurity
Exposure / Introduction to Sex
Distraction
Depression
Anxiety
Poor Communication
Myths
Self-Image
It is usually not just one thing. There may be multiple drivers. Remember, all behavior makes sense in context. Rule out physical / biological, then proceed to psycho / social contributors. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diagnosis-(hdfs-8881)/lecture/12.-sexual-dysfunctions;-gender-dysphoria;-paraphilic-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diagnosis (HDFS 8881)/Lecture/12.

Scattered
Not alone
Disjointed
Disconnected Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person think, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem as though they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities. Delusions
Hallucinations
Disorganized Thinking (Speech)
Disorganized or Abnormal Behavior
Negative Symptoms (Mood) Altered perceptions (e.g., changes in vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste), abnormal thinking, and odd behaviors. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality and experience themselves and the world in a distorted way. Specifically, individuals typically experience: Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there
Delusions, which are firmly held beliefs not supported by objective facts (e.g., paranoia - irrational fears that others are 'out to get you' or believing that the television, radio, or internet are broadcasting special messages that require some response)
Thought Disorder, which includes unusual thinking or disorganized speech. Loss of motivation, disinterest or lack of enjoyment in daily activities
Social withdrawal
Difficulty showing emotions
Difficulty functioning normally
Specifically, individuals typically have: Reduced motivation and difficulty planning, beginning, and sustaining activities
Diminished Pleasure in every day life
"Flat Affect", or reduced expression of emotions via facial expression or voice tone. Problems in attention, concentration, and memory
For some individuals, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more prominent and interfere with activities like following conversations, learning new things, or remembering appointments. Specifically, individuals typically experience: Difficulty processing information to make decisions
Problems using information immediately after learning it
Trouble focusing or paying attention Schizophrenia
Schizoaffective Disorder

Family systems texts have case examples to look into. Get the spiral bound DSM Some MFTs are not using insurance but rather billing for self-pay. Collaborate with your client to use the DSM with transparency. If you are to put a diagnosis in the record, you must discuss this with the diagnosis. It is not consensual if the client is not aware of the diagnosis. You must be respectful of the client and their wishes. It is important to ensure trust with the public.

Emotionally focused couple therapy (EFT) is an empirically validated attachment based approach to couple therapy. From an EFT perspective, sexual functioning is viewed within the context of an attachment bond, but sexual satisfaction in EFT has not been empirically tested. We examined self-reported sexual satisfaction across 24 months in a sample of 32 couples who received an average of 21 EFT sessions. We found that sexual satisfaction increased across six time points from pre to post therapy and across follow-up (6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and that decreases in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy predicted increases in sexual satisfaction across time. These findings provide evidence that EFT may help couples improve their sexual satisfaction by reducing attachment avoidance in therapy.
Keywords: Need to Read ‚ÄúWhile happy couples attribute 15‚Äì20% of their happiness in the relationship to a satisfying sex life, couples in distressed relationships attribute 50‚Äì70% of their distress to sexual problems‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 1) (Potential Question: With your couples at the clinic, do you often discuss the role of sex in the relationship? How comfortable do you feel discussing about the role of sex between the clients? (Maybe on a scale of 1-10))

‚Äúcouples EFT resulted in improved sexual desire and a decrease in depressive symptoms‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)
‚ÄúThe goal of the current study is to examine self-reported sexual satisfaction, attachment anxiety and avoidance, and relationship satisfaction among couples receiving EFT and across 2 years after therapy has ended.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2) ‚ÄúSex is a way for couples to express affection, explore and experience intimacy, satisfy desire, lessen tension, restore connection after conflict, and shape personal and relational meaning‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)
‚ÄúSexual interest and arousal tend to foster interest in forming and maintaining close relationships, including increased self-disclosure, intimacy related thoughts, willingness to make sacrifices for a romantic partner, and greater wanting to resolve conflict in positive ways‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2) ‚ÄúMarital dissatisfaction and ongoing unresolved conflict may also be barriers to quality sexual experiences‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2) ‚ÄúSexual functioning and relationship functioning are inextricably linked and bidirectionally influential in couple relationships‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)‚Äúhigher levels of relationship satisfaction at one assessment wave predicted more positive changes in sexual satisfaction from that assessment wave to the next and vice versa‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)‚Äúchanges in sexual satisfaction correlated with changes in relationship quality, and that declines in sexual satisfaction were associated with increased divorce probability. Furthermore, sexual satisfaction predicts greater emotional intimacy in romantic relationships‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)‚ÄúTherapies for treating men with sexual dysfunction also seem to be most effective when they include relational concerns and attention to the interpersonal difficulties expressed‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)‚ÄúAttachment theory asserts that a securely attached partner in a relationship would be more confident and comfortable with his or her partner during moments of sex and intimacy, and better able to deal collaboratively with differences in preferences and desire‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚ÄúOptimally secure sex can be conceptualized as examples of effective interdependence in which both partners‚Äô needs are attended to, resulting in mutual satisfaction‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚ÄúIndividuals with secure attachment styles also seem to be notably more effective at emotion regulation‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚ÄúA secure attachment style is associated with greater flexible adaptation to new situations and exploration of novel environments‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚Äúinsecure attachment styles have been linked with fewer positive sexual feelings and more negative ones across multiple studies‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚ÄúThere are two main styles of attachment insecurity that are typically measured on two dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. High levels of attachment anxiety involve worrying about the availability of close others, whereas high levels of attachment avoidance involve an inflated sense of independence and denial of attachment needs‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚ÄúIndividuals high on attachment anxiety were reported to emphasize emotional dissatisfactions that occurred during sex, whereas individuals high on attachment avoidance were more likely to describe the physical aspects of sex that were dissatisfying‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚Äúthose with high attachment anxiety tend to use sex more readily as a tool for determining the status of‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)‚Äúsex for anxiously attached individuals was more likely to increase emotional appraisals (such as feeling loved), be used to sustain a relationship (thus avoiding abandonment), or be used as a way to coax a partner‚Äôs love and affection‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚ÄúPartners with high attachment anxiety generally weigh these daily relational and sexual events more heavily in their view of the relationship than do securely attached partners‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚ÄúHigher levels of attachment anxiety are associated with having sex to reduce insecurity or facilitate closeness in a relationship‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚ÄúIndividuals with high attachment avoidance have been found to have sex as a means to bolster personal opinions of themselves (attractiveness etc.) and incur bragging rights‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚ÄúThose individuals also more readily rely on self-pleasing mechanisms, including higher levels of masturbation and increased levels of fantasizing about persons other than their partner‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúindividuals high in attachment avoidance generally are less likely to engage in sex for the formation and promotion of relational closeness or emotional connectedness. Sexual interactions in this way are typified by less intimate copulatory positions, and a less positive view of affectionate behaviors such as kissing, cuddling, and so on‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúhighly avoidant individuals are more likely to engage in sex to maximize control and dominance and avoid closeness and emotional accessibility‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúhighly avoidant individuals tend to limit the level of emotional intimacy in sexual encounters‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚ÄúHigher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with a greater tendency to perceive that their partner controls sex in the relationship and that the sexual outcome is dependent primarily on situational contributions and factors‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúthose with insecure attachment styles also have much stronger concerns about their sexual performance and are less willing to experiment sexually with their partner‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúinsecure partners also are more likely to report problems in sexual communication‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚ÄúEFT‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúconceptualizes relationship distress as the result of an insecure attachment‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)‚Äúbond‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚ÄúEFT is effective in helping couples create more secure attachment bonds that last over the years following completion of therapy‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚ÄúEFT is carried out in three stages. The first stage, cycle deescalation, involves helping couples gain an understanding of their negative cycle of conflict, particularly underlying attachment needs and fears. The second stage of EFT, restructuring attachment interactions, involves helping couples explore and express to one another their attachment needs and emotions. The third stage, consolidation and integration, involves helping the two people bring their new understanding of one another and the relationship into their everyday lives as they strive to resolve sources of conflict and areas of concern.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚Äúa secure attachment style has been found to be associated with positive feelings, trust, and greater relationship satisfaction in relationships‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚ÄúThose with a secure attachment style are more likely to be able to assert their need for support to their partner‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚ÄúSecure attachment also extends to how a person approaches emotional risk taking, which results in greater ability to provide emotional support for others‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚Äúattachment theory, attachment styles develop in the context of relationships and impact ways of being in those relationships. In EFT, therapists help couples create a secure attachment bond in the specific couple relationships through the use of experiential and systemic interventions to help partners explore and express attachment-related emotions and needs to one another and foster empathic responding in structured conversations‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚ÄúEFT can help couples improve their sexual relationships, which begins with viewing the couple‚Äôs sexual relationship from an attachment lens‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚Äúthe EFT therapist is able to recognize and account for the power of sexual responses in defining the quality of the love relationship, thus working with the couple to specifically address the difficulties in their sex life as a part of repairing the relationship.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚Äúproponents of EFT propose three kinds of sex: ‚Äúsealed-off sex,‚Äù ‚Äúsolace sex,‚Äù and ‚Äúsynchrony sex‚Äù‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚Äú‚ÄúSealed-off sex‚Äù involves pleasure seeking without attention to the relationship, a tendency of more avoidant partners.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)‚Äú‚Äúsolace sex‚Äù is characterized by seeking sex as a way of soothing anxieties or insecurities in the relationship, as is common among more anxiously attached partners‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)‚Äú‚ÄúSynchrony sex,‚Äù from an EFT perspective, is characteristic of attachment security and involves a focus on the relationship and sexual pleasure, bringing the two together‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)‚ÄúThis kind of sex involves seeking new experiences, feeling safe enough to ask for one‚Äôs sexual needs to be met, and responding to one‚Äôs partner‚Äôs needs in an attuned way‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)‚ÄúThe current study is an examination of sexual satisfaction among couples who receive EFT.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)‚Äúwe map the trajectory of sexual satisfaction at pretherapy, posttherapy, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months follow-up.

A further limitation was lack of precision in our measure of sexual satisfaction, the GMSEX‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚Äúwhich measures sexual satisfaction according to subjective rating scales representing the sexual relationship according to five continua‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚ÄúThis does not account for the frequency of sex, which is an important part of sexual satisfaction‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚Äúor the importance of sex to the couple relationship.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚ÄúFuture research should examine change in sexual satisfaction in EFT using a waitlist-control group, should employ more than one measure of sexual satisfaction to increase precision in the measurement of this construct, and should attempt to recruit a larger sample.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚ÄúA full examination of sex differences‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚Äúshould be examined in the future‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚Äúmale but not female partners, displays of sexual desire predicted reductions in relationship-specific attachment anxiety in their partner and reductions in relationship-specific attachment avoidance in themselves across 8 months‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚Äúfor female but not male partners, displays of intimacy (i.e., warmth, closeness, and affection) predicted reductions in relationship-specific attachment anxiety and avoidance in their partners across the 8 months‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)‚Äúwe found that sexual satisfaction increased significantly from pre to post therapy with decelerated changed across 2 years of follow-up for couples receiving EFT. We also found that reductions in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy significantly predicted higher sexual satisfaction across time points, suggesting that reductions in attachment avoidance (as facilitated through EFT) may be an important factor toward improving sexual satisfaction for couples over the long term. These results also suggest that attachment avoidance may play a significant role in the sexual relationship of distressed couples, and may have value as a target of change to improve sexual satisfaction for these couples.‚Äù (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 17)]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@wiebeattachmentchangeemotionally2019.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Couples (HDFS 8876)/Readings/@wiebeAttachmentChangeEmotionally2019.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 09:53:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@dohertyDiscernmentCounselingMixed2016]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This article describes discernment counseling, an approach to working with couples where one partner is leaning toward divorce and the other wants to preserve the relationship and work on it in couples therapy. These ‚Äúmixed‚Äêagenda‚Äù couples are common in clinical practice but have been neglected in the literature. The goal of discernment counseling is clarity and confidence regarding the next steps for the relationship, based on a deeper understanding of each partner's contributions. Sessions emphasize individual conversations with each partner. An analysis of 100 consecutive cases found that about half of the couples chose to start couples therapy in order to reconcile, with most of the rest choosing the divorce path. Longer term follow‚Äêup information is also presented.

People constantly construct knowledge, and we function in a perpetual state of assessing the information that is presented to us. Interpreting the perceptions of what we see and what we hear allows us to reach conclusion about the world around us. The investigator's interpretation of information and evidence commonly requires answers to many questions that can lead critical of decisions, action, and outcomes, such as: What must be done to protect the life and safety of persons?
Should force, up to and including deadly force, be used to resolve a situation?
Who will become the focus or subject of a criminal investigation?
What is the best plan to apprehend the person or persons responsible for a criminal act?
Will someone be subjected to a search of their person or of their home?
Will someone be subjected to detention or arrest and questioning for a criminal act?
Will someone have a criminal charge sworn against them?
Will someone be subjected to a criminal trial?
Will someone's liberty as a free person be at-risk?
Will justice be served?
Will the community be protected? The investigator must always be ready to explain their thinking and actions to the court. Thinking must illustrate an evidence-based path to forming reasonable ground for beliefs and subsequent action. Thinking must demonstrate consideration of the statutory law and case law relevant to the matter being investigated. Investigation is the collection and analysis of evidence. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/books/introduction-to-criminal-investigation,-processes,-practices,-and-thinking.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Research Citations/Books/Introduction to Criminal Investigation, Processes, Practices, and Thinking.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:34:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bibliography: Nichols, M.

The Undeclared War: We came to think of asylums as places of cruelty and detention, they were originally built to rescue the insane from being locked away in family attics.
Therapists began to notice that often when a patient got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member.
Patients often improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home.
Parents use their children as a buffer to protect them from intimacy. Small Group Dynamics: Group dynamics were applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group.
The Group Mind (1920) (McDougall) A group‚Äôs continuity depends on boundaries for differentiation of function and on customs and habits to make relationships predictable. <br>Field theory by <a data-href="Kurt Lewin" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/kurt-lewin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kurt Lewin</a>. He developed the notion that a group is more than the sum of its parts. Quasi-stationary social equilibrium: changing group behavior requires ‚Äòunfreezing.‚Äô Only after something shakes up group‚Äôs beliefs will its members be prepared to change. In individual therapy this process is initiated by the unhappy experiences that lead people to seek help.
More effort is required to unfreeze, or shake up, families before real change can take place. The need for unfreezing foreshadowed early family therapists‚Äô concern about disrupting family homeostasis.

Fight-flight, dependency, and pairing: Some families skirt around hot issues like a cat circling a snake. Others use therapy to bicker endlessly, never really contemplating compromise, much less change.
Dependency masquerades as therapy when families allow therapists to subvert their autonomy in the name of problem solving.
Pairing is seen in families when one parent colludes with the children to undermine the other parent.

Roles tend to be complementary. Eventually parents of misbehaving children may become polarized into complementary roles of strictness and leniency. What makes such reciprocity resistant to change is that the roles reinforce each other.
Group and family therapy are similar: Both are complex and dynamic, more like everyday life than individual therapy. In groups and families, patients must react to a number of people, not just a therapist, and therapeutic use of this interaction is the definitive mechanism of change in both contexts.
It turns out that the differences between families and groups are so significant that the group therapy model has only limited applicability to family treatment. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy very different from group therapy.
This feeling of safety among sympathetic strangers cannot be part of family therapy because instead of separating treatment from a stressful environment, the stressful environment is brought into the consulting room. <br><a data-href="The Child Guidance Movement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Child Guidance Movement</a>: It was Freud who introduced the idea that psychological disorders were the result of unsolved problems of childhood.

A primary negative injunction, such as "Don't do X, or I will punish you."
A second injunction at a more abstract level conflicting with the first, also enforced by punishment or perceived threat.
A tertiary negative injunction prohibiting escape and demanding a response. Without this restriction the victim won't feel bound. Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer necessary once the victim is conditioned to perceive the world in terms of double binds; any part of the sequence becomes sufficient to trigger panic or rage. Most examples of double binds in literature are inadequate because they do not include all the critical features. An example of a double bind would be a teacher who urges his students to participate in class but gets impatient if one of them actually interrupts with a question or comment. A schizophrenic has to deal with them continually - and the effect is maddening. Unable to comment on the dilemma, the schizophrenic responds defensively, perhaps by being concrete and literal, perhaps by speaking in metaphors. Eventually, the schizophrenic may come to assume that behind every statement lies a concealed meaning. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families cause schizophrenia.

Wynne linked the new concept of communication deviance to the older notion of though disorder.

Mystification distorts feelings and, more ominously, reality. When parents mystify a child's experience, the child's existence becomes inauthentic.

Positive feedback can have desirable or undesirable consequences. If left unchecked, the reinforcing effects of positive feedback tend to compound a system's errors, leading to a runaway process. Malignant worry, phobic avoidance, and other forms of neurotic behavior may start out with a relatively trivial concern and escalate into an out-of-control process. Example: a panic attack may start out as a relatively harmless instance of being out of breath, but a panicky response to breathlessness may spiral into a terrifying experience. Feedback loops indicate a basic circularity where each element has an effect on the next, until the last element 'feeds back' the cumulative effect into the first part of the cycle. Thus A affects B, which in turn affects C, which feeds back to A, and so on. To survive and adapt to the world around them, all communication systems - including families - need a balance of negative and positive feedback. The cybernetic system turned out to be a useful metaphor for describing how families maintain stability. Cybernetics was the brainchild of MIT mathematician Norbert Weiner (1948). During WWII, Weiner was asked to design a better way to control the targeting of antiaircraft artillery. Weiner's solution was to incorporate a system of internal feedback that enabled antiaircraft guns to regulare their own operations. The signal used to control the artillery was a self-regulating servomechanism - the technical term for the first automated machines.
He distinguish two modes of information, discrete or continuous - digital or analog.

In 1967 Haley joined Salvador Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
In 1976 Haley moved to Washington DC with Cloe Madanes he founded the Family Therapy Institute. Madanes currently works with motivational speaker and life coach Anthony Robbins. In 1955 Haley moved back to California. He dies in 2007. Jame Keim in California, who developed an innovative way of working with oppositional children, is ably carrying on the Haley-Madanes tradition. Other prominent practitioners of this model include Neil Schiffin Washington DC; Scott Sells at the Savannah Family Institute; and Jerome Price in Michigan. The MRI model had a major impact on the Milan Associates, Mara Selvini Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo, Gianfranco Cecchin, and Guiliana Prata. The Milan Associates eventually split, with Palazzoli and Prata focusing on invariant prescriptions and eventually incorporating more psycho analytic concepts into their work, and Boscolo and Cecchin focusing on circular questioning. Both groups currently have training centers in Italy. Giorgio Nardone is another prominent Italian family therapist who trained at the MRI. In Pragmatics of Human Communication Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson sought to develop a calculus of human communication, which they stated in a series of axioms. People are always communicating. Since all behavior is communicative and since one cannot not behave, then it follows that one cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. The report (or content) of a message conveys information, while the command is a statement about the relationship. <br><a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>: <br>In families, command messages are patterned as <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>, which can be deduced from repeated patterns of interaction. <br>Jackson used the term <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a> as a description of regularity, not regulation.

Homeostatic mechanisms bring families back to equilibrium in the fae of disruption and thus serve to resist change. <br>Jackson's notion of family homeostasis describes the conservative aspect of family systems and is similar to the cybernetic concept of <a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>. According to the communication analysis, families operate as goal-directed, rule-governed systems. Communications theorists didn‚Äôt look for underlying motives; instead, they assumed circular causality and analyzed patterns of communications linked together in chains of stimulus and response as feedback loops. When the response to a family member‚Äôs problematic behavior exacerbates the problem, that chain is seen as a positive feedback loop.
The advantage of this formulation is that it focuses on interactions that perpetuate problems, which can be changed, instead of inferring underlying causes, which are often not subject to change. <br><a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>: Strategic therapists made the concept of the positive feedback loop the centerpieve of the model. For the MRI group, this translated into a simple yet powerful principle of problem formation: Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how family members respond to it. Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This only produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, and so on - in a vicious cycle. <br>The family system is reacting to a deviation in the behavior of one of its members within feedback designed to dampen that deviation (<a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>), but has the effect of amplifying the deviation (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>).

Find a way to change the rules in order to interrupt problem-maintaining behavior. Jay Haley added a functionalist emphasis to the cybernetic interpretation with his interest in the interpersonal payoff of behavior. Later, he incorporated structural concepts developed during the years he spent with Minuchin. <br><a data-href="Hierarchical Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchical-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Structure</a>: Haley believed that the rules around the hierarchical structure of a family are crucial and found inadequate parental hierarchies lurking behind most problems. Haley suggested that 'an individual is more disturbed in direct proportion to the number of malfunctioning hierarchies in which he is embedded.' <br>To counter a problem's payoff, Haley borrowed Erickson's technique of <a data-href="Prescribing Ordeals" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/prescribing-ordeals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prescribing Ordeals</a>, so that the price for keeping a symptom outweighed that of giving it up. Like Haley, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her associates focused on power games in families and on the protective function symptoms served for a family. They explored families' histories over several generations, searching for evidence to confirm their hypotheses about how children's symptoms came to be necessary. These hypotheses often involved elaborate networks of family alliances and coalitions. They frequently concluded that patients developed symptoms to protect one or more family members so as to maintain the delicate network of extended family alliances. Strategic therapists say little more than whatever works is normal and that what makes families malfunction are solutions that don't work. <br>According to <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>, normal families, like all living systems, depend on two processes: They maintain integrity in the face of environmental challenges through negative feedback. No living system can survive without a coherent structure. Negative feedback resists disruptions Too rigid a structure leaves a system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. That is why normal families also have mechanisms of positive feedback. Positive feedback amplifies innovations to accommodate to changed circumstances. Recognizing that the channel for feedback is communication makes it possible to state the case more plainly: Healthy families are able to adapt because they communicate clearly and are flexible. <br><a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: Resolutely opposed standards of normality.

One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families usually seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions. <br>Families are organized in <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> with <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> regulating the contact family members have with one another.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure
Seeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family." Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. "Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them." Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.
Maps the family's underlying structure.
Intervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating
Enactment
Structural Mapping
Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
Boundary Making
Unbalancing
Challenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong
Pushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Virginia Satir <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> and <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a>

F. Skinner</a>. In 1948, Wolpe introduced systematic desensitization.

Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.
The operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Skills taught in sequence.

According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania. The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. <br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy. Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. <br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href="Schemas" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone. Hidden assumptions have a potent impact on how people perceive and react to each other. <br><a data-href="Behavior Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/behavior-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavior Exchange Theory</a>: A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control. A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills. Neil Jacobson (1981): Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. Attention is a powerful social reinforcer. The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)
Even when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.
Others persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. <br>The use of <a data-href="Aversion Control" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills. Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease') Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. <br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up. These schemas are the basis of biased assumptions that poison relationships by distorting family members' responses to each other.

The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Consists of reinforcing change in small steps. <br><a data-href="Token Economy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/token-economy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Token Economy</a>: Use points to reward children for good behavior. <br><a data-href="Contingency Contracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-contracting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Contracting</a>: Agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their children. <br><a data-href="Contingency Management" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-management.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Management</a>: Giving and taking away rewards based on children's behavior. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a>: Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior. S for stimulus
O for the state of the organism
R for the target response
KC for the contingency of consequences Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. <br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href="Premack Principle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premack Principle</a> is applied. High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting. Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.
Case Study: Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind. The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession. The most widely used in the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale, a 23-item questionnaire covering various aspects of marital satisfaction, including communication, sex, affection, social activities, and values. Assessments are designed to reveal strengths and weaknesses of a couple's relationship and the manner in which rewards and punishments are exchanged. Interviews and questionnaires are used to specify and elaborate target behaviors. Jacobson's (1981) Pretreatment Assessment for Marital Therapy: Strengths and skills of the relationship: What are the major strengths of this relationship?
What behaviors on the part of each spouse are highly valued by the other?
What shared activities does the couple currently engage in? Presenting Problems: What are the major complaints, and how do these complaints translate into explicit behavioral terms?
What are the reinforcers maintaining these behaviors?
What behaviors occur at less than the desired frequency or fail to occur at appropriate times from the standpoint of each spouse?
What are the consequences of these behaviors currently, when they occur? Sex and Affection: Is either spouse currently dissatisfied with rate, quality, or diversity of sex life together?
If sex is currently a problem, was there a time when it was mutually satisfying?
What are the sexual behaviors that seem to be associated with current dissatisfaction?
Are either or both partners dissatisfied with the amount or quality of nonsexual physical affection? Future Prospects: Are the partners seeking therapy to improve their relationship, to separate, or to decide whether the relationship is worth working on?
What are each spouse's reasons for continuing the relationship despite the current problems? Assessment of Social Environment: What are each person's alternatives to the present relationship?
How attractive are these alternatives to each person?
Is the environment (parents, relatives, friends, work associates, children) supportive of either continuance or dissolution of present relationship? Individual Functioning of Each Spouse: Does either spouse exhibit emotional or behavioral problems?
Have they been in therapy before, either alone or together? What kind of therapy? Outcome?
What is each spouse's past experience with intimate relationships?
How is the present relationship difference? Richard Stuart (1975) lists five strategies that summarize the behavioral approach to troubled marriages: Couples are taught to express themselves in a clear, behavior descriptions rather than in vague complaints.
Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations.

John Walter and Jane Peller practice together in Chicago. They trained at the BFTC. Like the MRI group, solution-focused therapists believe that people are constrained by narrow views of their problems into perpetuating rigid patterns of false solutions. O'Hanlon and Weiner-Davis (1989): So, the meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. If the methods used do not produce a satisfactory outcome, the original assumption about the meaning of the behavior is generally not questioned... Instead, people often redouble their efforts to solve the problem in an ineffective way, thinking that by doing it more, harder or better (e.g. more punishments, more heart-to-heart talks, and so on) they will finally solve it. The MRI model was inspired by Milton Erickson's view of people as containing cast reservoirs of untapped creativity. According to this view, people may need only a shift of perspective to release their potential. Part of that shift involves changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tend to be different from the language of solutions. The language of solutions is more hopeful and future oriented. Part of a therapist's job is to steer clients from problem talk to solution talk. In the solution-focused model, the future is negotiable. The more you emphasize family dynamics, the more you see people embedded in a network of connections that constrain their actions. Solution-focused therapists pay less attention to the forces controlling family members because they see people as relatively fluid and changeable - and they treat them that way in therapy. In the solution-focused model, clients are assumed to be the experts on their own lives. "Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?"
"If as a practitioner, you wish to put clients into the position of being experts on their own lives, you will have to know how to set aside your own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of your clients." Solution-focused therapists assume that people are resourceful. The problems they have are not seen as evidence of failure but rather as normal life-cycle complications. It can be seen as a commitment to the belief that families have the ability to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. Implicit in this model is an asymptomatic perspective on family normality; that is, a normal family is simply one that has been freed of its presenting problems and thus returned to its own unique functional way of living. "Solution-oriented therapists don't believe that there is any single 'correct' or 'valid' way to live one's life. We have come to understand that what is unacceptable behavior in one family or for one person is desirable behavior in another. Therefore, clients, not therapists, identify the goals to be accomplished in treatment. The very act of categorizing people suggests they are a certain way all the time. Solution-focused therapists steer clients away from speculating about problem formation, they also avoid such conjecture themselves. Their conviction is that solutions are often unrelated to the way problems developed and that exploring etiology is engaging in problem talk - exactly what they seek to avoid. They believe that problem-focused thinking keeps people from discovering effective solutions. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. Solution-focused therapy works by setting clear goals and building on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is never a simple matter of implementing a few specific techniques. It is - or should be - a complicated enterprise involving all the elements that make helping relationships work. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting complaint as expeditiously as possible. The search for underlying flaws is rejected. Solution-focused therapists don't believe it's necessary to delve into these deeper issues in order to help people resolve their problems. The goal is never about how families should be structure but only what they want different in their lives. The process of goal setting itself is an important intervention in this approach. It is important to assist client in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. Helping people to stop dwelling on their dissatisfactions and envision what they want to be doing instead is seen as the first step in helping them get there. Solution-focused therapy works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems - effective solutions already in their repertoire. What's needed for change is a shift in the way a problem is 'languaged': "What we talk about and how we talk about it makes a difference, and it is these differences that can be used to make a difference to the client." Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished because 'as the client and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in the truth of reality of what they are talking about. This is the way language works, naturally.' This is why solution-focused therapy can be so brief: It's a lot easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior. The assumption is that getting them to talk positively to solve their problems. After getting a brief description of the presenting complaint, solution-focused practitioners move directly to asking clients how things will be different in their lives when their problems are solved. Then, instead of formulating some kind of intervention plan, the therapist asks about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. The following questions suggest the proactive nature of a solution-focused assessment: "What do you think the problem is now?"
"How will you know when the problem is solved?"
"How will you know you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?"
"What will have to be different for that to happen in terms of your behavior, thoughts, and feelings?"
"What will you notice that is different about others involved in the situation?"
"What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?" They say that anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions. They also need little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand. Solution-focused therapists ask more about perceptions than about feelings. And they affirm the clients' position. All clients want some indication that their therapist has understood the point of view that guides their actions. The solution-focused therapist doesn't function as an expert in determining what's wrong (enmeshment, triangulation) and planning how to correct it. Clients are the experts on what they want to change. Although solution-focused therapists don't play the role of an authority figure who will help clients solve their problems, they do take an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. The following sorts of questions are asked to lay the groundwork for therapeutic goal development: "What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?"
"What needs to happen so that this will not have been a waste of your time?"
"Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problem that brought you here today?" Based on the answers to these questions, the therapist and clients begin to construct a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once this description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the clients to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represents the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone or the clients are coping with it so well that it is no longer problematic. The clients' rating makes it possible to assess how far they are from the goal. Later, the same scale can be used to determine what specific actions will allow the clients to move toward the goal and to evaluate progress. If the clients identify new problems, the therapist makes a new scale to depict desired outcomes and to assess progress toward new solutions. Practitioners distinguish between visitors, complainants, and customers. <br><a data-href="Visitor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/visitor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Visitor</a>s: Someone who's not really in the market for therapy.
Visitors are there at someone else's insistence, but they don't really have a complaint and don't want to be there. Therapists should not offer any suggestions to these clients or seek to convince them that they really need therapy. It is important to pay attention to how they were referred and to consider who the real client is - the individual who wants something to change.
If the people in your office are present only because someone pressured them to be there, a useful strategy is to ask them what they need to do to satisfy the authority that compelled them to seek therapy. "So, what has to happen to get your mother off your back?"
"What's the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?" <br><a data-href="Complainant" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complainant.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complainant</a>s: They have clear complaints, but they're usually about someone else. It may be useful to suggest noticing exceptions in the problem behavior of the other family member. The solution-focused therapist accepts the complainant's views, gives compliments, and may suggest observing exceptions to the complaint pattern. With such clients, solution-focused therapists try to shift the conversation from problem talk to solution talk. "How were you hoping I might be useful to you?" Then strategize with them about how they can act differently to influence those recalcitrant others. <br><a data-href="Customer" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/customer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Customer</a>s: They have clear complaints and are ready to take action. With a customer, you can move directly to establish goals and look for solutions. These distinctions are not qualities of character but qualities of the therapeutic relationship and therefore fluid. With an apparently unmotivated complainant, a therapist's job is to engage in a solution-focused conversation, compliment the client, and possibly give an assignment to observe exceptions to the problem. By not pushing for change but instead shifting attention away from problems and toward solutions, the relationship may evolve into one in which the client becomes a customer for change. Solution-focused techniques are organized around two fundamental strategies: Developing well-focused goals within the clients' frame of reference. Generating solutions based on exceptions. Therapy is usually brief (3-5 sessions), and appointments are made one at a time, on the assumption that one more may be enough. Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem: "How were you hoping I could help you?" Solution-focused therapists take pains to work within the clients' frame of reference. They ask for the clients' perceptions and are careful to acknowledge them, using the clients' own language as much as possible. It is a good idea to ask clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. People usually attempt various strategies to deal with their problems, and these efforts may have been more or less successful. Either way, these previous attempts at solution now play an important part in the clients' perception of what works and doesn't work for them. The next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. Solution-focused therapists help translate vague or amorphous goals into specific, behavioral terms by asking questions like: "Specifically how will you be doing this?"
"How will the two of you know when you have solved your problems? How will things be different?"
"What will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else?" The clearer the goal, the easier it is to measure progress. "What will you be doing differently?"
Part of the process of solution-focused therapy is helping clients think about constructive actions they can take rather than how they can get someone else to change. Useful goals are specific and include positive actions. They are also modest enough to be achievable. <br><a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a>: "Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened and the problem which brought you here is solved? "
The miracle question invites clients to envision positive outcomes and begins to activate a problem-solving mind-set by giving them a mental picture of their goals. The miracle question also helps clients look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do the things that the problem has been obstructing. If the therapist can encourage them to begin doing those things despite the problem, suddenly the problem may not loom as large. <br>Probing for exceptions - times when clients did not have the problem - invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. Such probing involves asking <a data-href="Exception Question" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/exception-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Exception Question</a>s like these: "When in the recent past might the problem have happened but did not (or was less intense or more manageable)?"
"What's different about those times when the problem does not happen?"
"How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you?" Finding the exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail. Also, and since these exceptions just happened, it's more plausible that they could happen again. By exploring these times and what was different about them, clients find clues to what they can do to expand these exceptions. Exploring exceptions allows the therapist and client to build on past successes. Failing that, the therapist can ask why things are not worse - "How did you manage that?" - and then build on that accomplishment. <br><a data-href="Coping Questions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coping-questions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coping Questions</a>: Can help clients recognize that simply by enduring, they are more resourceful than they realize: "What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?"
"How come things are not worse?"
"What have you done to keep them from getting worse?" If the client provides answers, the therapist can build on them with questions about how that endurance can be maintained and how more of that effort can be brought to bear. A solution-focused therapist spends most of the session listening for evidence of previous solutions, exceptions, and goals. When such evidence comes out, the therapist punctuates it with enthusiasm and support. The therapist then works to keep solution talk in the forefront. Scaling questions were introduced to help therapists and clients talk about vague topics such a depression and communication, where it is difficult to identify concrete changes. "The therapists asks the depressed client, for example, "On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now?" The therapist and client can recognize and nurture small changes toward the goal rather than being stuck. Scaling questions are also used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. "On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that.. this week?" This device has a kind of 'prove-it' implication. The response is followed up by asking clients what they might do to increase the odds of success: "What do you have to do to stick to your guns this time?" Asking scaling questions is a useful way of anticipating and disarming resistance and backsliding and of encouraging commitment to change. This intervention has two major components: It is a solution-focused assessment device. If it is used each session, the therapist and clients have an ongoing measure of progress. It is a powerful intervention by itself because it allows the therapist to focus on previous solutions and exceptions and to punctuate new changes as they occur. Like the changes made before the first session, one of three things can happen between each session: Things can get better If things get better from one session to the next, the therapist compliments the clients and then gets details about how they were able to make such changes. This not only supports and solidifies the changes but also nudges clients to do more of the same. Things can stay the same If things stay the same, the clients can be complimented on maintaining their changes or for not letting things get worse: "How did you keep it from going down?" The therapist can again compliment and support and encourage more of that change. Things can get worse Compliments are conveyed with questions: "Wow! How did you do that?" Phrasing calls attention to the fact that the clients have already accomplished something. Doing so invites clients to describe their successes and thus helps foster self-confidence. <br>To be effective, <a data-href="Compliments" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/compliments.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Compliments</a> should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Most clients know what is wrong but have run out of ideas about how to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work. Solution-focused therapy is often practiced in a team approach, with a therapist in the session and colleagues observing behind the mirror. Whether working with a team or alone, the therapist usually takes a 10-minute break near the end of the session. During this time, the therapist (with the team or alone) composes a summary message to the clients. The session break can be used to promote a collaborative mind-set: "We're nearing the end of the session and I would like to take a 10-minute break. This is to give you time to think and reflect about what we have discussed; to pick out any important ideas came up, or to make decisions or plans. You might also like to think about whether this session has been useful and how you would like us to be further involved, if that would be helpful. While you are thinking, I will consult with my team for their thoughts. We will think together about what you said. When we get back together, I will be interested to hear what stood out for you today. I will also share the teams' thoughts with you. Together, then, we can put something together that will be helpful." The summary message begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the clients' goals, and pre-session progress and strengths: "What I have hear you tell me today..." This recap is followed by a statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy, a reflection of the emotional impact on the client, compliments on pre-session changes or strengths, and some comment on the client's goals. The therapist then makes suggestions about building positives. Among the suggestions used commonly in solution-focused therapy are the following: The formula first-session task: "Between now and the next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens in your family that you ant to continue to have happen." Do more of what works.
Do something different. The suggestion to do something different can be given as an experiment. Go slow. This suggestion, taken from the MRI model, is designed to help clients overcome fear of change by asking about possible negative consequences of changing and warning against trying to change too rapidly. Do the opposite. This suggestion is based on the notion that many problems are maintained by attempted solutions. Suggesting that clients try the opposite of what they have been doing is especially useful for problems that exist between just two people. The prediction task. "Before you go to bed tonight, predict whether the problem will be better or the same tomorrow. Tomorrow night rate the day, and compare it with your prediction. Think about what may have accounted for the right or wrong prediction. Repeat this every night until we meet again." The solution-focused approach is drawing attention to the family's resources and encouraging them to capitalize on their strengths in order to focus on solutions rather than problems. Later sessions are devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress. When a family returns for a subsequent session, the solution-focused therapist endeavors to create a cooperative mind-set and then inquires about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the client's role in attaining it. Then the therapist assists the clients in looking forward to how they will plan their next steps toward solution: "What's better?" or "What happened that you liked?"
"Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that."
"Wow! That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?"
"And what else is better? What do you think the next step might be? On a scale of 1 to 10, you say your progress is now at a 5. What would a 6 look like?"
If there was no discernable progress, coping questions may be asked: "How did you keep things from getting worse?"
"What's your idea about what might be helpful?"
"What do you think the next step should be?" Suggestions: Notice some positive about the child: their colorful sneakers, team cap, etc. Use relationship questions such as 'What would your mother tell me is your best subject in school?'
Avoid 'why' questions. Try asking 'how come?'; It is less intimidating. Responding to 'I do not know"; Acknowledge that it was a hard question, then say, "Suppose you did know; what would you say?" or "What would your best friend say?" Its promise of quick solutions has endeared it to the managed care industry, and providers have been eager to identify thgemselves as solution-focused. Its applications includ: Couples therapy
Family therapy
Behavioral problems in children
Families with suicidal members
Domestic violence
Sexual abuse
Alcoholism
Families with children with severe intellectual disabilities, and schizophrenia. <br>Some have proposed models that incorporate solution-focused techniques (e.g., <a data-href="Scaling Questions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/scaling-questions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Scaling Questions</a>, <a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a>) into other forms of family therapy, most commonly structural family therapy, in the treatment of adolescent substance use, adoption, and low-conflict divorce. The solution-focused model has also been applied outside of traditional therapeutic practice to include interventions in family medicine clinics, social service agencies, nursing care, educational settings and model schools, and business systems.
The two most powerful ingredients in solution-focused therapy are: Building on what works
Helping people identify what they want rather than what they don't want People who come for help often think of the times when their problems don't occur as unimportant because these occasions seem accidental or inconsistent. Calling attention to past successes and latent abilities helps clients rediscover their own best coping strategies. The great thing about the imagination is that with very limited encouragement, people can see themselves as succeeding rather than fumbling and failing. In the solution-focused therapist, clients have a coach and guide to help them work toward this brighter future. Like any approach in the early stages of evolution, solution-focused therapy was sometimes presented in a cookbook style, leading some to imagine that treatment can be reduced to a set of formulaic techniques. The unique features of solution-focused therapy are deceptively easy to describe, but like all therapies, it takes great skill to implement effectively. A second major criticism of solution-focused therapy is that its insistence on solution talk may cut off clients from empathy and understanding. The issue of whether solution-focused therapy is genuinely collaborative has been raised frequently. This approach has even been called 'solution-forced therapy' by some because of the perceived tendency for therapists to pressure clients into discussing only positives. Solution-focused therapists have stressed the importance of the therapeutic relationship. "The speed and success of solution construction depend on the therapist's ability to stay connected with the clients' reality throughout the course of therapy. This is the underpinning for the whole collaborative process, the grease that keeps the axles turning."
The solution-focused approach won't likely be effective if therapists, in a rush to get to their own agenda, fail to listen to clients and make them feel understood. It is unfortunate that more research has not been done to test the effectiveness of solution-focused therapy. Most of the research has been conducted by solution-focused practitioners themselves. It has been concluded that while methodological weaknesses existed in most cases using solution-focused therapy, the studies do provide tentative support for the use of solution-focused brief therapy in the treatment of a child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. It was also concluded that solution-focused therapy may hold more promise as a mode of early intervention when the presenting problem is not as severe. One aims to help clients do less of what doesn‚Äôt work; the other promotes more of what does. Both of these pragmatic approaches focus on the presenting complaint and aim to resolve it as quickly as possible. The MRI model does so by looking for failed solutions to eliminate; the solution-focused approach searches for forgotten solutions to rediscover. whereas the MRI approach focuses on behavior, the solution-focused model emphasizes cognition as well as behavior. MRI therapists urge clients to do things differently; solution-focused therapists urge them to view things differently. Problems are seen as persisting in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. The idea is that people often get stuck in their problems because by trying to get to the bottom of them, they overlook solutions that are right under their noses.
the development of a set of techniques for changing problem talk into solution talk. These techniques include:
Exception questions (‚ÄúCan you think of a time when you didn‚Äôt have the problem? What were you doing then?‚Äù)
The miracle question (‚ÄúSuppose you went to sleep and a miracle happened such that when you awoke, your problem was solved. What would be different?‚Äù)
Scaling questions (‚ÄúOn a scale from 1 to 10, how do you feel now compared to when you called?‚Äù)
Coping questions (‚ÄúGiven how bad that was, how were you able to cope?‚Äù)
The formula first-session task (‚ÄúAfter you leave today, observe what happens that you want to continue during the next week.‚Äù)
Compliments (‚ÄúWow, you must be very smart to have thought of that!‚Äù). These techniques are put into practice as soon as possible to keep the work brief and to discourage clients from dwelling on the negative side of their experience. This has led to a call for greater collaboration with clients so that their feelings are acknowledged and validated before solution-focused techniques are introduced.
Some of its popularity can be attributed to therapists‚Äô struggle to find ways to feel effective while living with managed care‚Äôs limited number of sessions. In addition, the techniques of this therapy are relatively easy to learn (the basics can be picked up in a few workshops), and its upbeat nature makes it more enjoyable for many therapists. Yet its easy-to-learn formula leads some therapists to dismiss it as superficial. Critics question whether therapists are really having a respectful conversation with clients when they only coax optimism. <br><a data-href="Hermeneutics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hermeneutics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hermeneutics</a> The art of analyzing literary texts or human experience, understood as fundamentally ambiguous, by interpreting levels of meaning. <br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a>

It's approach is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave. Personal experience is fundamentally ambiguous. Understanding human experience, including our own, is never simply a matter of observing it. The elements of experience are understood only through a process that organizes those elements, puts them together, assigns meaning, and prioritizes them. Strategic therapists give clients reframes, or new interpretations, for their experience. Narrative therapists believe that such interpretations won't take unless they fit people's stories. Unlike the cybernetic metaphor, which focused on self-defeating patterns of behavior, the narrative metaphor focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. With the cybernetic metaphor, therapy meant blocking maladaptive interactions. The narrative metaphor, on the other hand, focuses on expanding clients' thinking to allow them to consider alternative ways of looking at themselves and their problems. <br><a data-href="Michael White" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/michael-white.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Michael White</a> was the founder of the narrative movement, based out of Adelaide, Australia (Dulwich Center).

Ideas about how problems affect people - regarding them as something operating on individuals rather than as things people are doing. David Epston, a family therapist from Auckland, New Zealand, is the second most influential leader of the narrative movement. Was known as a storyteller, writing the 'Story Corner' for the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy.
Emphasized that for clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. He fostered the development of self-help 'leagues', groups of clients battling similar problems, such as the Anti-Anorexia /Anti-Bulimia League of New Zealand. He also advocates writing letters to clients, pointing out that long after the influence of the therapist's presence has faded, clients can reread letters that bolster their new stories and resolve.

- The art of analyzing literary texts or human experience, understood as fundamentally ambiguous, by interpreting levels of meaning.
- The truth of experience is not discovered; it's created. The goal of therapy shifted from historical truth to narrative intelligibility. The challenge was to construct truths in the service of self-coherence, not to resurrect a true picture of the past.
- Stories don't just mirror life; they shape it. Narrative therapists believe that problems arise when people are indoctrinated into narrow and self-defeating views of themselves. To counter the way society convinces people they are their problems, narrative therapists externalize problem. Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are encouraged to think of themselves as struggling against their problem; the problem is the problem. Interested in the problem's impact on the family. Michel Foucault (1965, 1980): French social philosopher who devoted his life to exposing how social discourses objectified and dehumanized marginalized groups. Believes not only that those constructing the dominant narrative in a society (those deemed to have expert knowledge) had the power to subjugate but that the narratives themselves became internalized truths, such that people judged their bodies, achievements, and personalities on the basis of standards set by society's judges (doctors, educators, clergy, psychotherapists, politicians, celebrities)
<br>Influence Michael White to take the <a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a> axiom that there are no absolute truths in a political direction, toward deconstructing (reexamining) established truths that oppress people's lives. Narrative therapists have little to say about family dynamics because they reject the idea that families are responsible for the problems of family members. Narrative therapists not only avoid judgements about what is normal but also reject the very idea of categorizing people. Too often in human history, the judgements made by people in power regarding normality and abnormality have been used to subjugate those with no voice in the matter. Family therapists may have trouble seeing their own concepts - such as rigid boundaries, cross-generational coalitions, and enmeshment. Narrative therapists strive to help clients make sense of their own experience. Narrative therapists endeavor to situate themselves with clients; that is, to disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are also encourages to educate therapists regarding their cultural predicaments and to correct them when they make assumptions that don't fit the clients' experience. The basic assumptions narrative therapists make about normal families: People... Have good intentions (they don't need or want problems)
Are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them.
Are not their problems. Can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the culture myths they have internalized. Narrative therapists concentrate on the way individuals narrate their exchange. It's their stories that affect not only what they notice but also how they interpret it. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Such closed and rigid narratives make people vulnerable to being overtaken by destructive emotional states that narrative therapists portray as alien invaders. They do believe that such emotional responses are external in the sense that they are socially constructed. Externalizing problems cuts down on guilt and blame. Narrative therapists do not strive for clinical neutrality. They are active advocates who take sides with their clients and encourage them to see themselves as courageous warriors against the forces that try to trap them in pessimistic mind-sets. Narrative therapists help people separate themselves from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions) to open space for new and more constructive views of themselves. Narrative therapy transforms identities from flawed to preferred, not by getting family members to confront their conflicts but by separating individuals from problems and then uniting the family to fight a common enemy. This is facilitated by combing the family's history for unique outcomes, or times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Narrative therapists help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a>: A postmodern approach to exploring meaning by taking apart and examining taken-for-granted categories and assumptions, making possible newer and sounder constructions of meaning.

Involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience. Narrative therapists use externalizing conversations to help separate persons from problems. This is one way to deconstruct disempowering assumptions. Once a problem has been externalized and redefined in more experience-near terms, an individual can begin to resist it. By viewing the problem as an external entity, narrative therapists free families to challenge its influence on their lives. They also endeavor to shift family members' perceptions of one another from totalizing views, which reduce them to one set of frustrating responses. <br><a data-href="Externalizing Conversations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/externalizing-conversations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Externalizing Conversations</a>: In externalizing conversations, therapists ask effects questions such as, "How does the problem affect you? Your attitudes?" Through this process, the problem's field of influence is broadened so that clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. It is in these areas that clients can notice unique outcomes - experiences that would not be predicted by a telling of the problem story, times when they resisted the problem's influence.
As long as both sides remain fixed in polarized perspectives, they may be too busy to think about their own preferences.

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href="Paul Watzlawick" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href="Richard Fisch" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos.

Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?
Is each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness

Unconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit
Open body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact
Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href="Role of the Symptom" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/role-of-the-symptom.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role of the Symptom</a> in the System <br>Describe how the symptom maintains the family's homeostasis at an emotional level, often regulating closeness and distance (<a data-href="Distance Regulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distance Regulation</a>; <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>) Family Dynamics Identify salient dynamics Power struggles

Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem.

Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns) This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child? Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. The six layers of the iceberg: Behavior The behavior on the surface; the external manifestations of the person's inner world.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. <br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.' The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions.

This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relational, family, or systemic goals
Individual goals The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication: The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.' What do I HEAR and SEE? The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. <br>This is similar to ' <a data-href="videotalk" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href="Solution-Focused Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see? After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. Meanings often connect back to past experiences. What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make? The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: "I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural."; incongruent: "I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.")
Subsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. What DEFENSES do I use? <br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>. What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use? Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'
Most of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques' What is my RESPONSE in the situation? How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?
Incongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change. Satir therapists work with clients to help them express difficult-to-articulate emotions related to the presenting problem. If the clients complain about family members or a difficult life situation, experiential therapists listen closely for the emotions, expressed or unexpressed, that are related to the problem circumstance. They listen not just for the surface emotions, but also for deeper levels of emotion and use questions and empathetic reflections to focus clients on those deeper emotions. If a client tells a story without identifying their emotions directly: "As I listen to you explain what happened to you during that argument, I am getting a sense that you were feeling [name the emotion]. Does that sound right?"
"That sounds like a very difficult situation. Can you share some of the emotions you have been expeirencing as you go through this?" If a client does identify emotions, the therapy can help explore them with questions such as: "You say you were feeling [emotion]. I am wondering if part of you is also feeling [name another emotion that client seems to be experiencing]."
"Can you say more about what feeling [name emotion] feels like for you." Satir coached families in softening rigid family rules by changing them to guidelines. For example, rather than saying "I should not get angry," a client or family was encouraged to revise the limiting rule to "What I am angry, I will express my anger in a way that is respectful to others and myself." Satir encouraged families to have as few rules as possible and to be flexible, adapting them for each context and as children's developmental needs change. <br>Coaching clients in how to have authentic, congruent communication in session, involves the ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' combined with specific communication coaching strategies. When coaching communication, Satir had clients turn their chairs toward one another and gave the clients prompts, such as, "Tell your partner how you feel about what happened on Saturday night." If the client was able to congruently address their partner about this, Satir then prompted the partner to respond in kind, continuing this process until the problem was resolved. When a person had trouble communicating congruently and reverted to a survival stance, Satir interrupted the conversation and suggested how to rephrase the statement or how to make the client's nonverbal communication more congruent (e.g., "Now, can you say that starting the statement with 'I' instead of 'you'?" or "Can you show me the emotion you say you are feeling when you speak to your wife?")

Sculpting involves putting family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family. Either the therapist or the client may direct the sculpting. If family members are directing the sculpting, each person in the family is given the opportunity to sculpt the family as they see it. Sometimes the sculptor assigns each family member to say a line that represents how they may be feeling, thinking, or viewing the situation. Usually, however, the essence of this intervention is to give a nonverbal, symbolic depiction of the family process from each person's perspective. Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses. Through the sculpting process, a person is able to literally see how they are contributing to the problematic family process far more quickly than when the same information is provided with words. When all family members are sculpting, it is generally best to let all family members sculpt how they see the family before allowing discussion of one another's sculpting. Therapists encourage family members to respect each person's subjective experience as illustrated in the sculpting and to use the experience to deepen their understanding of one another. Satir used touch in therapy to initially connect with clients and to encourage and reassure them when they were practicing new ways of communicating. In this way, she underscored emotional context and provided palpable support. She also used touch with children to help teach alternatives to violent behavior and to model for parents how to manage difficult children. In today's practicing environments, touching is generally discouraged because it can easily be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or may make a client feel uncomfortable. Therapists need to carefully consider the legal and ethical issues of using touch. Touch may be appropriate in certain practice and cultural contexts. At minimum, therapists can learn from Satir the importance of coaching clients in touching each other - their children and spouses - in more loving and helpful ways. For example, rather than using a demonstration, therapists can guide a parent on how to hold children who are having a tantrum. <br>A form of psychodrama, the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> is used to allow clients to explore unresolved family issues and life events in the safety of the group setting. <br>The client, who is called the ' <a data-href="Star" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Star</a> ,' first identifies key events in their life chronology and significant sources of influence.

In this way, the therapist facilitates a process in which the client is better able to accept different aspects of the self and to identify the contexts in which these aspects have been and continue to be useful. The language of 'parts' can also be used to facilitate similar discussions and insights in individual, couples, and family therapy.

Title: Protective Factors for Adverse Childhood Experiences: The Role of Emotion Regulation and Attachment, Author: Tanner, Mackenzie A.; Francis, Sarah E.; Journal: Journal of Child and Family Studies, Year: 2025 DOI: 10.1007/s10826-024-02989-7

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents‚Äô development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n = 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difÔ¨Åculties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.

In this week's spotlight for attractions, we have Ohio History Connection (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" target="_self">https://www.ohiohistory.org/Links to an external site.</a>)!&nbsp;The Ohio History Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society, is a statewide history organization with the mission to spark discovery of Ohio‚Äôs stories. As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state‚Äôs history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;<br>For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://mozartscafe.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://mozartscafe.com/" target="_self">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart‚Äôs brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This "taste of Austria" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most "brilliantly illuminated city in the country." Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days. The leaves are falling! Where does the time go.&nbsp;Have a wonderful week, and please reach out to myself or Anna, our TA, if you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerAnother week, another (late) announcement,I hope you are having a great week, we are halfway through, whether that's the semester or the week you decide! This week we will begin to look at the basic patterns of sexual orientation and behavior. We also look at the critiques on sexual attitudes, sex education, and the sexual double standard. By the end of this module, you will be able to answer some questions such as...
What is sexual orientation? How have attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the medical and scientific communities?
According to researchers, what is the role of genetics, evolution, and social environment in determining sexual orientation?
REMINDER: Please put aside enough time to watch 'How to Lose Your Virginity' (1 hour and 6 minutes) and 'Sex 101' (20 min).&nbsp;<br>In this week's restaurant, I chose Belle's Bread.&nbsp;Tucked away in the Japanese marketplace located on Kenny Centre Mall,&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" target="_self">Belle‚Äôs BreadLinks to an external site.</a>&nbsp;is a family-owned and -operated, French-inspired Japanese bakery. Takashi Takenaka opened the business after immigrating from Japan in 1972, and he pays homage to childhood treats with his red bean roll, frank roll, and curry and boiled egg doughnuts. The bear-shaped strawberry cream bun is all over social media, but the best-kept secret is the Mont Blanc roll with its layers of delicate, airy sweet cream and chestnuts.&nbsp;<br>In Columbus Lore this week, our amazing student Doug Motz wrote this piece on the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" title="Link" href="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" target="_self">AIU &amp; The LeVeque TowerLinks to an external site.</a>. I learned so much information from this article, and it is just one piece of history from our city. Please take a moment to read through this article, if you get the chance. You know that big building that has those beautiful lights displayed at the top? Yup, that's this place! It has gone through it's fair share of history, and many owners. Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!! Just a wonderful piece of history to share with you all.&nbsp;Go outside and play in the leaves, take a moment to breathe. You have done so well, and I am so proud of you! Keep working hard as you always have, and remember to take care of yourself this week. :)Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerGoooooooood Evening Buckeyes!

On this week's Columbus lore, I thought I would bring it a little closer to home and look into OSU's history. You know that beautiful building you most likely walk by regularly called University Hall? Well, do I have some interesting facts for you.This was the first classroom building opened in 1873!&nbsp;<br>

On the first day of classes in September 1873, the students entered an unfinished University Hall. This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.<br>In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today‚Äôs University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today‚Äôs University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/" target="_self">https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/Links to an external site.</a>)For a random Columbus restaurant, I wanted something close to campus. I chose Emmett's Cafe! This bakery/cafe is located in the Old North.&nbsp;Inspired by Australian coffee culture, Emmett‚Äôs is the top pick for morning hangouts with a flat white or cold brew. This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks. Get that pumpkin spice latte for yourself, you deserve that treat! I can't wait to see the leaves falling all over campus.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn Ash (Lynn Reidinger)Hey Class,I apologize for missing our weekly announcement last week, but I was unfortunately not feeling well. We can't skip this week, what if some of you are waiting on this week's Columbus lore? As always, I will have interesting history, activities, and suggested restaurants below.You worked through your midterm, WOO! I am so proud of each of you for getting to this point in the semester. I can't believe we are almost finished. It has been a pleasure getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to each of you that congratulated me on my marriage, and this week seems very fitting!This week we look at marriage and cohabitation. Be mindful as we reflect on diversity, inequality, and social change in terms of marriage. We will consider how marital quality changes across the life course and illustrate the hallmarks of poor marital communication. Do you know what are the predictors of a high quality, satisfying marriage? What specific relationships come to mind when you think of a healthy marriage?This week's assignments are outlined below. As always, we accept your assignments 24-hours late with a 2-point deduction on your essays and discussions, and a 1-point deduction for your weekly reflections. We are unable to accept your InQuizitive quizzes late.&nbsp;Please read:

Originally, there was no formal plan for an Oval. The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps ‚ÄúThe Five Brothers,‚Äù which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" target="_self">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!<br><img alt="Announcements-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png" target="_self">
Anthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony‚Äôs dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony‚Äôs son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony‚Äôs Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father.

It‚Äôs okay, neither did I. These friendly, relaxed-looking deer were added to the Scioto Mile as part of the big rehabilitation project in 2014 that&nbsp;turned the area into the incredible multi-use park and trail space it is now.There are a total of three deer along the Scioto River admiring the river, and they were put in during the renovation. Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don‚Äôt worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;I hope you all have a great week. I should be on tomorrow for our office hours if you may need anything (My office hours are Tuesdays from 1p-2p). Please take some time this week to soak in some sun and enjoy this fall weather. You have worked so hard to get to this point!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshIT'S HALLOWEEN!!!This is my favorite holiday, and it makes me so happy to see people dressed up while walking around campus. Make sure to grab some candy for yourself (... getting it on sale tomorrow does in fact count), and take it easy this week. This week's topic some of you may already have some experience with, whether directly or indirectly, parenting. We will analyze societal expectations and attitudes around parenthood and childlessness. We will also look at concepts of intensive motherhood, helicopter parenting, and co-parenting.&nbsp;REMINDERS:InQuizitive (Chapter 9): 11/1Discussion (Intensive Parenting): 11/3Essay 9: 11/5Reflection 9: 11/5<br>On this week's Columbus lore, we are back on campus with my personal favorite:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" target="_self">Mirror Lake</a><br>

It is very fitting to choose this wonderful place as our topic for Columbus Lore. The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!‚ÄúAnnouncements-9.png‚Äù could not be found.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" target="_self">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a>On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn‚Äôs products.Astounding Activities:&nbsp;‚ÄúAnnouncements-10.png‚Äù could not be found.<br>For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" target="_self">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape.

Mr. Ted has been coming to campus with me, so if you ever see us walking by don't be afraid to say hi!Have a fantastic week!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHi Buckeyes!Though we are not covering anything this week, I wanted to send an announcement out to all of you regarding the event that will take place for each of you tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHappy Tuesday everyone!Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life. We discuss examples of implicit bias and microaggressions and how they impact the individual and family.&nbsp;<br>We will be reading Chapter 3 in Cohen (2020) this week, which is posted under the top module labelled '<a title="Textbook Information" class="internal-link" data-href="/courses/180658/modules/1814602" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Textbook Information</a>.' You will also be taking a look at a few videos on racism and microaggressions.&nbsp;Things to keep in mind for this week:

Questions for both: What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?
Can you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?
What role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?
Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy? Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first): Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. (Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)
Ask them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement. Now work with the leaning-in partner: Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. Summary statement: Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?
What do you think the problem is now?
How will you know when the problem is solved?
How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today? So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen? What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?
What changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? How have you managed to cope, ensure, keep going? What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?
On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope? Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. How were you hoping I could help you?
Asking for clients' perceptions
Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
Is this conversation useful? How is it useful? Who is in charge, the person or the problem? Reading between the lines of the problem story
Can you remember a time... What does it say about you... If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
Who benefits from the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
Is the problem always with you? What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict... ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/questions-for-clients.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Questions for Clients.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:13:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Preparing for Co-Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Before each session co-therapists should have a pre-session meeting. Therapists pre-session so that co-therapists are on the same page. During pre-sessioning you should decide on the following: The intention or goals for the session
Agreement on a theoretical model
Create a session specific game plan
Discuss previous sessions, hypotheses, and evaluation of progress
Make decisions about next steps in treatment You should also consider the following questions amongst yourself: What would blow you out of the water?
What would be so shocking that you wouldn't know what to do?
Let's brainstorm what we would do if XYZ occurred in session Examples (arguing, escalation, high conflict, desire to end relationship, risk, etc.) How would you manage that?
What do you anticipate?
What is your theory of what's going on--your theory of the problem? Strategies for the therapy room As a co-therapy team you should determine which strategies you are going to use in the room. What is the role of each therapist and how will you work together. Some strategies to consider: Tag team One starts speaking, while the other would be writing questions, and perhaps nodding occasionally, or making validating and summarizing statements.
Then, when number one (i.e. the one who was speaking) runs out number two is ready. They're ready, because they've been writing questions, and they can jump in with those questions. Preparation and sharing airtime Who will do what in the session? Who is handling assessment or genogram?
Will we ever spend time one on one or break up subsystems of the client system?
Split the joining tasks
Before you go into the room, you decide which member of the couple each therapist will focus on with joining. For example: You're going to join with the husband, and I'm going to join with the wife.
It's very specific who we're each validating, empathizing, and summarizing. If you start asking questions of the husband, it's my job to ask the follow-up questions of the wife. In the same vein with the wife, so that we're like two advocates. Reflecting Team As co-therapists there may be times when you find it appropriate to turn to one another and talk about what is going on or what you notice in the room. This could be used as an intervention or to help determine the next steps in the session.
Example: Co-therapists turn to one another and debate or argue about what is happening with the client system. Have a discussion or debate about what is going on, and then turn back to the couple and say, "Where are we going wrong?, or "How are we getting it right?" ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Preparing for Co-Therapy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:13:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ECR-SF Scoring]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Results consist of two scores for the two separate factors; Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. The minimum score for each scale is 7 and a maximum score of 42. In addition, scores are represented in terms of percentile ranks compared to a normative sample. A percentile of 50 represents typical (and healthy) attachment, whereas higher percentiles represent more difficulties with adult attachment compared to peers.
Attachment avoidance is defined as involving fear of dependence and interpersonal intimacy, an excessive need for self-reliance, and reluctance to self-disclose.
Attachment anxiety is defined as involving a fear of interpersonal rejection or abandonment, an excessive need for approval from others, and distress when one‚Äôs partner is unavailable or unresponsive.
People who score high on either or both of these dimensions are assumed to have an insecure adult attachment orientation. By contrast, people with low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance can be viewed as having a secure adult attachment orientation (Brennan et al., 1998). In addition, higher scores are significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, interpersonal distress, or loneliness.

Why are couples behaving so badly? "The average couple waits 6 years before seeking out therapy." (Gottman) In those 6 years there is: Build up of resentments
Reinforced bad habits
No boundary enforcement
Erosion of positive perspective
Unconscious bias kicks - assumptions about purposeful poor behavior choices
Missed bids for attention
Depletion of emotional bank account
Never had any positive role models to begin with From a survey conducted in September 2020: Increases in substance misuse: Alcohol (88%)
Marijuana (37%)
Prescription Opioids (15%) Domestic violence cases increased by 25%-33% globally. How are these influences showing up in the clients in the therapy room? Passive/aggressive behaviors
Shut down/Withdrawn/Stonewalling
Withholding Sex or Avoiding Intimacy
Narcissistic Behavior Responses
Gaslighting
Anger
High Conflict
Boundary Crossing
Persistent and Ongoing Flooding
Unwilling to Repair/Apologize/Take Responsibility How to prepare yourself for the unexpected: When you open your office door, look for body language and non-verbals. Have confidence and KNOW that you are the expert in the room. Own it and be brave. Set the tone at the beginning of the session when you feel something is off. Let the clients know what you feel when you feel it, and be willing to talk about what is happening. (Do not wait for clients to bring it up or ignore it)
Model for your couples that you are going to talk about it, not let things be passive-aggressive or avoid dealing with hot topics. Remind clients who escalate that they are not in therapy to repeat old patterns. Pause and interrupt when you see unacknowledged emotion happening in the room. That is your job. Don't let your couples argue or verbally explode on each other. They can do that at home for free. Take Control. Develop your phrase to create stop-action with clients. Say things like, 'pause, stop,' or call out your client's name, etc. Be direct. What is acceptable and what is not acceptable about words or behavior in the room. What you would like your clients to do instead (as for their positive need). Why it's not okay for them to say or do the thing that you witnessed in the room. Let the clients know how painful it is for you to witness, so you can't imagine what it's like for their partner. Keep your eyes on each client in the room. Are you letting one partner high jack the session? Stop the speaking partner and ask, 'What's coming up for you?' Notice if the other partner checks in. Be mindful of the need to stop and tend to the party not speaking. This is how you keep explosions from getting out of control because you have been checking in on what is happening on the other side of the couch. Step in for clients when they don't have words and find a way to speak their pain to their partner. Keep it fair, so both partners feel you are connected with their pain, needs, and wanted outcomes. Normalize high emotion and disappointment of partner not being able to acknowledge perspectives not because they don't love you. Differences on family of origin, difference in expectations, etc. Prior traumas and life experiences make it hard for partners to always regulate their emotions in ways they would hope. Untreated mental health issues impact ability to manage emotions. Not finished working on the 'Me' stuff versus the 'We' stuff and bleeding over into our relationship. Discuss the impact of substances and the impact it has on being able to manage emotions. Gottman Method: Flooding is expected because partners are experiencing physiological arousal. Utilize pulse oximeters to help validate their elevated heart rate. Be okay with breaking it up. Sometimes you need to have one couple leave the room while you do some one-on-one with the other partner. Let an explosive partner leave if they want. Don't chase them or try to convince them to stay or come back. Talk about the flooding in the room and share ways to help self-regulate, like taking deep breaths or pausing to find ways to reframe. You need to be prepared when working with couples that you might need to a break from couples therapy or stop all together based on how the clients present. This is your call as a therapist to evaluate if working with the couple is contraindicated because of co-occurring mental health, substance, unresolved trauma, suicidal ideation, personality disorders, characterological DV, or anger management issues. Often necessary to request that clients seek out individual therapy to strengthen their individual coping skills before attempting additional couples' therapy. Expect your clients to disagree and give you pushback. Attitude is everything in this conversation. Remember, your clients are not your peers, and we often have to make unpopular decisions about the course of care. When you feel anxious and flooded as the therapist: Notice where you are breathing. Plant both feet on the floor. Take your shoulders back against your chair, take a deep breath into your belly, and repeat to yourself: "This is not my pain to feel." Get in touch with your client's inner 5-year-old old in the room. What is hurting them, and what is the catastrophe scenario that is playing out for them?
When I de-escalate, so do my clients. When my voice gets softer and quieter, so does my clients, and they can often match my tone and calm demeanor. Don't shy away from acknowledging they have the right to feel upset, and it makes sense they would be even if their partner does not agree. Ask their partner to find something they said that they can validate for their partner. Remind them this is not the same as agreeing. Focus on the behavior or the words you heard. We can help facilitate meaningful conversation about the emotions each partner is feeling. Ask the partner who is feeling a big emotion related to their partner to name their emotion. Then talk the behavior they say their partner do or the words they heard them say. Remind and monitor clients to avoid telling their partner their evaluation of why their partner did it or the mind set they were in when it happened. This often happens and only creates defensiveness in their partner. No one likes to be told how they feel. Ask for your positive need. Even if the answer is no - you need to hear yourself asking for your need. Gottman Method Stress Reducing Conversation 10-minutes each partner. Listening for understanding and share emotion. (Not problem-solving)
How do clients know it's working? Does your partner feel hear and understood? Then yes. Use of open-ended questions to help partners attune, connect, and provide empathy and support. Questions that allow for each partner to draw out their partner's experience, such as: "What is this like for you? What do you need? What don't you like about this situation?" Gottman Method Dreams within Conflict Asks clients to suspend problem-solving so they can have a better understanding of the childhood stories, values, or core ethics and beliefs that keep their partner rooted in their perspective. Clients take turns asking each partner a set of questions so they can better experience what it's like to walk in their partner's shoes. Preparation for compromise like partners who love each other. Gottman Method Injuries Exercise Helps partners find a structured and safe format to talk about old injuries in a way that helps facilitate compassion, acceptance, and understand about prior and shared traumas.
Creates awareness and insight about the impact and ways these traumas have shaped the way each partner views their world.
Helps evaluate how clients have learned to cope and survive. Can help some clients gain insight on how they behave in relationships in ways that no longer serve them.
Helps couples therapist normalize and make recommendations of ways those old injuries get triggered in the relationship and behavior changes that might be beneficial. Gottman Method Appreciations Exercise Changes tone and energy in session.
Allows each partner to find something positive to notice about their partner to demonstrate holding each other from a positive perspective.
Makes deposits into each partner‚Äôs emotional bank account.
Starts conversations about how to do small things often in the relationship for highly disconnected couples.
Way to end session, so couples can ground before leaving in turmoil. If apologies are made, they are often expressed as implying you misunderstood something but without remorse for poor behaviors
Outside behaviors or the other person is ALWAYS the source of conflict or turn it around on the other person implying they are really the culprit for the issue
Self-doubt creeps in and the partner being gaslit internalizes their lack of hard work in the relationship as the cause of all the problems.
Guilt develops about bringing up issues in the relationship.
It feels very much like the result of narcissistic behavior responses.
The partner who is doing the gaslighting may do so unconsciously to gain control or power in the relationship when they feel out of resources or support.
Manipulation that involves making someone question their own reality, feelings, and experiences of events, in order to maintain CONTROL over that person. Deflecting the other person by use of lack of acknowledgement, negative body language, and minimizing statements about the other person‚Äôs perspective or feelings. Unwillingness to accept any part of the responsibility for a misunderstanding or conflict. Intentional implication that the other person is over-reacting or has fabricated a situation in order to create doubt or challenge the other person‚Äôs reality Being cut off from making points, asking questions, or providing input during a disagreement. No acknowledgment of your hurt feelings when expressed. Lacks Empathy.
Clients are often overly invested in using narcissist label with each other. Only 5% of population are diagnosable with narcissistic personality disorder
You should be aware that most clients who have diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder are not going to be served in couples therapy and may be contra-indicated. Gottman Interventions to Bring into Session Introduces the idea that anything our partner does for us is a gift - they are not required to do so because we are in a relationship with each other.
Softened Start Up: This is helpful for the narcissistic leaning partner to learn how to be clear in their needs and learn how to share why it is important to them. This helps them to slowly understand they are not entitled to anything. Appreciations: Help the narcissistic partner to think about what the other person adds to their life and to acknowledge it. Accept the things you can't change. Helpful for both partners to understand there are some things that are unlikely to ever completely be different in their dynamics. Helps partners make a choice about the relationship from that space of acceptance. Aftermath of a Regrettable Incident: Introduction to Narcissistic person about their role in feeling disrespected or unappreciated. Active listening exercises like the Gottman-Rapport You must interrupt patterns of rage, repeated interruptions, storming off, or screaming. Be on the lookout for a partner who has NPD to be overly charming or makes big declarations of victimhood, or says their only goal is ‚Äúto fight for the relationship.‚Äù Avoid becoming a victim of triangulation or becoming caught up in buying into the hope that you can fix the narcissistic behaviors. You MUST be comfortable being direct, holding a strong position of authority in the room, and be willing to call out poor behavior that is impacting the relationship. Strongly suggest and sometimes require that both partners be in individual therapy and check in with this therapist to make sure they are aware of the dynamics happening in the relationship. The only goal you may accomplish is validating the victim that they are correct in their reality and that they can trust their intuition. You may serve as the objective voice this person needs to get clear and end the relationship. Don‚Äôt fight, argue, or try to overpower the narcissist.
There is a very strong likelihood that despite your support that these sessions may not go as you hope! Many clients who have narcissistic behaviors can and will use the tools they learn in session to abuse, further manipulate, or weaponize against their partner. True NPD will NOT be ok with the change in or loss of power and will retaliate. Evaluate if the partner is becoming more agitated, aggressive, and if you suspect there is an increased likelihood for physical abuse-stop sessions. Recognize you can and potentially should take a break from therapy with the couples. Should you refer them to seek individual therapy for a while and then re-evaluate if they are good candidates for couples therapy? Couples therapy can re-traumatize the partner who is being victimized. Consider if this is in the scope of your practice? Do you need to refer out? Make time before letting clients go to let them know that it was a hard session and how important it was to have it. Let your partner know that if they are flooded when they will come back and talk about it with you. Make a date with each other to come back and process. Check in with each partner about what they will do to self-soothe. Remind clients that emotions and feeling hurt or misunderstood happens in relationships. The couple is not in this situation because they don‚Äôt love each other but because the stakes are so high. This is your person and if we are not ok then nothing feels ok. Let them know you are proud of them for doing the work.

Increase understanding of the prevalence, characteristics and impact of trauma on individuals. Understand the neurobiology of trauma and how the stress response system impacts functioning. Identity and apply trauma-informed strategies for deescalating crisis situations and working with people who are emotionally distressed. An event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects. Abuse, neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, incarceration of family members, family substance abuse, sudden or expected loss of a loved one Exposure to war, political violence, torture, forced displacement, migration and acculturation stressors, fears of deportation Pain, injury and serious illness; invasive medical procedures or treatments Lack of resources, support networks, or mobility; financial stressors; homelessness Hurricanes, fires, floods Accidents, wars, environmental disasters, acts of terrorism Robberies, shootings, assault, gang-related violence, hate crimes, group trauma affecting a particular community Threats, fights, school shootings, bullying, loss of a student or staff member Exposure to multiple traumatic events from an early age.
The immediate and long-term effects of these experiences over development. "The cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations, including the lifespan, which emanates from massive group trauma." (Braveheart)
Examples: American Indian and Alaskan Native communities
Communities of color
Holocaust survivors
Japanese-American survivors of internment camps
LGBTQ communities Potentially traumatic experiences resulting from: Direct experiences of racial harassment
Witnessing racial violence toward others
Experiencing discrimination and institutional racism A single traumatic event that is limited in time Experiencing multiple traumatic events Exposure to chronic trauma which impacts the child's development Usually caused by adults entrusted with the child's care NORMAL response/reaction to stress and even trauma (4-6 weeks) Exaggerated and prolonged stress response beyond 4-6 weeks and even years later Dysregulation of stress chemistry - stress hormone levels don't decrease
Increased activation of Sympathetic Nervous System (heart rate, startle response, fight response) 70% of adults in the US have experienced some types of traumatic event at least once in their lives. 223.4 million people In public behavioral health, over 90% of clients have experienced trauma.
Trauma is a risk factor in nearly all behavioral health and substance use disorders. Collaboration between the CDC and Kaiser Permanente study of over 17,000 adult patients in health maintenance organizations (1995-1997); 2 waves of data collection
Gathers information about health history and exposure to the following events prior to age 18: Recurrent physical abuse
Recurrent emotional abuse
Sexual abuse
An alcohol or drug abuser
An incarcerated household member
Someone who is chronically depressed, suicidal, institutionalized or mentally ill
Mother being treated violently
One or no parents
Emotional or physical neglect ‚ÄúHow ACEs influence health and wellbeing through lifespan.png‚Äù could not be found. Nearly two-thirds Ohioans have been exposed to ACEs
Ohioans more likely to experience multiple ACEs: People of color
People with low-income
People with a disability
Residents of urban and Appalachian counties Stress: Unpredictable, Severe, Prolonged -&gt; Vulnerability
Predictable, Moderate, Controlled -&gt; Resilience Natural response to the prolonged uncertainty and disruption caused by a pandemic Lack of motivation
Stress over tasks that would generally be managed well
Changes in eating or sleeping habits
Irritability
Feelings of hopelessness
Difficulty concentrating At any given point in time, we have a limited supply of 'adaptive energy'
In the best of conditions, this reservoir is quite high and will allow us to meet unusual challenges
Chronic and prolonged stress related to COVID-19 and other stressors has depleted the reservoir of adaptive energy, making us all more vulnerable to stress. The amygdala senses threat and sets off the alarm. Thinking brain assess the situation. Thinking brain goes offline. Emotional brain activates fight or flight response. Thinking brain helps shut off the alarm and helps us to calm down. An experience becomes traumatic when it overwhelms our system for responding to stress. The emotional brain continues to sound the alarm and send messages to fight or flee, even after the threat has passed. Autonomic Nervous System: Direct role in physical response to stress. Sympathetic Nervous System: 'Fight or flight' response
Body shifts energy resources toward fighting off or fleeing a threat
Signals release of adrenaline and cortisol
Heart beats faster, respiration rate increases, blood vessels in arms and legs dilate, digestive process changes, glucose levels in blood (sugar energy) increase Parasympathetic Nervous System: Facilitates recovery once acute stressor is over
Over-activity can contribute to stress reactions Chronic stress can result in a long-term drain on the body Wear and tear
Continuous activation of the nervous system can be problematic in all systems. Musculoskeletal System: Muscles in body are in constant state of guardedness Muscle tension, headaches, migraines, back pain Respiratory System Shortness of breath
Rapid breathing Cardiovascular System Elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, elevated stress hormones, inflammation Endocrine System Increased production of cortisol Gastrointestinal System Changes in gut bacteria, pain, bloating, discomfort Esophagus Eat more or less than usual, increased use of substances, heartburn/acid reflux History of previous exposure to trauma
Age of exposure Gender
Cognitive ability
Self-efficacy
Biological factors (e.g. flexibility in thinking, emotional regulation) Nature of the traumatic event
Proximity to the traumatic event
Culture and ethnicity
Level of social support
Quality of parent-child relationships, parent mental health, and parental history of trauma
Health of the broader community Positive: Resilience A positive, adaptive response to significant adversity. Adaptable, caring, and supportive relationship with an adult. A sense of mastery over life circumstances. Strong executive function and self-regulation skills.
Affirming faith or cultural traditions Individuals may demonstrate resilience in one type of situation but not another. Coping skills that support resilience can be developed at any age. Children do not develop the capacity to positive adapt to adversity in isolation. Regardless of resources, individuals who face extreme adversity are likely to be significantly impacted. We all play an important role in fostering resilience. Recovery
Post-traumatic growth Negative: Severe persisting distress
Decline
Stable maladaptive functioning We need to presume the clients we serve have a history of traumatic stress and exercise ‚Äúuniversal precautions‚Äù by creating systems of care that are trauma-informed. Understanding trauma and its impact
Promoting safety
Ensuring cultural competence
Supporting control, choice, autonomy
Collaboration and mutuality
Integrating care
Healing happens in relationships
Recovery is possible Bringing a volatile and potentially explosive situation to a peaceful, calm resolution by verbal means... and no one getting hurt.

Person kept waiting? Ignored?
Objects around that could be used for violence?
Open path to exit? Think and plan ahead Be familiar with agency policies/procedures
Develop plans for 'high risk' clients in advance Develop plans for common scenarios based on your role, department, program, etc. Monitor and manage your own stress level Clients in crisis require structure and boundaries to help re-establish stability
Engaging client in discussion (repeated concerns can inadvertently contribute to chaos and triangulation; following the identified plan is the best way to support and care for these clients)
Parallel Process: Don't get pulled into the chaos
Setting firm, clear boundaries creates safety and minimizes potential for triangulation and miscommunication Identifying single point of contact for clients help ensure we have clear, consistent communication and avoids potential for triangulation People are doing the best they can to get their needs met
Escalation is likely a learned behavior
Be PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE Attend to person before things escalate Stage 1: Anxiety/Agitation
Stage 2: Argumentative/Defensive
Stage 3: Verbally, Physically Threatening
Stage 4: Assaultive The more threatened the individual, the more 'primitive' (or regressed) becomes the style of thinking and behaving. When a traumatized person is in a state of alarm: They will be less capable of concentrating
They will be more anxious
They will pay more attention to non-verbal cues Tone of voice, body posture, and facial expressions Trigger: Any stimulus that acts as a reminder of past overwhelming experience Internal: Body sensations, emotions, etc. External: Sounds, sights, smells, facial expressions, etc. Common triggers: Unpredictability, sudden change, transitions
Loss of control
Feeling vulnerable
Feeling rejected
Confrontation
Loneliness
Sensory overload
Intimacy (safety, love, security, family)
Peace, calm, quiet 'Re-Experiencing' can lead to out-of-control behavior When someone with a trauma history begins to escalate, it may be because they are remembering or re-experiencing a traumatic event
They may be reminded of the trauma and be flooded or overwhelmed with memories of that earlier traumatic event. Remember your superpowers: Body language Facial expression
Posture
Position Tone of voice
Active listening Calm and caring attitude
Ask for help Someone who is escalated is under stress and not likely to think clearly
Your perception of your ability to cope with the situation is going to impact your own stress level when managing these interactions
De-escalation skills start with self-awareness. Understanding how stress affects how you act, think, and communicate Speak in a calm, slow, warm, clear voice
Show that you care
Be aware of your non-verbal communication
Acknowledge feelings
Maintain eye contact (but don't stare)
You may need to repeat yourself; the client may be distracted
Be patient; give the situation time; time is on your side
Remain a friendly tone and join with the client Helps the client see that you and the client are a team
"We are going to figure this out" Allow the client to vent ("Tell me more about that")
Use 'Please' and 'thank you' often
Accept the client's feelings, thoughts and behaviors without judgement Remember that most of us have been irrational and said inappropriate things when we are under extreme stress Effective communication often depends as much on how you say the words you choose as much as the words themselves
Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings
Alert others, if needed
Evaluate each situation for violence
Keep an open path
Remove yourself/others if situation is getting out of control Open up clear lines of communication
Build trust and validate the client's situation (even if you don't agree)
Get the client talking about concerns as a route to calming
Gather the necessary information to make a good resolution If a client is escalated, they feel out of control which tells us that their normal coping measures are not working
Keep your focus. You are trying to give the client a sense that they are in control. When someone feels out of control, they are more likely to escalate Your ability to engage a client in conversation successfully can resolve the conflict
If it seems you may not get there, ask for help Shows interest
Close-ended questions may be necessary but client is more likely to tell you what you want to hear
"What can I help you with today?" vs. "Do you want to schedule an appointment?"
"What time of day works best for you?" vs. "Can you come at 2 pm?"
"Can you tell me..." Being expressively/explicitly kind
Builds rapport and nurtures competence "I appreciate you telling me what's wrong."
"It took a lot of courage for you to reach out today."
"You've done a great job of keeping your appointments in the past. We really appreciate that." Validates and shows you‚Äôve heard the client
Mirror back what you‚Äôre hearing is going on ‚Ä¢ Allow further explanation of the concern by not inserting your opinion
Listen for feelings, themes, motivations, unmet need ‚ÄúIt sounds like you‚Äôve had a really tough time.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really angry about what‚Äôs happened.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ____.‚Äù Insert any emotion‚Äî‚Äúmad,‚Äù ‚Äúupset,‚Äù ‚Äúfrustrated,‚Äù ‚Äúworried,‚Äù etc. You can‚Äôt do it wrong! ‚ÄúSounds like‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúSeems like‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúIt feels like‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúTo you, it looks like‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúI am hearing‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúI am wondering if‚Ä¶‚Äù Help transition the client to resolution: ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been through a lot and you‚Äôre really upset about everything that‚Äôs happened before. It sounds like we need to get you in to talk to someone. Would it be okay to get you scheduled for an appointment?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe last time you were here, you thought you got the run around and didn‚Äôt have time to see the provider. You were really frustrated by all that. How about if we get you scheduled again and see if we can get things resolved?‚Äù Remember the overall goal - client care
If you take a LESS authoritative, LESS controlling, LESS confrontational approach, you actually will have MORE control in the situation. Responding angrily
Not listening
Criticizing
Being defensive
Arguing with the client
Engaging in power struggles
Ordering the client what to do Threatening (to cancel an appointment, etc.)
Minimizing the importance of the client's concern
Moving quickly (can be perceived as aggressive) Saying "You need to calm down"
Trying to be right
Giving commands "lower your voice" Arguing with the client
Taking the words or actions of the client personally (even if the client tries to make it personal)
Minimizing the situation ("It is not that bad")
Asking a lot of questions
Asking 'Why' questions
Forcing discussion Do not express anger, impatience, or irritation Breathe
Take a moment away, if possible Never use inflammatory language ("You are acting crazy")
Notice if you are feeling as though you have to rush or feeling like you are stuck if it takes time to get to work through the client interaction Breathe through it, be patient
Request help, if needed Don't intervene too quickly or try too hard to control the interaction by interrupting or talking over the client Follow agency policy Document Debrief Strategies to manage/avoid similar situations in future What went well? What didn't go well?
Did anything contribute to the escalation?
Did anything help diffuse the situation? Support for staff, clients, and individuals involved People are coping the best way they can - our job is to help them find a better way
Requires building trust, creating safety, and creating a trauma informed culture that provides a safe and healing environment
Healing takes more than therapy Support services can create therapeutic, healing experiences - a place of safety Screen for trauma history
Deepen attunement skills - learn to interpret behavior effectively as communication
Employ person-centered, strengths-based thinking and language
Provide stability and empowerment
Consider the physiological, psychological, and social risks of physical interventions - choose the least restrictive option as a last resort if somebody is a danger to themselves or others
Prioritize debriefing after a crisis to help foster resilience and develop successful coping skills Be empathetic and non-judgemental
Respect personal space
Use non-threatening non-verbals
Avoid overreacting
Focus on feelings
Ignore challenging questions
Set limits
Choose wisely what you insist upon
Allow silence for reflection
Allow time for decisions

The acute phase of a suicidal crisis is when a person is ready to actually make an attempt to end their life. Suicidal crises are often brief. While some attempts follow a long period of deliberation, other attempts are acted on hastily and may be difficult to predict. Most people who attempt suicide don't necessarily want to be dead, but they want the pain they feel to stop. Most people who attempt suicide and survive do not ultimately kill themselves - even people who make a very serious suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Crisis: The period when a person transitions from being at risk for suicide or considering suicide to being ready to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;make an attempt. Can come on rapidly
Can be difficult to predict
Can lead to an unplanned suicide attempt
People were asked when they has first started thinking about making an attempt; 48% said they starting thinking about it within 10 minutes of attempting. Often brief The period during which a person is actually ready to take their life is usually brief. Rarely is it a chronic state. The impulse to die often fades. It may never recur, or it may flare up episodically. Duration of Suicidal Crisis: Evidence by Attempters: 0-10 minutes: 48%
11-60 minutes: 2%
1-24 hours: 9%
1-7 days: 16%
1-4 weeks: 15%
1-12 months: 11% Long-Term Survival: More than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not actually kill themselves. 60% of people who commit suicide die on their first attempt. (Means reduction saves lives by decreasing the likelihood that an attempt will be fatal) In describing the moment he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, Ken Baldwin said, "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped." It is not easy to determine. Examples: Clients who have suicidal thoughts. Clients who are in distress and have attempted suicide in the past. Clients who are struggling with mental health or substance misuse issues, especially if they are also coping with painful life crises. A clinician should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and feelings. Talking about suicide does not create or increase risk, in fact, it can reduce the risk of suicide. A clinician‚Äôs ability to calmly, compassionately, and matter-of-factly explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors may encourage an individual to disclose suicidality, if it exists. Often, clients who have considered suicide will be relieved that you raised the subject. Use direct questions about current or past suicidal thoughts and behavior. Let the client know that other people have similar thoughts and feelings.
Any of your clients who have a prior history of suicidality or current distress could benefit from lethal means counseling. If your conversation with your client results in disclosure of past suicidal thoughts or behaviors, probe more about current suicidal feelings. Find out specific details about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Some Questions to Ask: Tell me about a couple of times in the past few months when things were the worst for you‚Äîdid you think about suicide? If yes, then ask:&nbsp;Did you take any specific steps toward an attempt? What methods did you think about? What kept you alive?&nbsp; Tell me about the last couple of days‚Äîhow much would you say suicide has been on your mind, if at all?&nbsp; If so, then ask:&nbsp;Are there specific methods you‚Äôve thought about? Have you thought about how you'd kill yourself?&nbsp; If yes, then ask: Have you thought about when or where you'd kill yourself?
If they mention a specific method of suicide, then ask: What other methods are you thinking about? Is there a specific scenario where you think you would attempt suicide?
Have you ever attempted suicide in the past, or started to? Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Lethal means counseling makes sense for anyone at risk.
Individuals who struggle with mental health and/or substance use issues, and who are experiencing a major crisis, stress, or trauma, are also at risk of suicide and should receive lethal means training. Individuals who currently have suicidal thoughts would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who struggle with mental health/substance abuse issues, especially when they are also experiencing painful life crises, would benefit from lethal means counseling. Ask clients at risk directly about suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Ask clients at-risk specifically about their suicide plans, such as how and when they would do it. Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. People sometimes deny these even when they exist. Also, suicidal thoughts can emerge rapidly and many attempts are unplanned. Lethal means counseling should take place before a suicidal crisis occurs. Firearms is the method used most frequently in suicidal deaths. Suicidal Death Rates by Method: 51% Firearms
26% Suffocation/Hanging
12% Poisoning/Overdose (Poisoning from intentional drug or medication overdoses)
3% Gas Inhalation (Inhaling gas, usually carbon monoxide from motor exhaust)
2% Jumping/Falling (Jump from high place like bridge)
2% Cutting (Sharp instruments like razor)
4% Other Methods (like drowning) The lethality of the method used in a suicide attempt is one of the biggest factors determining whether the person lives or dies. While the intent matters, means also matters. If the method a person wants to use for suicide if not available when they are actually ready to go through with an attempt, one of two things is likely to occur: They will delay the attempt as they try to get access to the method they want to use. The greater the delay, the greater the chance the suicidal crisis will pass. They will substitute another method. If the substituted method is less lethal, this increases the chance the person will not die. And most people who survive an attempt do not later go on to kill themselves. The two methods used in the majority of nonfatal suicidal attempts are overdosing with medications and cutting with sharp instruments. Many people think these two methods are far more deadly than they actually are. This misperception may save a lot of lives.
We recommend that you do not share specific information with your clients about the low lethality of sharp instruments and medications. Which suicide methods are amenable to a means reduction approach? It depends on the following criteria: Number of Suicide Deaths: The number/percent of suicide deaths caused by a specific method. Lethality: The proportion of attempts by a given method that end in death (case fatality rate). Irreversibility: The inability for someone attempting suicide to stop once it has begun or to be rescued. More people stop an attempt than carry through with it. Accessibility: The immediate availability of the method. Access is particularly important when attempts occur rapidly with little or no planning. Acceptability: Cultural and/or individual tolerance or preference for using a particular method to kill oneself. Cutting: Low Number of Deaths

High Acceptability Firearms are used in more suicide deaths in the US than all other methods combined. They are also highly lethal irreversible, and easily accessible in many homes with guns (one-third of homes have guns). Since gun owners can voluntarily undertake steps to reduce access, you will want to discuss safe firearm storage with all clients at-risk of suicide. Medication Overdoses are not as lethal as firearms (though some medications and poisons are very lethal). It is also usually possible for someone to stop an overdose mid-attempt or to be rescued. However, overdose is by far the most frequent method of attempt, and medications are easily accessible in most homes. Therefore, it is wise to routinely advise at-risk clients to dispose of unnecessary medications and keep accessible only quantities that do not pose a lethal threat. When your client's suicidal ideation focuses on any other method, you will want to discuss with them ways to reduce access to that method. More suicide deaths are from firearms than any other method in the US. Firearms, jumping, and suffocation are most lethal than other methods. Cutting and poisoning/overdose have low lethality, on average. The method used in a suicide attempt can determine whether the person lives or dies. Use a method reduction approach for any lethal method that is mentioned by clients at risk. How amenable each method is to a means reduction approach depends on the following criteria: Frequency
Lethality
Irreversibility
Accessibility
Acceptability Since firearms are used in most suicide deaths and they are also highly lethal, acceptable, and accessible (in homes with guns), be sure to ask all clients at risk if they have access to firearms and discuss ways to reduce access. A method is considered lethal if a high proportion of attempts by that method end in death.
Approximately 80%-90% of intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates.
Only 1%-2% of intentional, self-inflicted wounds from sharp instruments, like a razor, are fatal. Cutting is not a highly lethal method. However, it is the second most commonly used method in attempts. Only 1%-2% of intentional overdoses or poisonings are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates. This is on average, however, certain medications and poisons are far more lethal than others. In addition, medication overdoses are the most common method of suicidal attempts. People who attempt suicide typically struggle with ongoing mental health or substance abuse issues.
While some attempts are planned, many are not. Acute suicidal crises are often brief, and escalation from thought to action can occur rapidly.
The lethality of the method used in an attempt can determine whether that person lives or dies. If a highly lethal means is not available, the individual's chance of survival is greater. Over 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not take their life later on, so reducing access to lethal means can save many lives.
An effective way to protect clients at risk of suicide is to reduce their access to highly lethal means before they experience an acute suicidal crisis. Feasibility: Can the client or their family actually take the steps at home to reduce access to the method? Reducing access to&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;and&nbsp;medications used for poisoning/overdose&nbsp;could feasibly be accomplished at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so could potentially save thousands of lives in the U.S. if routinely implemented with people at risk for suicide.
Access can be feasibly be reduced for these two methods: Firearms: Firearms are used in roughly half of all suicide deaths, are highly lethal, and are very accessible if they are kept at home. Medications: Medication overdoses are by far the most common method in suicide attempts. Although the vast majority do not result in death, some medications and medication combinations are highly lethal - and, if kept unlocked at home, very accessible. We recommend routinely discussing firearm and medication storage with all clients at risk of suicide. If a client's suicidal ideation focuses on a method other than firearms or medication, we also recommend discussing ways to reduce access to that method as well. When discussing firearm storage with clients and their family members, the goal is to maximize the client‚Äôs safety by reducing immediate access to firearms as much as possible while they are at risk for suicide. There are two main options for reducing access to firearms.
Safest: Store firearms away from the home: Storing firearms away from home is the most effective way to ensure clients don't have easy access to a gun if they experience a spike in suicidal feelings. Off-site options are listed in the next section. Second-best: Secure storage inside the home: The second-best option is securely locking firearms in the home (or disassembling guns and locking a critical component). The person at risk should not have the keys, know where the keys are kept, or know the combination to the storage unit. Keep in mind that safes and locks can be broken into or picked, some more easily than others. But any measures that put time and distance between a suicidal person and a firearm may save their life. Storing firearms away from the home temporarily until the person improves is the best way to reduce access to them. Self-Storage Rental Units: Many facilities allow firearm storage. Typically, the smallest units are 5 ft. By 5 ft., but some offer storage drawers or bins, which are less expensive. Prices typically include a small one-time administrative fee as well as a monthly charge that depends on unit size. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored in a facility. Friends or Relatives: Storing firearms with a trusted person is an excellent and free option, provided the person is legally allowed to hold them. Some state laws require a background check prior to transfer to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing firearms. Shooting Ranges: Shooting ranges and sportsmen‚Äôs clubs sometimes offer locker rentals for a relatively low monthly fee. Typically, only the owner holds the key and no background check is required because the ownership of the guns is not transferred. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored. Law Enforcement: Some law enforcement agencies will temporarily store firearms for safety purposes; others will not. It is best to know the processes and policies in your region before you need to implement these with a client. You or your client should contact the agency first; walking in unannounced with firearms could be mistaken as a threat. Some agencies will pick up the firearms at the person‚Äôs home. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required. Most agencies offer disposal services, if that is desired. Gun Shops: Some gun shops offer storage services, and a few specialize in this service (e.g., provide pick-up services, offer discounts for longer-term and multiple gun storage). Prices vary, although some shops will provide regular customers with free storage when there is a safety concern. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required, depending on the type of storage the shop uses. Pawn Shops: Pawning guns for a small loan amount can be a relatively low-cost, secure storage option in most states. Interest charges must be paid monthly. To reclaim their firearms, gun owners must repay the loan and go through a background check to verify they are not prohibited from owning firearms. Clients and family members who decide to store their firearms away from their house usually want to know when it‚Äôs safe enough to bring their firearms back into the home. "Yes. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a case-by-case decision based on how the client is doing. Acute suicidal feelings can spike episodically. While these spikes are often brief, they can recur. It is prudent to wait until there has been a relatively long period of stability before returning the guns." Temporary storage of firearms away from the home cannot always be arranged immediately and isn‚Äôt always acceptable to the client or others in the home. Store in a gun safe or lock box: Lock guns, unloaded, in a gun safe or lock box. Many gun owners have multiple guns and ALL of them should be locked up, including rifles and self-defense guns. Remove a component: Remove a key component of the guns (such as the slides or firing pins) and lock them up - or better yet, store them away from the home. Use Gun Locks: Trigger locks, cable locks, and clamshell locks aren't as safe as locking in a secure gun safe, but they are better than not locking it at all - and when used in conjunction with a safe, can provide an additional layer of protection. Change the Combination or Key: If guns are already locked, change the combination or key location in case the person at risk knows how to access them. Remove Ammunition: Remove ammunition from ALL firearms. Keep all ammunition out of the home for now - or, at least, locked separately. Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
We recommend triple safety when storing them in the home: Locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked up separately (Ideally away from the home while the client is at risk)
What About a Self-Defense Gun? In some situations, clients or members of their household may want to keep their gun available for self-defense purposes. If this is the case, how you approach the situation and what you say will depend on whether the gun owner or the household member is the person at risk. Person At Risk: If the gun owner is the person at risk: Discuss the specific threats that are a concern to the client and the realistic risk of home invasion crimes.
Find out what other means of protection they would consider, such as self-defense sprays (if legal in your state), flood lights, an alarm system, or a dog.
Discuss what they are willing to do to keep themselves safe from suicide.&nbsp;
Would the client consider locking a self-defense gun and having another family member hold the key? If there‚Äôs resistance, consider creative solutions, such as putting pictures of loved ones or other reminders of reasons to live on their gun or lock box to interrupt or slow down a suicidal impulse. Work toward additional steps to reduce access over time. Household Member: If the gun owner is a member of the household: First, discuss the probabilities of suicide attempt versus risk of home invasion in the near term (i.e., the risk of a violent home invasion is very small for most people and is dwarfed by the far greater risk of suicide if a despairing person has a gun close at hand)
If the gun owner is concerned about protecting family members, it may be helpful to mention that part of protecting them is keeping everyone safe from suicide.
If self-defense is determined to be essential, one option is for the gun owner to keep the firearm either on them or in a quick-release handgun safe to which the person at risk has no access. Overdose accounts for roughly two-thirds of suicide attempts treated in the hospital, but only a very small proportion (2% or less) prove fatal. However, some medications are more dangerous than others, especially when taken in combination. With over 250,000 attempts annually, at least 5,000 people die each year from an intentional overdose. According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the medications most frequently involved in overdose suicides are opioids (e.g., prescription pain medications such as oxycodone, methadone, and morphine). 5&nbsp; In suicide deaths by drug overdose, over half tested positive for an opioid. 6&nbsp;Opioids, when used alone or in combination with other types of drugs or alcohol can cause death by depressing the respiratory system. Other drugs that are frequently implicated in overdose deaths include benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolytics and muscle relaxants), antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping pills (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially diphenhydramine‚ÄîBenadryl), and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). These substances usually do not appear alone but rather in combination with an opioid, with one another, and/or with alcohol. Alcohol use can increase the lethality of an overdose and may increase the risk that the person will carry through with an attempt.
Unfortunately, information about lethal combinations of medications is readily available on the Internet. Safely dispose of all unneeded and outdated medication in the home. Opioids should not be kept at home unless absolutely necessary to manage pain. If opioids must be kept at home, they should be locked and inaccessible to the person at risk. If the at-risk client must take the opioids to manage pain, discuss the possibility of having another household member or support person dispense the pills. In high-risk situations involving opioid use, also keep at least two doses of Narcan Nasal Spray, which is a highly effective rescue drug that lay people can administer. When used in time, Narcan can immediately reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Always lock up abuse-prone drugs such as prescription painkillers, anxiety medications, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Many inexpensive lock boxes can easily be broken into. A steel toolbox secured by a padlock is a safe, inexpensive option. For other necessary medications (both over-the-counter and prescription), only keep on hand limited quantities that would not constitute a serious danger if taken together. Lock up the rest. Advise families to ask their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what constitutes a safe quantity of medication to have in their home. The Poison Control Hotline at 800-222-1222 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) can also provide guidance on safe quantities. A family member or support person should seek this information, not the person at risk for suicide, since the information could be used to increase the lethality of an attempt. Use lower-toxicity rather than higher-toxicity medications, if possible, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant rather than a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant. Limit medication to quantities and combinations that, even if taken all at once, will not do serious harm. Consider requiring weekly refills to reduce lethality and increase contact.
Take into account the client's use of alcohol and other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. Some combinations are more deadly than others. If you have a client with a prescription for psychiatric medications, choose your words carefully so that you don‚Äôt send mixed messages or inadvertently inform the person about the lethality of the medications. If a client‚Äôs suicidal thoughts focus on methods other than guns or medications, incorporate those methods into your lethal means counseling. For example, if ideation focuses on filling the garage with car exhaust or crashing the car into a telephone pole, and the client has strong suicidal feelings, discuss ways to limit access to the car, such as having a family member hold onto the car keys temporarily.
What if ideation focuses on a certain method? There are times when a client‚Äôs ideation focuses on a very specific method that serves as their escape plan and may also have personally significant meaning. For example, your client carries around a belt that he could use to hang himself like his uncle did. If ideation focuses in this very specific way on one particular item, work with the client on agreeing to give up that item for now, while identifying strategies for staying alive. What about methods that cannot easily be restricted at home? Sometimes a client‚Äôs ideation focuses on suffocation or other highly lethal methods that are nearly impossible to control access to. These clients may need close supervision from family, friends, or others to ensure they don‚Äôt attempt suicide, particularly if their suicidality is of a more chronic or recurring nature. The client may opt to stay in a hospital if they feel the supervision would be helpful. Just One Part of a Safety Plan: In all cases, reducing access to lethal means should be part of a broader collaborative safety plan aimed at helping a client learn how to cope with suicidal feelings, as well as part of a broader therapeutic plan aimed at reducing the reasons for dying and increasing the reasons to live. To reduce access to firearms, the safest option is to store them away from the home. Possible storage options include with a relative or friend; with law enforcement; in a self-storage rental unit; or at a gun shop, shooting range, or pawn shop.
To reduce access to firearms that are stored in the home, use triple safety measures: Lock all firearms (or disassemble guns and lock a critical component), unload all firearms, and lock ammunition separately (or don‚Äôt keep ammunition at home for now).
Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
Guns that are kept at home for self-defense must be addressed since they are usually the ones that are most accessible. To reduce access to medications, remove unneeded medications from the home; keep only non-lethal quantities on hand; and lock up abuse-prone drugs, such as prescription painkillers, anxiety pills, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Discuss ways to reduce access to any method a client mentions using. Since escalation to a suicidal crisis can happen rapidly, the goal is to make the home safer for clients at risk before they are actively suicidal. Counseling on access to lethal means is for three types of clients:
Clients who have recently had suicidal thoughts.
Clients who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress. Clients who are struggling with a difficult mental health or substance abuse issue, particularly when they are also coping with a life crisis, such as relationship breakup, housing dislocation, arrest, or financial or job problems. These clients may not be currently suicidal but could become suicidal quickly. Routinely discus ways to reduce access to firearms and medications routinely with any client at risk of suicide. In addition, discuss any other method that a client with suicidal ideation considers using. Lethal means counseling is a client-centered intervention, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Your approach and the language you use are important to making this conversation effective, whether speaking to your client or to their friends and family members. Have a collaborative conversation and work together. With this approach, the client is the expert and the clinician is a resource. Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis as well as the need to reduce access to lethal means. Make specific and feasible plans. Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences. A guiding approach that is collaborative and client-centered is usually best, such as that used in motivational interviewing. Seek input from the client about their own reasons for - and against - reducing access, their own safety concerns, and what they would be willing to do. A collaborative approach accepts the client's values and works from the client's own motivations. "I can see how hard this has been for you lately, and I'm concerned about you. Are you concerned too?"
"What ideas do you have about ways to increase your safety in case you experience suicidal thoughts?" If your client is a gun owner: "Lots of people have guns at home. Some will store their guns outside of their home temporarily - such as at a relative's house or a gun shop - until they are feeling better. What do you think about a strategy like that?" A directive approach has a less collaborative tone and puts the clinician in the role of the expert. With certain clients, this approach may be more appropriate, for example: Clients who are too overwhelmed or stressed to make clear-headed decisions. Clients from certain cultures who may feel more comfortable getting advice rather than being asked for their ideas. Examples of Directive Statements: "I'm going to recommend that for now you store your guns away from home. Is that something you can do?"
"You'd be safer if you stored your guns away from home for now."
"I'm going to suggest you use this gun lock and have your wife keep the key."
"It would be best if you kept only a week's supply of medications at home and had a family member store the rest."
"For now, let's have your partner store your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in a lock box." No Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts: Some clients may disclose that they are suffering but say they are not suicidal. This may well be true for some clients; however, others may in fact be suicidal or likely to become so. If the client is having a very difficult time, and especially if life stressors are also present (e.g., custody battle, painful breakup, upcoming prison sentence, housing dislocation, work troubles), engage them in a conversation about reducing access to firearms and medications in case suicidal feelings develop.
Examples of how to respond to clients who say they are not suicidal: "I'm glad you're not feeling suicidal right now. Sometimes people who are struggling may have a crisis and suddenly experience strong suicidal feelings. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but if it does, I want to be sure you make it through safely and get the help you need. Can we talk over a plan, just in case?" When clients you suspect are suicidal don't disclose: "It's not unusual for people who have experienced the kind of pain you are going through recently to feel like it will last forever and to think they would rather be dead. Can we talk over a plan for how you'd stay safe if you started feeling suicidal?" Some clients, even if they are suicidal, may express resistance to reducing access to lethal means, like firearms. If clients or family members seem resistant, listen to what they say and work collaboratively toward solutions that address their concerns. For instance, some gun owners find the idea of living without a firearm in the home, even temporarily, very difficult. Don‚Äôt minimize that this may be a difficult decision. Examples on how to respond to clients who are in denial or resistant: When clients won't tell you whether they have a gun: Will you tell me what you‚Äôre worried would happen if you say you have a gun? I may be able to ease those worries. When clients think you are trying to take their gun away: "I am not questioning your right to own guns. Since you‚Äôve talked about feeling suicidal, I‚Äôm concerned about helping you stay safe. Have you also been concerned?‚Äù When clients are concerned about what will go in their record: ‚ÄúBefore we talk about your specific situation, I can let you know what sort of information I will write down and what I can omit.‚Äù When a client is concerned about chronic pain: ‚ÄúI hear that you are concerned you won‚Äôt have access to your medications during a flare-up. Let‚Äôs come up with a plan that supports both your health and safety.‚Äù When a family member is resistant to safely storing medications at home: ‚ÄúWhile it is true your child could get pills from a store, most suicide attempts occur at home with little or no preparation. Let‚Äôs talk about a plan that addresses your concerns and also ensures your daughter cannot take enough pills to harm herself.‚Äù Conversations about reducing access to lethal means are not always straightforward or easy. This can be especially true when discussing firearms. As a clinician, if you own guns you may feel more at ease raising the topic and more knowledgeable about storage options. If you aren‚Äôt a gun owner, it‚Äôs possible you might feel uneasy broaching the topic or overestimate client resistance. However, most gun owners value firearm safety and protecting their family‚Äîvalues that dovetail well with preventing suicide. When firearms are a family tradition and bonding experience: Consider alternatives
Discuss safety
Store guns elsewhere When guns provide safety and protection: Weigh concerns: Weigh the safety concerns of suicidality versus the concern of temporarily not having a firearm at home. Consider other options: Consider other things that could help keep the family safe such as pepper spray, alarms, or outdoor motion-detector lighting. Prioritize client's health: Underscore that part of protecting the client's family is ensuring the client is alive and well. Discuss behavioral history: Ask about any history of impulsive or unexpected behavior, and build on that to reinforce your concern. When guns provide security due to PTSD: Ask how client feels: Ask if the client trusts themselves with a loaded gun close at hand. Consider behavioral strategies: Use a behavioral intervention (e.g. behavioral modification, behavior shaping, rehearsal) or other interventions that focus on taking small steps to reduce access and gradually increasing these steps. Talking to Parents/Guardians: When working with a person under age 18 who is at risk for suicide, involve parents or guardians. Let them know that you are concerned about a possible suicide attempt and explain that reducing access to lethal means can reduce the likelihood of a suicide death.
When the youth has expressed suicidal ideation: ‚ÄúThe fact that your child has had suicidal thoughts means we need to take the risk of suicide seriously. We‚Äôve talked about getting him into treatment. I‚Äôd also like to talk about steps you can take at home to help keep him safe.‚Äù
"If a child or teenager attempts suicide, it‚Äôs usually at home and it‚Äôs often a quick decision. Putting time and distance between them and a method that could do serious harm is one of the single most effective steps to protect your child." When the youth is not currently suicidal but at risk: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve asked her about suicidal thoughts, and she hasn‚Äôt disclosed any. Suicide is still a concern when kids are struggling. These thoughts can develop rapidly, often without warning, and can prompt an unplanned suicide attempt. Therefore, we routinely suggest a few important steps you can take at home.‚Äù
"With everything going on in your home right now and the impact on your child, it is best to make the environment in your home safer in case a suicidal crisis occurs unexpectedly. It is safest to temporarily remove all firearms from the home and to reduce access to medications, particularly those for pain and other drugs of abuse, while your child is at risk." Since firearms are the leading cause of suicide deaths, be sure to talk with the youth and their parents/guardians about guns in the home. Gather information from youth: Talk to your young clients about whether there are guns in the home and find out if they have access to them.&nbsp;For example, some clinicians ask youth, ‚ÄúHow long would it take you to get access to guns in your home?‚Äù
Talk to the parents about gun access and storage:
Speak to the adult in the household who is the primary gun owner (unless there are contraindications such as spouse abuse).&nbsp; Find out the following: How are the guns stored in the home? Since gun owners often have more than one, gather information about all of them.
Does their child have access to any of the guns in the home? Many parents underestimate their children‚Äôs knowledge about where guns are stored and how to access them (e.g., key or combination).&nbsp;
Are there other homes where the youth stays that may have guns? Discuss all possibilities, such as joint custody situations, relatives, hunting buddies, or other friends.
Make sure the youth cannot hear your discussion (even if it is by phone), especially if there‚Äôs a chance the child is unaware of household firearms. Explain the focus on firearms, if necessary: If parents ask why you are focusing on firearms, explain that they are the most lethal method of suicide and that unlike nearly every other method, there‚Äôs no opportunity for the person to change their mind or be rescued mid-attempt. Since suicidal feelings are often short-lived and can come on unpredictably, putting time and distance between an at-risk youth and firearms is an effective way to protect them. Lethal means counseling is client-oriented. When discussing lethal means with clients or family members, make it a collaborative conversation. Your approach and the language you use matters. A collaborative, guiding approach is usually best. A more directive approach is less collaborative but may be more appropriate with certain clients. When working with a young person at risk for suicide, always involve parents or guardians. Together with your client, collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means. Depending on the client‚Äôs situation, this plan usually covers firearms and medications, as well as any other methods that are the focus of your client‚Äôs ideation.
The plan should include the following: Clear roles and tasks: Who will do what (this is especially important to do if others are involved) A timetable: When each part of the plan will be done Family members may not be aware that suicide attempts usually occur with little or no planning and that the method a person chooses often depends on its availability. It can be helpful to inform family members or significant others and to enlist their support in reducing access to lethal means, for example, if there are medications which the client must access daily or occasionally. Benefits: Involving family can be very effective. In fact, families counseled to remove or secure lethal means are far more likely to do so than those who are not counseled. Additionally, results of a pilot study indicate the majority of families reported that the counseling they received was respectful of their needs. Considerations: Some clients will not want you to enlist the help of their family members. In these situations, close friends or peer mentors may be more acceptable and less risky to involve than family members. Collaborate with your client on who would be best to engage.
- Permission:
- Ask your client for permission to talk with others before doing so (e.g., spouse, romantic partner, parents, friends, or peer mentors). For minors (under age 18), you may talk to the parents or legal guardian without the client‚Äôs permission. To help maintain your relationship with a minor, however, be sure to inform your client before speaking with a parent or guardian.
- Permission Denied:
- If a client does not give you permission to talk with anyone, yet you believe that removal of a lethal means is necessary for the safety of that individual, this could be considered permissible communication. Consult the current HIPAA guidelines for situations like this.
- Remember, in order to collaborate effectively with a client (or their parents), the clinician should:
- Use language that indicates acceptance of gun ownership without judgement.
- Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis and the need to reduce access to lethal means.
- Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences, recognizing that gun owners tend to prefer language that emphasizes options and autonomy. Consider the Client's Reaction: Before finalizing a plan to reduce access to firearms, or any suicide method, consider your client's reactions to it and the likelihood of follow-through with the plan. If you are working with the parents or guardians of youth, take their reactions into consideration. The client‚Äôs (or parents‚Äô) response may reveal whether the plan is likely to be carried out. Examples: Initial reluctance from client: Is your client initially reluctant to implement the plan and then relieved when they agree? This may indicate strong commitment to that particular method and a positive indication that, for now at least, they are electing to live. Readily agreeable client: If your client readily agrees to give up access to means and puts up no resistance, you may need to be a little suspicious. Sometimes lack of resistance means that the person is already considering a substitute method or holding something back. For example, the client may be thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, now that I don‚Äôt have guns, I‚Äôll just use pills.‚Äù If you have doubts, say something like, ‚ÄúThank you for your help on this. Now I‚Äôm wondering what other means you‚Äôve considered and if those means are available to you.‚Äù Mixed messages from family members: If you are working with family members and one member is agreeable but the gun-owning family member seems reluctant, this may indicate a lack of commitment by the gun owner to follow through with the plan. Monitor Progress: Document and Monitor: Once you've arrived at a mutually acceptable plan for reducing access to lethal means, document it in your notes. Access to lethal means: For all persons identified at risk for suicide, indicate that you have assessed for specific access to lethal means. Recommendations and Steps: List any recommendations and steps agreed upon with the client to reduce access to lethal means and make the environment safer. Contact with Others: Indicate if you contacted family members or a support person to confirm the removal or securing of lethal means. If the client or family has engaged law enforcement, a pharmacy, or others to hold or dispose of lethal means, this should be documented in the medical records. One way to ensure that lethal means counseling becomes a standard component of working with people at risk of suicide is, where possible, to build prompts into electronic templates and paper forms that serve as a reminder. For example, systems that use electronic medical records can embed specific lethal means documentation into templates for intake assessments, crisis appointments, therapy or medication appointments, and many other appointment types. Recommendations for Follow-Up: Never assume that the agreed-on plan will go as intended. Follow-up is essential. Suggestions for monitoring progress: Make follow-up calls Call to check on progress and assess how the client is doing. Or ask the client or family member to contact you when they've carried out the tasks in the plan. Continue to assess suicide risk: Assess and monitor your client's risk of suicide on an ongoing basis. Things can improve or deteriorate rapidly. Return to discussions of means reduction as needed. Adapt plan Make any necessary changes to the plan if the client's situation changes. For instance, if a client moves out of their current home and in with a friend, the plan would need to be updated for the new living situation, and the friend would need to be collaboratively engaged in the plan. Encourage close supervision Encourage family, relatives, and friends to provide closer supervision since clients may struggle with their moods or have episodes of suicidal thoughts interspersed with stretches of feeling okay. Key Points: Collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means and enlist the support of family and friends. Agree on roles and timetable.
Document the plan in your notes and monitor progress. Continue to monitor the client's suicide risk as treatment continues. Update the plan to reduce means, as needed.

History and Ethical Principles: Introduction: The foundation of the federal regulations that govern the protection of human subjects in research can be found, in large part, in the ethical principles detailed in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>Belmont Report
The ethical principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. <br><a data-href="Respect for Persons" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/respect-for-persons" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Respect for Persons</a>:Respect for Persons
This principle includes two requirements: Acknowledge and treat individuals as autonomous. Protect those with limited autonomy. <br><a data-href="Beneficence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/beneficence" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Beneficence</a>:Beneficence
Two general rules reflect this principle: Do no harm. Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. <br><a data-href="Justice" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/justice" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice</a>:Justice
This principle requires researchers to: Treat people fairly. Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>. . Informed Consent: People have the right to expect that researchers will treat them as autonomous individuals, respecting their decisions about whether to take part in research and about what personal information they will or will not share with others. This is accomplished through a thorough informed consent process that is presented in a language understandable to the research subject. The Consent Process: The federal regulations about informed consent list elements of information that the researcher must provide to subjects. The regulations divide the elements into two categories. One category includes basic elements to be provided to all subjects. The second set includes elements that must be provided, when appropriate. Consent should begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a subject in understanding the research, what is expected of them, and the potential risks of harm and benefits. Regulations require that this information be understandable to the subject and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. The emphasis on subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) comprehension and presenting information that a 'reasonable person' would want to have in order to make an informed decision to participate, and providing an opportunity to discuss. This 'key information' is not defined in the regulation, but examples of key information were provided in the preamble to the revised Common Rule: The fact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary. The purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective subject's participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research.

It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness in non-global-directed activity).
Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition. Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndrome level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis. Note: Criteria 1-4 constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&nbsp;is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through adolescence and into adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity (over-activity). Based on data from the NSCH, the median age for onset for children with current ADHD was 6 years. More severe cases of ADHD in children, as described by parents, were diagnosed earlier. The median age of diagnosis for severe ADHD was 4 years. The median age of diagnosis for moderate ADHD was 6 years.
The median age of diagnosis for mild ADHD was 7 years. Approximately one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. Medication can be used to effectively treat ADHD symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity, and is the single most effective treatment for reducing ADHD symptoms.
Figure 2 is based on data from the NSCH and shows medication use among children with ADHD in 2011. An estimated 69.3% of children with a current diagnosis of ADHD received medication for ADHD.
Medication use increased 4% overall from 2007 to 2011, particularly among male teens.

Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person‚Äôs ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts in mood and energy levels are more severe than the normal ups and downs that are experienced by everyone. Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older. An estimated 2.8% of U.S. adults had bipolar disorder in the past year.
Past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among adults was similar for males (2.9%) and females (2.8%). An estimated 4.4% of U.S. adults experience bipolar disorder at some time in their lives.

The signs and symptoms of SAD include those associated with depression as well as disorder-specific symptoms that differ for winter-pattern versus summer-pattern SAD.
Symptoms of depression can include: Persistent sad, anxious, or ‚Äúempty‚Äù mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks
Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
Feelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
Decreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
Changes in sleep or appetite or unplanned weight changes
Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment
Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts For winter-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Oversleeping (hypersomnia)
Overeating, particularly with a craving for carbohydrates, leading to weight gain
Social withdrawal (feeling like ‚Äúhibernating‚Äù) For summer-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
Poor appetite, leading to weight loss
Restlessness and agitation
Anxiety
Violent or aggressive behavior Winter-pattern SAD should not be confused with ‚Äúholiday blues‚Äù‚Äîfeelings of sadness or anxiety brought on by stresses at certain times of the year. The depression associated with SAD is related to changes in daylight hours, not the calendar, so stresses associated with the holidays or predictable seasonal changes in work or school schedules, family visits, and so forth are not the same as SAD. To be diagnosed with SAD, a person must meet the following criteria: They have the symptoms of depression or the more specific symptoms of winter- or summer-pattern SAD listed above.
Their depressive episodes occur during specific seasons (winter or summer) for at least 2 consecutive years. However, not all people with SAD experience symptoms every year.
Their depressive episodes during the specific season are more frequent than depressive episodes experienced at other times of the year. It is estimated that millions of Americans experience SAD, although many may not know they have this common disorder. In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.
SAD occurs much more often in women than in men. Winter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-pattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people living farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in the winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England are more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida.
SAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves repeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes (less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I disorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other mental disorders, such as <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Eating Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eating Disorders</a>, <a data-href="Anxiety Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety Disorders</a>, or <a data-href="Panic Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Panic Disorder</a>. <br>SAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common in people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, such as <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. Researchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most research to date has investigated potential causes of winter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier to study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern SAD, and more research is needed.
Studies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-pattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also suggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help maintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may prevent these molecules from functioning properly, contributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.
Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in people with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is believed to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin D consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the winter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, further reducing serotonin activity.
Other studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to altered levels of melatonin‚Äîa hormone important for maintaining the normal sleep‚àíwake cycle. People with winter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can increase sleepiness and lead to oversleeping.
In contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have reduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days worsening sleep quality and leading to depression symptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high temperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, these theories have not been systematically tested.
Both serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body‚Äôs daily rhythm tied to the seasonal night‚àíday cycle. In people with SAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal daily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to seasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and behavior changes.
Negative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer and its associated limitations and stresses are also common among people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, however, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the mood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment. Treatments are available to help people with SAD. They fall into four main categories that can be used alone or in combination: Light therapy
Psychotherapy
Antidepressant medication
Vitamin D Light therapy and vitamin D are treatments for winter-pattern SAD, whereas psychotherapy and antidepressants are used to treat depression in general, including winter- and summer-pattern SAD. There are no treatments specific to summer-pattern SAD. Since the 1980s, light therapy has been a mainstay for treating winter-pattern SAD. It aims to expose people with SAD to a bright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in darker months.
For this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright light box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30‚àí45 minutes, usually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light box, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor light, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making this a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain eye diseases or people taking certain medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative treatments or use light therapy under medical supervision. Psychotherapy can help people with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that contribute to depression.
<br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a type of psychotherapy aimed at helping people learn to challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive and anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with SAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in two weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing negative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts about the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with more positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called behavioral activation, which helps people identify and schedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to offset the loss of interest they typically experience in the winter or summer.
When researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light therapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving SAD symptoms‚Äîalthough some symptoms got better slightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a long-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters found that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer. Medications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can be effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with talk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress.&nbsp;
Antidepressants take time‚Äîusually 4‚àí8 weeks‚Äîto work. Problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may need to try several medications to find the one that works best.
Because SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with disturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly enhance a person‚Äôs mood.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release form designed to last longer in the body. For many people, bupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive episodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring. Because many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. However, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD have produced mixed results, with some studies indicating that it is as effective as light therapy and other studies finding no effect. Because the onset of SAD is so predictable, people with a history of the disorder might benefit from starting the treatments mentioned above before the fall (for winter-pattern SAD) or spring (for summer-pattern SAD) to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms. To date, few studies have investigated whether SAD can be prevented.

Perinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. In rare cases, the symptoms are severe enough that the health of the mother and baby may be at risk. Perinatal depression can be treated. This brochure describes the signs and symptoms of perinatal depression and how you or a loved one can get help. Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The word ‚Äúperinatal‚Äù refers to the time before and after the birth of a child. Perinatal depression includes depression that begins during pregnancy (called prenatal depression) and depression that begins after the baby is born (called postpartum depression). Mothers with perinatal depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that may make it difficult for them to carry out daily tasks, including caring for themselves or others. The ‚Äúbaby blues‚Äù is a term used to describe mild mood changes and feelings of worry, unhappiness, and exhaustion that many women sometimes experience in the first 2 weeks after having a baby. Babies require around-the-clock care, so it‚Äôs normal for mothers to feel tired or overwhelmed sometimes. If mood changes and feelings of anxiety or unhappiness are severe, or if they last longer than 2 weeks, a woman may have postpartum depression. Women with postpartum depression generally will not feel better unless they receive treatment. Perinatal depression is a real medical illness and can affect any mother‚Äîregardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Women are not to blame or at fault for having perinatal depression: it is not brought on by anything a mother has or has not done. Perinatal depression does not have a single cause. Research suggests that perinatal depression is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Life stress (for example, demands at work or experiences of past trauma), the physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby, and changes in hormones that occur during and after pregnancy can contribute to the development of perinatal depression. In addition, women are at greater risk for developing perinatal depression if they have a personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder or if they have experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mental illness that occurs after childbirth. PP is a medical emergency, and it is important to seek help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Women who have PP can have delusions (thoughts or beliefs that are not true), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling things that are not there), mania (a high, elated mood that often seems out of touch with reality), paranoia, and confusion. Women who have PP also may be at risk for harming themselves or their child and should receive help as soon as possible. Recovery is possible with professional help. Some women may experience a few symptoms of perinatal depression; others may experience several symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of perinatal depression include: Persistent sad, anxious, or ‚Äúempty‚Äù mood
Irritability
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
Fatigue or abnormal decrease in energy
Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
Difficulty sleeping (even when the baby is sleeping), awakening early in the morning, or oversleeping
Abnormal appetite, weight changes, or both
Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause or do not ease even with treatment
Trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with the new baby
Persistent doubts about the ability to care for the new baby
Thoughts about death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby Treatment for perinatal depression is important for the health of both the mother and the baby, as perinatal depression can have serious health effects on both. With proper treatment, most women feel better and their symptoms improve.
Treatment for perinatal depression often includes therapy, medications, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may be an option to explore. Several types of psychotherapy can help women with perinatal depression. Two examples of evidence-based approaches that have been used to treat perinatal depression include <a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> and interpersonal therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help people with depression and anxiety. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations. People learn to challenge and change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior as a way of improving their depressive and anxious feelings and emotions. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar concerns. IPT is an evidence-based therapy that has been used to treat depression, including perinatal depression. It is based on the idea that interpersonal and life events impact mood and vice versa. The goal of IPT is to help people to improve their communication skills within relationships, to develop social support networks, and to develop realistic expectations that allow them to deal with crises or other issues that may be contributing to their depression. Women with perinatal depression are most commonly treated with antidepressants, which are medications used to treat depression. They may help improve the way the brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should notify their health care provider before starting antidepressants so their&nbsp;health care provider can work to minimize the baby‚Äôs exposure to the medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take antidepressants during pregnancy is very low; however, women should work with their&nbsp;health care provider to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and to find the best solution for their situation. Women may need to try several different medications before finding the one that improves their symptoms and has manageable side effects.
Antidepressants take time‚Äîusually 6 to 8 weeks‚Äîto work, and symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give medication a chance before deciding whether or not it works.
Do not stop taking antidepressants without the help of a health care provider. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. When a woman and her health care provider have decided it is time to stop the medication, the health care provider will help her to decrease the dose slowly and safely.
After the birth of a child, many women experience a drop in certain hormones, which can lead to feelings of depression. FDA has approved one medication, called brexanolone, specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. Administered in a hospital, this drug works to relieve depression by restoring the levels of these hormones. It is important to understand that depression is a medical condition that impacts the mother, the child, and the family. Spouses, partners, family members, and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of perinatal depression in a new mother. Treatment is central to recovery. Family members can encourage the mother to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.

Depression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.
To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.
There are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances. Includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities. (Also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder)
Consists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years. Depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression. Depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. A severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see). Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributed to another medical condition) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others 9 e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)
Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)
Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The episode is not attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria 1-3 represents a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a>, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion 1, which may resemble a depressive episode. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity.
In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: Major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. Specify if: With anxious distress (pg. 210-211)
With mixed features (pg. 211)
With melancholic features (pg. 211-212)
With atypical features (pg. 212)
With mood-congruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
With catatonia (pg. 213) [Coding Note: Use additional code F06.1]
With peripartum onset (pg. 213)
With seasonal pattern (applies to pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes) (pg. 214) Major depressive disorder is defined by the presence of at least one major depressive episode occurring in the absence of a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day, nearly every day (Criterion 1). The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes: Changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity
Decreased energy
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. To count toward a diagnosis of a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared with the individual's pre-episode status. The symptoms must occur nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation, which must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs to occur once. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly increased effort. The presenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest. The failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near delusional guilt.
The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps' (Criterion 1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, 'not caring anymore,' or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion 1.2)
Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations. In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion 1.3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion 1.3). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too ealry and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume)

Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>) <br>This diagnosis cannot coexist with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a>, or <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a>, though it can coexist with others, including <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Conduct Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/conduct-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Conduct Disorder</a>, and <a data-href="Substance Use Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/substance-use-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Substance Use Disorder</a> s. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. Chronic, severe, persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations: Temper outbursts: These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others).
They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion 3) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria 5 and 6). Chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion 4) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Consistent gender difference in prevalence have not been reported in population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance. The diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (6-18 years).
Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. A relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of: <br><a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>

<br><a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A family history may be a risk factor. Those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The same behavior deficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. Socioeconomic factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as post-conflict zones or communities affected by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and transitory. While irritability has a strong genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role. Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common. <br>Differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> and <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> requires particularly careful assessment. <br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> s in children involved longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child. During a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baselines. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. The irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder required severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. <br>In only approximately 15% of individuals with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. There is a more prominent mood component among individuals with mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. It should also be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood patterns. Children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. Children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual's mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice-weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. These two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. <br>The strongest overlap is with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. <br>If children have symptoms that meet criteria for <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a> and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Depression Disorder due to Another Medical Condition]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/depression-disorder-due-to-another-medical-condition.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Depression Disorder due to Another Medical Condition.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mood Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. But like people with anorexia, they often fear gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/bulimia-nervosa.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Eating Disorders/Bulimia Nervosa.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Binge Eating Disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Binge eating disorder&nbsp;is characterized by recurrent binge eating episodes during which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating.

Anorexia nervosa&nbsp;is characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health; a relentless pursuit of thinness; a distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight; and extremely disturbed eating behavior. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely malnourished. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).
A past year prevalence estimate for anorexia nervosa was not generated in the NCS-R sample of respondents.

Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person‚Äôs eating behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia nervosa. Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), median age of onset was 21 years-old for binge eating disorder and 18 years-old for both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Based on diagnostic interview data from the NCS-R, the data below indicate the past year prevalence of each type of eating disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&nbsp;can develop after exposure to a potentially traumatic event that is beyond a typical stressor. Events that may lead to PTSD include, but are not limited to, violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, combat, and other forms of violence. Exposure to events like these is common. About one half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but most do not develop PTSD. People who experience PTSD may have persistent, frightening thoughts and memories of the event(s), experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or may be easily startled. In severe forms, PTSD can significantly impair a person's ability to function at work, at home, and socially. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Anxiety Disorders/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panic Disorder]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Anxiety Disorders/Panic Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Start with a bowl of apples (or any fruit). Pass the bowl around and have each person take one item. Mindfully observe the piece of fruit for a few minutes. When the bell rings everyone puts the fruit back into the bowl and then see if each person can "recognize" their original fruit.
Instructions: First take your piece of fruit and weigh it up in your hands. Get a sense of the texture of the skin, the temperature, the weight, how it feels in the palm of your hand, how it feels as you run your fingertips across its surface. What do you notice here? Spend a few moments doing this.
Next, we are going to use our sense of smell to breathe in the scent of the fruit. What do you notice here? Try to stay with just sensing the fruit, perhaps notice if your mind begins to make associations.
Your mind will likely wander or begin thinking about things as you move through this exercise, so just notice make a note of these thoughts, and come back to paying full attention using your five senses.
Next, take a good look at the fruit. Noticing its visual qualities - color, shape, any irregularities, the stalk, surface texture. Just take it in - looking for details. Keep an eye out for any tendency to make comparisons or judge the fruit! You'd be surprised how often our mind rushes to judgements.
You could try next bringing the fruit up to your ear and listening to the sound it makes when you squeeze it or tap it. What sound does a fruit make? (I'll bet you never wondered that before!)
Next, take a few moments to feel your fruit. Noticing how it feels. Is it smooth? Is it rough?
Bring the practice to a close when you are ready.
When you are finished, it's good to reflect on the exercise... what did you notice? Was anything surprising? Where did your mind go? What do you miss when you are on autopilot? How might the skill of mindfulness and observing be helpful to you in your daily life? Under what circumstances might you use this skill? ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/observing-a-piece-of-fruit.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Observing a Piece of Fruit.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Therapist Activities]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This activity is to help identify the similarities and differences we may have. We want to honor and acknowledge those differences but also brings to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. This process might prove difficult or awkward. This is about getting to know each other and breaking down stereotypes. You can choose if and how you participate. This acticity is simple. Each one of us will read a statement. If the statement is something you have experienced, you cross the line. We will then reset and read the next statement. This exercise has to be done in complete silence.
The purpose of this exercise is to help students become more aware of the many types of diversity that exist and to find students who share the same experiences. For this exercise, students form a line across the classroom. Students are asked to step forward and then back into the line based on questions asked by the instructor. Start with questions that are non-threatening to get students comfortable with the exercise. Students can choose to ‚Äúpass‚Äù if they want. Vary the questions to suit your group of students. Listening: Let‚Äôs have silence throughout the exercise ‚Äì no talking, snickering, giggling, etc. Silence will allow all of us to participate fully. Silence will also enable us to experience our personal thoughts and feelings more deeply. Respect: It is imperative that we respect the dignity of each person who is here. Everything that is shared should remain confidential. Nothing that is offered should leave this room. Each statement will require you to make the decision crossing the line or not crossing the line. There are no right or wrong answers. NO PRESSURE. No one here is under any pressure to respond in any particular way to any of the questions. If you have any doubts about sharing some part of yourself, you should feel perfectly comfortable with your decision not to step forward.
What kind of feelings did you have as you participated?
How did you feel when there were fewer of you on one side of the room?
How did the movement of others influence you?
What did you learn through this activity that can make our group more welcoming. Walk across the line if your favorite color is blue. Look into the eyes of those you brought with you. Look at those you left behind. Allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling. Walk back across the line.
Questions: You prefer the city. You have visited another country. You have never flown. You know very little about your cultural heritage. You are the oldest in your family. You have lost someone you loved. You are from Ohio. You enjoy sports. You are an only child. You got picked on in school. Your parents divorced. You consider yourself a religious person. You prefer Coke to Pepsi.
You prefer vanilla to chocolate.
You have been in love
You have had surgery. You have lived in another state. You know someone who has been sexually assaulted. You have felt alone, unwelcomed, afraid. You knew someone who has attempted to die by suicide. You have cried at least once this year for someone or something other than yourself. You or someone you know is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. You have been a bystander to a racial, sexual, or cultural joke. You have read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. You did not cross the line in a previous statement when you should have. You are willing to understand, support, and celebrate diversity. If you have not crossed the line during this activity, cross it now. Here are some additional questions: Walk across the line if you have ever experienced a bad hair day.
Walk across the line if you are undecided about your major. Walk across the line if your parents are divorced. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is in a gang. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about lives in poverty. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about has been homeless. Walk across the line if you have been told or think you are fat. Walk across the line if someone you care about has been abused physically, psychologically, or sexually. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is dependent on alcohol or drugs.
Walk across the line if you know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Walk across the line if you know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDS. Walk across the line if you have been put down by someone else and it hurt you. Walk across the line if you put someone down and you knew it hurt them. At the conclusion of this exercise, ask students what they learned from it. The usual comment is that students are not aware that so many share the same experiences.

Triggers: What emotional states have you experienced? What situations did you encounter that were difficult? How did you handle triggers? Address any significant changes in your life including in your living environment, employment, relationships, etc. Is there anything you would like to focus on today in group? Any questions or personal situations you would like to discuss with the group. It helps to talk about the things your group members are doing well first. Start with the positive before providing more challenging feedback. Empathy statements are helpful. Put yourself in the other person's shoes. Self-relating statements are also beneficial. Explain how you have had similar thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Some suggestions for how to start feedback include: "I really thought you did a good job talking about..."
"What was it like to share that with the group?"
"What do you think about..."
"I would have liked to have seen..." ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/group-therapy-facilitation/check-ins-&amp;-feedback.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Group Therapy Facilitation/Check-Ins &amp; Feedback.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Emotions Activities]]></title><description><![CDATA[
What is your current emotional state? Do Frank Weber's emotions assignment. Color in the amount of each feeling inside you in this moment. Explain why you have that level of the emotion
Emotional Alphabet Activity Identify as many emotions as possible for each letter of the alphabet. Role-Play In groups of two, they are to create a scenario based on an emotion and role-play it for the group. They cannot actually state the emotion, or describe it in detail, but rather show the situation that elicits that emotion. The other group has to guess the emotion being displayed and explain how they saw that emotion (verbals and non-verbals)
Have clients select feeling words or emotion cards and act out that card. Have clients select feeling words and roleplay when they felt this way. Collage Cut out pictures that relate to emotions. Find as many emotions as possible. Label the emotion. Feelings Charades Write different emotions on cards, clients draw a card to select an emotion. She then acts out the emotion without using any words. The other clients guess the emotion based on the client's facial expressions and other non-verbal clues/cues. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/emotion-regulation/emotions-activities.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Emotion Regulation/Emotions Activities.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Emotional Awareness Lesson Plan]]></title><description><![CDATA[

What are the client‚Äôs personal goals of skills to increase?&nbsp; Administer the Weekly Progress Check-In Sheet (see sheet below)&nbsp; Review last week‚Äôs skill of ‚ÄúMindfulness‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp; Did anyone practice it? Was it helpful? If so, how? If not, what got in the way?&nbsp; As we move into today‚Äôs group and the introduction of new skills, here is some ‚Äúfood for thought‚Äù from Linehan:&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ÄúThis book is dedicated to all the clients of the world who think that no one is thinking of them. I considered telling you that I would practice skills for you, so you don‚Äôt have to practice them. But then I realized that if I did, you would not learn how to be skillful yourself. So, instead, I wish you skillful means, and I wish that you find these skills useful.‚Äù&nbsp; Facilitate Mindfulness Guessing Item Activity: Start by educating on mindfulness (observing, describing, participating, being non-judgmental, one-mindful, and effective). Explore how these aspects of mindfulness will be integrated into the activity. Put items into a bag. Go around the room, everyone closes their eyes except the describer. The describer describes the item you gave them starting with broad descriptions and moving into more specifics. I usually write on the board types of descriptions in case the person gets stuck such as the shape, purpose, feel, color, weight, size, texture, smell, taste, etc. As the describer begins describing the object, the rest of the group begins guessing what it is, until some gets it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Wise Mind Activity:&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding what is emotion mind, rational mind, and wise mind.&nbsp; Invite clients to draw what it looks like for you to be in rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Wise Mind Activity: [SKIP]&nbsp; Chain of commitments to wise mind: cut slips of paper, write or draw descriptions of wise mind, hand the chains in your room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise:&nbsp; Ask group members to identify one thing in their life right now that they know they need to accept. They can take a moment to identify that thing, write it down, and maybe even describe why they belief they need to accept it. Then they rate their level of acceptance on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 being no acceptance and 10 being full acceptance ‚Äì if they have written it down, they are beyond a 0 which is positive).&nbsp;&nbsp; View Linehan introducing ‚ÄúPracticing Radical Acceptance‚Äù&nbsp; <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI" target="_self">https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI</a>&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding practicing acceptance.&nbsp; Introduce worksheets.&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise: [SKIP]&nbsp; Defining Myself Circle: Draw a large circle on a piece of paper.
