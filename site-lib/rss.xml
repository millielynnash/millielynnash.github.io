Literally, 'something for something,' an equal exchange or substitution.

Lederer &amp; Jackson proposed The Quid Pro Quo contract as an implicit contract that every relationship contains. It is a contract in which people exchange positive things with one another. They suggested this kind of reciprocity breaks down in relationships that are ailing, and trust becomes eroded. In 1977 Bernard Murstein found that quid-pro-quo way of thinking was characteristic of both ailing friendships and relationships. Once a partner becomes an emotional 'accountant' there is something wrong.

In other words, the moderator influences how, or under what conditions, the IV affects the DV. Helps determine under what conditions or for whom an effect holds true. Imagine you are studying the impact of a training program (IV) on job performance (DV). However, you hypothesize that this relationship differs based on work experience (moderator). For individuals with high work experience, the training might have a stronger (or weaker) effect on performance compared to those with low work experience. In this case, work experience moderates the effect of training on job performance. <br>When conducting moderation analysis (typically through <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a> with an interaction term). Several assumptions should be met: <br>The relationship between predictors (including the interaction term) and the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Variable" data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DV</a> should be linear.

Look for a straight-line relationship between each predictor and the DV. <br>Run your <a data-href="Regression Analysis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/regression/regression-analysis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Regression Analysis</a> Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear
In the Linear Regression dialog, click Plots. Move the standardized predicted values on the X box and standardized residuals to the Y box. Click Continue and then OK. Check the plot for a random scatter (no obvious patterns or curves) which supports the linearity assumption. The variance of residuals should be consistent across levels of the predictors. Use the same plot created for checking linearity. Look for a consistent spread of residuals across all predicted values (no funnel shape or systematic change in spread). You can also use tests like the Breusch-Pagan test in SPSS (via additional syntax or plugins) if a more formal assessment is needed. Residuals from the regression should be approximately normally distributed. After running your regression, save the standardized residuals. Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram and plot the residuals. The histogram should show a bell-shaped curve. In the regression dialog (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), Click Plots.
Add a Normal Q-Q plot by moving the standardized residuals to the Y box. A Q-Q plot where the points closely follow the diagonal line indicates that the residuals are normally distributed. <br>The observations should be independent of each other (i.e., no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>) Ensure that your data collection method supports the assumption of independence (e.g., participants are sampled independently) When running the regression (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), SPSS outputs the Durbin-Watson statistic.
A value around 2 suggests that the residuals are independent. Values deviating substantially from 2 indicate potential issues. Predictor variables (including the interaction term) should not be too highly correlated. <br>Ensure that variables are centered (or standardized) to reduce <a data-href="Multicollinearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multicollinearity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multicollinearity</a> when creating interaction terms. <br>Multiply the centered <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a> and <a data-href="Moderator" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/moderator.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Moderator</a>.

<br>Enter the IV, moderator, and the interaction term as <a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a> s. For moderation analysis, use Model 1. PROCESS automatically creates the interaction term (Training x Work Experience)
If your variables are continuous, it is often recommended to center them first (or use PROCESS options that center them automatically) IV and Moderator Coefficients: These represent the effect of the IV and moderator on the DV when the other variable is at its mean (if centered). Interaction Coefficient (IV × Moderator): Significance: A statistically significant interaction term (typically p &lt; .05) indicates that the effect of the IV on the DV changes depending on the level of the moderator.
Interpretation: If the coefficient is positive, as the moderator increases, the effect of the IV on the DV becomes stronger (or more positive); if negative, the effect weakens (or becomes more negative). Purpose: To determine how the IV-DV relationship varies at specific values of the moderator (e.g., at the mean, one standard deviation above, and one standard deviation below the mean).
Output: SPSS (via PROCESS) often provides these slopes along with their confidence intervals and p-values. Suppose you get the following (hypothetical) output:
IV (Training): b = 0.30, SE = 0.10, p = .003
Moderator (Work Experience): b = 0.20, SE = 0.08, p =.012
Interaction (Training × Work Experience): b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002 The significant interaction (p = .002) suggests that the effect of training on job performance depends on work experience.
A simple slopes analysis might reveal that for individuals with high work experience (e.g., +1 SD), the effect of training on performance is stronger (say, b=0.45b = 0.45b=0.45) compared to those with low work experience (e.g., -1 SD, b=0.15b = 0.15b=0.15). Below is an example of how you might report your findings in APA style:
A moderation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 1) to examine whether work experience moderated the relationship between training and job performance. The results indicated a significant interaction between training and work experience, b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002, suggesting that the effect of training on job performance varied as a function of work experience. Simple slopes analysis revealed that the relationship between training and job performance was stronger for participants with high work experience (b = 0.45, p &lt; .001) compared to those with low work experience (b = 0.15, p = .045). These findings indicate that work experience significantly moderates the relationship between training and job performance.

In other words, it is a variable that you control for to help isolate the effect of your main <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable(s)</a>. Covariates are used to adjust for variables that might confound the relationship between your main predictors and the outcome. For example, if you're studying the effect of a new teaching method on exam scores, you might include prior GPA as a covariate to account for baseline academic ability. By accounting for variability in the dependent variable that is due to covariates, you can reduce the error variance. This improves the precision of your estimates and increases the statistical power of your tests. Including covariates can help provide a clearer picture of the relationship between your primary variables of interest and the outcome, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. In analyses like ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance), covariates are used to adjust the means of the groups so that comparisons are made at a common level of the covariate. Imagine you're evaluating the effectiveness of a training program (the primary independent variable) on job performance (the dependent variable). However, work experience (the covariate) might also affect job performance. By including work experience as a covariate, you control for its effect, allowing you to more accurately determine the impact of the training program on job performance.

Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File
Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/Testing for Normality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:33:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structural Equation Modeling]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Structural equation modeling Thumbnail" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Example_Structural_equation_model.svg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">

Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. <br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ≈ .487
This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA. Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
Recall 'ballpark' effect size: Weak (|r| ≥ .2) Weak (r2 ≥ .04 or 4%) Moderate (|r| ≥ .4) Moderate (r2 ≥ .16 or 16%) Strong (|r| ≥ .8) Strong (r2 ≥ .64 or 64%) ACES (Adverse Childhood Experiences) -&gt; Psychological symptoms

𝛽1: Slope (How much DV increases as IV increases by 1 unit) One statistician movie fan decided to use statistics to study the movie ratings in his favorite movie guide, Movie and Video Guide (1996), by Leonard Maltin. Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film. The statistician used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 100 movies rated by the Guide.
Rating: Maltin rating (range is 1 to 4, in steps of 0.5) Length: Running time (in minutes) Year: Year the movie was released Cast: Number of case members listed in the guide Origin: Country (0 = USA, 1 = International) Finding b0 and b1 (regression coefficients) for the regression line: <br><img alt="9.

"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package." The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: β1 = 0
H1: β1 ≠ 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: ρ &gt; 0
H0: ρ2 = 0
H1: ρ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br><img alt="9.

For negative emotion change (hypothesized to decrease), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = -2.393, p = .011. The mean difference is -0.20 (negative emotion decreased after watching the video). The 95% upper confidence limit -. 0585 below zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly smaller than 0).
For positive emotion change (hypothesized to increase), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The mean difference is 1.06 (positive emotion increased after watching the video). The 95% lower confidence limit .7809 above zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly greater than 0). tobs = d ÷ sd-bar or d ÷ (sd ÷ √n) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - µ0) (s ÷ √n)
Where is µ0? Given 𝛼 level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).

Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score.

For negative emotion change: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n = .48742 ÷ √34 = .08359
tobs = d-bar ÷ sd = - .2000 ÷ .08359 = -2.393 For positive emotion change: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n = .95754 ÷ √34 = .16422

Since the p-value (. 011) is smaller than the 𝛼 level (. 05), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' negative emotion significantly decreased after watching the cat videos. Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to increase (one-tailed test). H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = 1.05882, SD sd = .95754, sd-bar = .16422
tobs = 6.448, df = 33, p &lt; .001
Since the p-value is very small (&lt; .001), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' positive emotion significantly increased after watching the cat videos. Cohen's d = d-bar ÷ sd-bar Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test: d = ( - µ0) ÷ s Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ±0.2: Small effect
d = ±0.5: Medium effect
d = ±0.8: Large effect Paired Samples Effect Sizes
For negative emotion change, Cohen's d (- 0.410) suggests a small to medium effect. For positive emotion change, the effect size (d = 1.106) is quite large. The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The results from the pre-test (M = 13.5, SD = 2.4) and post-test (M = 16.2, SD = 2.7) memory task indicate that the presence of caffeine in the bloodstream resulted in an improvement in memory recall, t(19) = 3.1, p = .006. There was a significant increase in the volume of alcohol consumed in the week after the end of semester (M = 8.7, SD = 3.1) compared to the week before the end of semester (M = 3.2, SD = 1.5), t(52) = 4.8, p &lt; .001

If your t-test is one-tailed, you need to say so. It's preferred to report the exact p-value unless it's smaller than .001. You need to state your alpha level (usually .05) early in the results section. If your p-value is smaller than .001, it's conventional simply to state p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)
Remember to drop the leading 0 from the p-value. No need to provide a formula for observed t in your paper. Observations are from a random sample, and the scores are independent of each other. Dependent variable of interest is measured on at least an interval scale. Difference scores (d's) are normally distributed. Typically considered robust to violations of non-normality, especially for big sample (n &gt; 30)
If one of the samples is highly skewed (particularly for a one-tailed test), a lot of error will tend to be built into the difference scores. Other non-parametric analyses would be better alternatives. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/paired-t-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/Paired T-Test.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:31:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

A bar graph can be used to visually depict the differences as well. Example Language: "We conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine whether there was a mean difference of depression scores between subjects who were diagnosed with depression and who were not. The ANOVA results showed that there was a statistically significant mean difference between the two groups (F (1,22) = 117.42, p &lt; .001)." The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis:<br>

Where µ = group mean and k = number of groups. If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which is that there are at least two group means that are statistically significantly different from each other. The one-way ANOVA is an Omnibus test statistic, and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test. It is used to test research questions and hypotheses where you want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single dependent variable. You are asking if there is a significant difference between the groups based on a single categorical independent variable with multiple levels. If you are dealing with individuals, you are likely to encounter this situation using two different types of study design: One study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then randomly split this group into three or more smaller groups (i.e., each participant is allocated to one, and only one, group). You then get each group to undertake different tests (or put them under different conditions) and measure the outcome/response on the same dependent variable. For example, a researcher wishes to know whether different pacing strategies affect the time to complete a marathon. The researcher randomly assigns a group of volunteers to either a group that (a) starts slow and then increases their speed, (b) starts fast and slows down or (c) runs at a steady pace throughout. The time to complete the marathon is the outcome (dependent) variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-5.png" target="_self"> A second study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then split them into groups based on some independent variable. Again, each individual will be assigned to one group only. This independent variable is sometimes called an attribute independent variable because you are splitting the group based on some attribute that they possess (e.g., their level of education; every individual has a level of education, even if it is 'none'). Each group is then measured on the same dependent variable having undergone the same task or condition (or none at all). For example, a researcher is interested in determining whether there are differences in leg strength between amateur, semi-professional and provessional rugby players. The force/strength measured on an isokinetic machine is the dependent variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-6.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-6.png" target="_self"> <br>Every time you conduct a t-test there is a chance that you will make a <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. This error is usually 5%. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of "making a mistake" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests. However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors. An ANOVA controls for these errors so that the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> remains at 5% and you can be more confident that any statistically significant result you find is not just running lots of tests. When you choose to analyze your data using a one-way ANOVA, part of the process involves checking to make sure that the data you want to analyze can actually be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a one-way ANOVA if your data "passes" six assumptions that are required for a one-way ANOVA to give you a valid result. <br>Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (<a data-href="Interval Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Interval Variable</a> and <a data-href="Ratio Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratio Variable</a>) (i.e., they are <a data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous Variable</a>; IQ score, exam scores, weight, etc).
The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group that is being compared in the one-way ANOVA (technically, it is the residuals that need to be normally distributed, but the results will be the same). <br>For example, if we were comparing three groups (e.g., amateur, semi-professional, and professional rugby players) on their leg strength, their leg strength values (<a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>) would have to be normally distributed for the amateur group of players, normally distributed for the semi-professionals and normally distributed for the professional player. You can test for normality in SPSS. <br><a data-href="Testing for Normality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Testing for Normality</a> There is homogeneity of variances. This means that the population variances in each group are equal. If you use SPSS Statistics, Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances is included in the output when you run a one-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics. <br><a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>. This is mostly a study design issue and, as such, you will need to determine whether you believe it is possible that your observations are not independent based on your study design. <br>Your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Typically, a one-way ANOVA is used when you have three or more categorical, independent groups, but it can be used for just two groups (but an <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> is more commonly used for two groups)
Example independent variables that meet this criterion include ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate, and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist) and so forth. <br>You should have <a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. For example, there must be different participants in each group with no participant being in more than one group. This is more of a study design issue than something you can test for. If your study fails this assumption, you will need to use another statistical test instead of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., a repeated measures design). There should be no significant outliers. Outliers are simply data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern (e.g., in a study of 100 students' IQ scores, where the mean score was 108 with only a small variation between students, one student had a score of 156, which is very unusual, and may even put her in the top 1% of IQ scores globally). The problem with outliers is that they can have a negative effect on the one-way ANOVA, reducing the validity of your results. <br>Your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. We talk about the one-way ANOVA only requiring approximately normal data because it is quite 'robust' to violations of normality, meaning that assumption can be a little violated and still provide valid results. You can test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which is easily tested for using SPSS Statistics. <br>There needs to be <a data-href="Homogeneity of Variances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/homogeneity-of-variances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homogeneity of Variances</a>. You can test this assumption in SPSS Statistics using Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If your data fails this assumption, you will need to not only carry out a Welch ANOVA instead of a one-way ANOVA, which you can do using SPSS Statistics, but also use a different post hoc test. <br>The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options: Transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed
Choose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality. There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated. Welch
Brown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you can run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most situations, it has been shown that the Welch test is the best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in SPSS. A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumptions to fail. Often, there is little you can do that offers a good solution to this problem. Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-Way ANOVA<br>

Specify contrasts, or planned comparisons, to be conducted after the overall ANOVA test. When the initial F-test indicates that significant differences exist between group means, contrasts are useful for determining which specific means are significantly different when you have specific hypotheses that you wish to test. Contrasts are decided before analyzing the data (i.e., priori). Contrasts break down the variance into component parts. They may involve using weights, non-orthogonal comparisons, standard contrasts, and polynomial contrasts (trend analysis).<br>

<br>When the initial F test indicates that significant differences exist between group means, post hoc tests are useful for determining which specific means are significantly different when you do not have specific hypotheses you wish to test. Post hoc tests compare each pair of means (like <a data-href="T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">T-Test</a> s), but unlike <a data-href="T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">T-Test</a> s, they correct the significance estimate to account for the multiple comparisons.<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-3.png" target="_self"> Multiple comparisons options that assume homogeneity of variance (each group has equal variance). By default, a 2-sided hypothesis test is selected. Alternatively, a directional, one-sided hypothesis can be specified if you choose to use a Dunnett post hoc test. Click the box next to Dunnett and then specify whether the Control Category is the Last or First group, numerically, of your grouping variable. In the Test area, click either &lt; Control or &gt; Control. The one-tailed options require that you specify whether you predict that the mean for the specified control group will be less than (&gt; Control) or greater than (&lt; Control) another group. Multiple comparisons options that do not assume equal variances. The desired cutoff for statistical significance. By default, significance is set to 0.05. Clicking Options will produce a window where you can specify which Statistics to include in the output (Descriptive, Fixed and Random Effects, Homogeneity of Variance Test, Brown-Forsythe, Welch), whether to include a Means Plot, and how the analysis will address Missing Values (i.e., Exclude cases analysis by analysis or Exclude cases listwise). Click Continue when you are finished making specifications.<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2.png" target="_self"> You will have calculated the following results or obtained them from SPSS. <br>"There was a statistically significant difference between groups as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 4.467, p = .021)." this is all you will need to write for the one-way ANOVA per se. However, you will probably also want to report means ± <a data-href="Standard Deviation (SD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviation-(sd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Standard Deviation (SD)</a> s for your groups, as well as follow up a statistically significant result with a post hoc test. The general form of writing the result of a one-way ANOVA is as follow:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-7.png" target="_self">
You should not report the result as 'Significant difference,' but instead report it as 'statistically significant difference.' this is because your devision as to whether the result is significant or not should not be based solely on your statistical test. Report the result of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., 'There were no statistically significant differences between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 1.397, p = .15)'). Running a post hoc test is usually not warranted and should not be carried out. You need to report your results. You then need to follow-up the one-way ANOVA by running a post hoc test. You need to perform the same procedures as above, but add into your results section that this assumption was violated and you needed to run a Welch F test. ANOVA test tells you whether you have an overall difference between your groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups differed - post hoc tests do. Because post hoc tests are run to confirm where the differences occurred between groups, they should only be run when you have a shown an overall statistically significant difference in group means (i.e., a statistically significant one-way ANOVA result). Post hoc tests attempt to control the experiment-wise error rate (usually alpha = 0.05) in the same manner that the one-way ANOVA is used instead of multiple t-tests. Post hoc tests are termed a posteriori tests; that is, performed after the event (the event in this case being a study). There are a great number of different post hoc tests that you can use. However, you should only run one post hoc test - do not run multiple post hoc tests. For a one-way ANOVA, you will probably find that just two tests need to be considered. If your data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances, use Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. Note that if you use SPSS Statistics, Tukey's HSD test is simply referred to as 'Tukey' in the post post hoc multiple comparisons dialogue box. If your data did not meet the homogeneity fo variances assumption, you should consider running the Games Howell post hoc test. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/one-way-independent-anova.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/One-Way Independent ANOVA.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:31:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/one-way-anova.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/one-way-anova.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Multivariate Model]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The simple model (i.e., mean-only model) is not very informative and has a lot of error.
- Y = 𝛽0 + 𝜀
Our model-building goal is to improve prediction and thereby reduce the error. To improve prediction and reduce error, we add a predictor variable (X) to the model. This enhanced model is the beginning of a 'predictive formula' that predicts individual outcome variable scores (Y) better than just predicting the mean. To use a bivariate regression model, identify two types of variables: <br><a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a>, or known variable (x)

The estimate of the population parameter, which we calculate using our sample data, is designated by the Arabic letter b. We can predict a person's score on an outcome (dependent) variable (Y-Hat) based on what we know about that person's score on a predictor (independent) variable (x). If variables x and y are related to each other, then adding x to our model improves prediction and produces less error (SSE) than the simple model generated. Here we have two competing models: You can use bivariate regression to answer the following questions about the pattern of data points and the significance of a linear equation: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?
Which equation of a straight line can best describe this pattern?
Are the predictions made from this equation significant? More questions using Bivariate Regression: What is the nature of the relation between x and y?
Is b statistically significant? What is the Confidence Interval for b. What is the effect size?
How is the y variance partitioned between explained and unexplained?
Do plots of residuals indicate violations of assumptions for bivariate linear regression? The error produced by Model C is the most error a parametric model can have. Thus, we often call this model as the simplest or null model.
<br>We call the sum of squared errors generated by Model C the <a data-href="Sum of Squares Total (SST)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares Total (SST)</a>.
We call the sum of squared errors by Model A SSEA. SST is almost always greater than SSEA. SST = SSEA + SSR Y-Hat = b0 + b1X Y-Hat: Predicted value of Y
b0: Intercept, the value of Y when X = 0. b1: Slope, the change in Y relative to the change in X. We actually never know the true population value of parameter β; we only estimate with our data. Yi = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1Xi + 𝜀i We will calculate b1 first. Determine b0 and using b1.

To estimate the error generated by this augmented model (SSEA) we need to Predict a score on Y for each subject. Find the difference between each subject's predicted and actual scores on Y. Square the differences. Add them up. Y = 10.268 - .776x + 𝜀 <br><img alt="3. Bivariate Regression-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/3.-bivariate-regression-3.png" target="_self"> It is difficult to judge is an error reduction of 64.383 is a lot or a little. To help us get a sense of how much error we reduced, we express this reduction in error as a percentage of the total error (SST).
The regression model explained .805 (80.5%, effect size) of the original SST in variable Y. <br><img alt="3.

Bivariate Regression-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/3.-bivariate-regression-5.png" target="_self"> For the simple mean-only model, 𝛽0, was a constant equal to the mean of Y. Since the mean of Y was 6, 𝛽0 = 6. The intercept, 𝛽0, is the predicted value of Y when X is zero. Thus, if X has no meaningful value of 0, the estimated intercept is not informative. Centering the predictor of X to its mean can generate a better estimate because then the estimated 𝛽0 is now the predictor value of Y when the predictor X is its mean. Think about the 1 st year college CPA as the outcome (Y) predicted by the SAT score (X).

Y = 10.268 - .776 X + 𝜀

VIF &gt; 10&nbsp;→ High collinearity (problematic, requires corrective action). A high VIF suggests that one independent variable is highly correlated with others, making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.
<br>You can calculate VIF in SPSS using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Linear Regression</a>:
Click&nbsp;Analyze&nbsp;→&nbsp;Regression&nbsp;→&nbsp;Linear.
Specify Variables: Move the dependent variable to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box.
Move the independent variables to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box. Enable Collinearity Diagnostics: Click&nbsp;Statistics.
Check&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tolerance/VIF.
Click&nbsp;Continue. Run the Analysis:&nbsp;Click&nbsp;OK. The&nbsp;Coefficients Table&nbsp;in SPSS will include two relevant columns: Tolerance: The proportion of variance in a predictor not explained by the other predictors (Tolerance = 1/VIF).
VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): The degree to which variance is inflated due to multicollinearity. If&nbsp;VIF &lt; 5, multicollinearity is not a major concern.
If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 5, review the correlation between predictors.
If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 10, severe multicollinearity exists, and corrective action (e.g., removing variables, combining correlated variables, or using Principal Component Analysis) may be needed. "A multiple regression was conducted to predict Y based on X1, X2, and X3. The VIF values were examined for multicollinearity, with all values below 5, indicating no severe multicollinearity concerns (X1 VIF = 1.18, X2 VIF = 3.12, X3 VIF = 11.11). However, X3 showed high collinearity (VIF &gt; 10), suggesting a need for further analysis or model revision."

A statistical procedure designed to assess whether differences in the means of two groups reflect differences in their respective populations or are simply due to chance. Non-directional (two-tailed): To test if mean where sample came from (µ) is significantly different from hypothesized mean (µ0). H0: µ = µ0 vs. H1: µ ≠ µ0 Alternatively in terms of mean difference: H0: µ - µ0 = 0 vs. H1: µ - µ0 ≠ 0 Directional (One-Tailed): H0: µ ≤ µ0 vs. H1: µ &gt; µ0
H0: µ ≥ µ0 vs. H1: µ &lt; µ0 Reject H0 if tobs = (x bar - µ0) ÷ (s ÷ √n) falls into the critical region (determined by tcrit given the df) Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-sample t-test Pick variable and enter the Test Value (µ0) SPSS reports p-values for both one-sided (directional) and two-sided (non-directional) tests. However, confidence interval (CI) of mean difference is only constructed for two-sided. <img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-3.png" target="_self"> Set up hypotheses based on the research question. Where does the sample/observed mean lie on the sampling distribution?
Given the confidence level 100 (1 - 𝜎)%, what is considered extreme evidence?
Compared to the critical value, is the sample mean extreme enough to be considered different from µ0? For one-sample t-test (population σ unknown), we use Cohen’s d to report effect size.
Cohen’s d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ s Recall Cohen’s d for one-sample z-test: d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ 𝜎 So, here sample SD (𝜎) is used to estimate 𝜎.
Notice, unlike z or t scores, effect sizes are not affected by sample size Size of Cohen's d (by convention): Small effect: d = ± 0.2 Medium effect: d = ± 0.5 Large effect: d = ± 0.8 SPSS reports both one-sided and two-sided p-values, but only two-sided CI is reported. To obtain one-sided upper or lower confidence limits, run a test doubling the 𝛼 (alpha) level This doe snot affect the p-values reported in the output. Say if you are conducting a directional test a 95% confidence level and want to see LCL or UCL, you can change the confidence interval percentage from 95% to 90% in Options. The lower end of reported 90% CI would be 95% LCL (Lower Control Limit), and the upper end of reported 90% CI would be 95% (Upper Control Limit). Any variation detected inside the control limits probably occurred by chance. On the other hand, variation outside of the control limits likely occurred due to special causes. The upper control limit (UCL) and the&nbsp;lower control limit&nbsp;(LCL) serve as boundaries for expected deviation in data.

The null hypothesis stated that WTP would not differ from the retail price. The alternative hypothesis stated that WTP would differ from the retail price.
Based on a random sample of 20 OSU students, there was a mean WTP of $181.9 and a standard deviation of $231.215. Then compared against the hypothesized mean of $899, the one-sample t-test was statistically significant, t(19) = -13.87, p &lt; .001, indicating WTP is significantly different from $899.
In addition, the effect size Cohen’s d was -3.101, generally interpreted as a large effect (Cohen, 1988), indicating that there is about 3 standard deviations difference between WTP and retail price, with the WTP lower than the retail price. <br><a data-href="7.

Directional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (µ1). H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 Directional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (µ1): H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0 tobs = d ÷ sd-bar or d ÷ (sd ÷ √n) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - µ0) (s ÷ √n)
Where is µ0? Given 𝛼 level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).
Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; 𝛼 (SPSS) 𝛼 level is usually .05 (95% confidence level) Nondirectional: 100 (1 - 𝛼)% CI: ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x (sd-bar ÷ √n) To test greater (significant increase in post-scores): 100 (1 - 𝛼)% LCL: - tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores): 100 (1 - 𝛼)% UCL: + tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS

Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. Cohen's d = d-bar ÷ sd-bar Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test: d = ( - µ0) ÷ s Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ±0.2: Small effect
d = ±0.5: Medium effect
d = ±0.8: Large effect The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. Used for questions about whether the population standard mean (µ) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (µ0).
Non-directional (two-sided) or directional (one-sided)
Population standard deviation (𝜎) is unknown: estimated by sample standard deviation (s).
Assumptions: Observations come from a random sample, and subjects are independent of each other. Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30). <br><a data-href="P-Value" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/p-value.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">P-Value</a>

Sampling is the process of selecting a given number of units of analysis from a population. Although in social research these units are often individuals, they do not need to be but could be households, firms, countries, or whatever. Sampling is often based on randomness to ensure representativeness, although non-random sampling might be used in some circumstances. <a data-href="Access" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Access</a>

A statistical method analyzing the linear relationship between an interval level dependent variable and two or more independent variables. Predicts a continuous dependent variable using multiple independent variables.
Example:&nbsp;Predicting exam scores based on study hours and attendance. Analyze → Regression → Linear.
Move your&nbsp;dependent variable&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box and predictors to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box.
Click&nbsp;Statistics&nbsp;and select&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Durbin–Watson.
Click&nbsp;OK. Interpretation:&nbsp;R² = 0.61 indicates that 61% of the variance in exam scores is explained by the predictors. Interpretation:&nbsp;A significant F (p &lt; .001) indicates the model fits significantly better than one with no predictors. Interpretation:&nbsp;Both predictors are significant. VIF values are acceptable (&lt;10). The Durbin–Watson statistic (not shown here) should be near 2. "A multiple linear regression was conducted to predict exam scores from study hours and attendance. The overall model was significant, F(3,56) = 15.41, p &lt; .001, R² = 0.61. Study hours (β = 0.45, t(56) = 6.83, p &lt; .001) and attendance (β = -0.28, t(56) = -3.78, p = .002) were both significant predictors."

How to Check Plot residuals vs. Predicted values
Look for a random scatter.
In SPSS: Request Linear Regression Plots. Y &gt; ZPred
X &gt; Z Resid
If the scatterplot shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met. <br><img alt="Testing Homoscedasticity Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-homoscedasticity-example.png" target="_self"> Example Check if the spread of residuals is consistent across predicted house prices. Solution Apply transformations or use weighted least squares. An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <br><img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" target="_self"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File
Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above. Utilize Cook's Distance under the 'Residuals Statistics' Table<br>
<img alt="Testing for Extreme Outliers.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-extreme-outliers.png" target="_self">
If the maximum Cook's distance is below 1.0, then the assumption is met.
Other tests may give a different cutoff point, but for our purposes we will use 1.0. <br>Observations are independent of each other (no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>)
How to Check Use the Durbin-Watson test. If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 - 2.5, the assumption is met. Examples <br><img alt="Testing the Independence of Error.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-the-independence-of-error.png" target="_self"> For this example, we'll say 1.482 is close enough to 1.5 and the assumption is met.

The statistical association between two variables measured at ordinal, interval or ratio level. Many different 'correlation co-efficients' are used as measures of association. We already know many ways to represent the association between two variables, both measured on at least an interval scale. Scatterplot
Covariance sxy = (∑i = 1n (x1 - x-bar)(yi - y-bar)) ÷ n - 1 (𝜎xy for population)
Pearson correlation coefficient rxy = (sxy) ÷ (sxsy) (𝜌xy for population) The correlation reflects the noisiness and direction of a linear relationship, but not the slope of that relationship, nor many aspects of non-linear relationships. <img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).webp" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).webp" target="_self">
To test whether the sample correlation between x and y is significantly different from zero (non-directional): H0: 𝜌 = 0 vs. H1: 𝜌 ≠ 0 Directional alternatives are also possible. Assumptions: Linearity: The Pearson correlation assumes that the relationship among x and y is a linear relationship. Independence: Units or cases are randomly sampled from the population. tobs = r√(n - 2) ÷ (1 - r2)
tcrit: Given the 𝛼 level, t distribution with degrees of freedom (df = n - 2)
Reject H0 if tobs &gt; tcrit (or for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit)
Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; 𝛼
APA Style Writing Template: A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the linear relationship between x and y. There was a (weak / moderate / strong negative / positive) correlation between x and y, r (df) = (p-value). Notice: No need to report t. Restricting the range of scores on one or both variables will reduce the strength of a correlation. If the size of the standard deviation for one variable is reduced, everything else being equal, then the size of correlations with other variables will also be reduced. In other words, we need sufficient variation for a relationship to be evidenced through the correlation coefficient value.
HS GPA and ACT example: The strength of correlation between GPA and ACT will be lessened if we only focus on the graduates with summa cum laude (weighted GPA 4.2 or above). Correlation means the variables are related in some way, but correlations alone should not be used to infer cause. A high correlation between x and y might be a result of: x causes y
y causes x
A third variable z is causing both x and y (or even more variables are involved). Causality is not easy to prove. Application of complex statistical methods is not evidence for causality!
Causation (x -&gt; y) can only be inferred (formalized by the 19 th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill) if: x proceeded y
x was related to y
We can find no other plausible alternative explanation for the effect on y other than x. 'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .2 (weak)
r = ± .4 (moderate)
r = ± .8 (strong)
It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .1 (weak)
r = ± .3 (moderate)
r = ± .5 (strong) Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. You will learn regression models with multiple predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), in more advanced stats classes. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. <br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ≈ .487
This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA. Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
Recall 'ballpark' effect size: Weak (|r| ≥ .2) Weak (r2 ≥ .04 or 4%) Moderate (|r| ≥ .4) Moderate (r2 ≥ .16 or 16%) Strong (|r| ≥ .8) Strong (r2 ≥ .64 or 64%) xi: IV data point for subject i
yi: DV data point for subject i
yi: Expected/predicted value for subject i (i.e., the regression line)

Working with the squared values, our goal is to find estimate b0 and b1 to minimize the error sum of squares: SSE = The optimal solution: b0 = y-hat - b1x-bar Regression line goes through both means of x and y!
The slope is determined by the correlation between x and y with a scale of y per change in x. Analyze -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear
Define DV and IV (one IV for SLR)
Usually you'd already review descriptive statistics and correlations before running a regression, but you can also ask SPSS to report Descriptive in the Statistics option. Many other options are for MLR only. The default SPSS output has 3 sections: Model Summary (How much variance in DV is explained by the model)
ANOVA Table (Model significance)
Regression Coefficients (Equation for the regression line) Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts: What we can explain by the model (regression)
What we still cannot explain (error) Regression sum of squares (SSR)
Error Sum of Squares (SSE)
Total Sum of Squares (SSTO)
SSTO = SSR + SSE
SSR, SSE, and SSTO are available in the ANOVA table R2 indicates the proportion of variance in DV explained (accounted for) by the model, which can be considered the overall model fit. R2 = (SSR) ÷ (SSTO) = 1 - (SSE ÷ SSTO) = (Multiple R)2 In SLR, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation between x and y Multiple R is the correlation between yi and y-hati (always positive) In SLR, Multiple R = | rxy | Omnibus: Comprising several items
"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package." The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: β1 = 0
H1: β1 ≠ 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: ρ &gt; 0
H0: ρ2 = 0
H1: ρ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br><a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>

Many statistical procedures depend on the assumption that modelling errors are independent of one other. In the xontext of time-series research designs where, for example, repeated observations are made of the same entity such as an individual or country, this assumption is often not met. Where this occurs the errors are said to be autocorrelated. <a data-href="Heteroscedasticity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/heteroscedasticity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Heteroscedasticity</a>

Biases can be neutral, positive, or negative. Operating outside our conscious awareness. Based on inaccurate information or stereotypes. Implicit biases can impact our decisions, perceptions, and behaviors. Actions and decisions resulting from our biases create real world barriers to equity and opportunity. It is so important to learn about implicit bias, particularly those biases that don't align with your intentions or explicit beliefs. Implicit bias does NOT refer to those beliefs we conceal or suppress in an effort to appear non-biased.

Teachers with strong, implicit pro-White biases were more likely to take a 'teach-to-the-test' approach. Discipline decisions are challenging and stressful for everyone involved. Differences in discipline show up strongly with regards to race and gender. Subjective or ambiguous situations can activate implicit associations. Students of color are more likely to receive disciplinary measures for 'disruptive behavior', 'disrespect', and 'excessive noise.'
Culturally-influenced perceptions of student behavior. Implicit bias can turn even our best intentions into unwanted outcomes. Research is growing around the role of implicit bias in limiting opportunities. The race, gender, and program affiliation of the professor did not have an overall impact on the response. They responded better to White men. It is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to uncover our implicit biases through introspection. There are two ways to measure implicit biases: Examining our behavior
Neurological measurement Medical brain scanning technology Tools like fMRIs and the IAT are often utilized together. These associations can spill over into concepts unrelated to the 'prime'

Use culturally appropriate interventions. <br><a data-href="Cultural Humility" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/cultural-humility.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cultural Humility</a>: the ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented (or open to other) in relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important for the client. Culturally humble therapists rarely assume competence. Requires the therapist to engage in self-reflection and self-critique. Ability to express respect and lack of superiority even when cultural differences threatened to weaken alliance. Approach clients with respectful openness, and work collaboratively with clients to understand the unique intersection of clients' various aspects of identities. It is a disposition rather than a competency per se. "Culturally humble therapists not only strive to be effective but also cultivate a growing awareness that they are inevitably limited in their knowledge and understanding of a client's cultural background, which motivates them to interpersonally attune themselves to the client in a quest to understand the individual client's cultural background and experience."
Developed a measure of cultural humility from client's perspective, found that it was associated with alliance, and progress, added explained variance to alliance above and beyond cultural competence measure. Relational Ethics Perspective: Take responsibility for the way our communication shape others' understandings. Build relationships based on curiosity, openness, respect, and understanding of the mean making process. Participate in meaning making in ways that allow for creating inclusive positions. Understand how our positioning contributes to the creation of social reality. Transparently share our positions of power and their impact on moral decisions that are made, ideally collaboratively. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/ethics/ethics-and-cultural-awareness.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Ethics/Ethics and Cultural Awareness.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:25:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Worldview]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Any oppressive system has at its core the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. This idea gets elaborated in many ways - more intelligent, harder working, stronger, more capable, more noble, more deserving, more advanced, chosen, normal, superior, and so on. The dominant group holds this idea about itself. And, of course, the opposite qualities are attributed to the other group - stupid, lazy, weak, incompetent, worthless, less deserving, backward, abnormal, inferior, and so on. The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society - the laws, the legal system and police practice, the education system and schools, hiring policies, public policies, housing development, media images, political power, etc. When a woman makes two thirds of what a man makes in the same job, it is institutionalized sexism. When one out of every four African-American young men is currently in jail, on parole, or on probation, it is institutionalized racism. When psychiatric institutions and associations 'diagnose' transgender people as having a mental disorder, it is institutionalized gender oppression and transphobia. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. For example, if a policy unintentionally reinforces and creates new inequalities between privileged and non-privileged groups. The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close--the racist jokes, the stereotypes, the beatings and harassment, the threats, etc. Similarly, interpersonal sexism is what men do to women - the sexual abuse and harassment, the violence directed at women, the belittling or ignoring of women's thinking, the sexist jokes, etc. Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal. These kinds of oppressive attitudes and behaviors are backed up by the institutional arrangements. This helps to clarify the confusion around what some claim to be "reverse racism." People of color can have prejudices against and anger towards white people, or individual white people. They can act out those feelings in destructive and hurtful ways towards whites. But in almost every case, this acting out will be severely punished. The force of the police and the courts, or at least a gang of whites getting even, will come crashing down on those people of color. The individual prejudice of black people, for example, is not backed up by the legal system and prevailing white institutions. The oppressed group, therefore, does not have the power to enforce its prejudices, unlike the dominant group.
For example, the racist beating of Rodney King was carried out by the institutional force of the police, and upheld by the court system. This would not have happened if King had been white and the officers black. A simple definition of racism, as a system, is: RACISM = PREJUDICE + POWER. Therefore, with this definition of the systemic nature of racism, people of color cannot be racist. The same formula holds true for all forms of oppression. The dominant group has its mistreatment of the target group embedded in and backed up by society's institutions and other forms of power. The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change. Likewise, people who benefit the most from these systems internalize privilege. Privileged people involuntarily accept stereotypes and false assumptions about oppressed groups made by dominant culture. Internalized privilege includes acceptance of a belief in the inherent inferiority of the oppressed group as well as the inherent superiority or normalcy of one’s own privileged group. Internalized privilege creates an unearned sense of entitlement in members of the privileged group, and can be expressed as a denial of the existence of oppression and as paternalism. It should be clear that none of these four aspects of oppression can exist separately. As the diagram below suggests, each is completely mixed up with the others. It is crucial at see any oppression as a system. It should also be clear that trying to challenge oppression in any of the four aspects will affect the other three.

Example: Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/structural-intersectionality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Structural Intersectionality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social Location]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/social-location.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Social Location.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social Context]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/political-intersectionality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Political Intersectionality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paralanguage]]></title><description><![CDATA[

A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. While the 13th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries. We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community. We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/labor-acknowledgement.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Labor Acknowledgement.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kinesics]]></title><description><![CDATA[

A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/identity-politics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Identity Politics.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:23:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Identity Centrality]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The handbook used by health care professionals in the US and much of the world as the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders DSM contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders. It also provides a common language for researchers to study the criteria for potential future revisions and to aid in the development of medications and other interventions. Used universally with Guidelines for disorders
Not a 'perfect mirror of nature'
Imperfect because there is more to understand through research. Right now, it is a culmination of mental disorders, a dictionary used to communicate with administrators, clients, and clinicians. Provide a shared language among professionals and clients. Most up to date information to provide help and assistance
Clinical judgement, DSM is a 'part' of diagnosis. It must be used with clinical judgement. (What does 'clinical judgement' mean?)
We should not be using the DSM too rigidly, but providing the help our clients need. Problem: People who should take it least seriously is scientists. Cannot make the psychiatric progress clients need. 1840: Category 'insanity' first attempt to quantify and name psychiatric diagnoses 1844: APA published a predecessor of the DSM: A classification of institutionalized mental patients Early 1900's First description of schizophrenia by Emil Kraeplin 1917: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the insane, including 22 diagnoses. 1952: First DSM, 130 pages long, 106 disorders 1994: DSM-IV, 886 pages long, 297 disorders 2000: DSM-IV-TR, 943 pages long, 365 disorders 2013: DSM-5, 991 pages long, 157 disorders 2022: DSM-5-TR, 1050 pages long Standardizes billing and coding
Standardizes diagnoses and treatment
Guides research
Guides treatment Oversimplifies human behavior
Increases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis
Provides labels, which can be stigmatizing Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation
Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy Categorical: A categorical approach to assessment relied on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity.
Presence or absence
Yes or no Dimensional: Frequency: None of the time to all of the time
Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly Intensity/Severity: Absent 0, mild 1, moderate 2, severe 3 Duration: How long does it last? First (Categorical): Yes / no Second (Frequency): How often? Third (Intensity/Severity): Rating (Mild, moderate, severe) Fourth (Duration): How long does it last? Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders.
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation.
Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process.
Integrates measures administered at initial interview and over time to track symptom status and response to treatment. Disorder-specific and correspond closely to the diagnostic criteria.
Some are self-completed by the individual, couple, or family. Interpreted by the clinician
Shared back with the individual, couple, or family Others require a clinician to complete. A generic assessment instrument for health and disability.
Used across all diseases, including mental, neurological, and addictive disorders.
Short, simple and easy to administer (5 to 20 minutes)
Applicable in both clinical and general population settings.
A tool to produce standardized disability levels and profiles.
Applicable across cultures, in all adult populations.
Directly linked at the level of concepts to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) The reason for the assessment, including the member's: Perception of the condition
Description of symptoms (including reason for referral)
History of mental health treatment (including review of member's records)
Important developmental incidents
Maltreatment, trauma or abuse issues
History of alcohol and drug usage and treatment
Health history and family health history, including physical, chemical and mental health history
Cultural influences and their impact on the member An assessment of the member's needs based on: Baseline measurements
Symptoms
Behavior
Skills
Abilities
Resources
Vulnerabilities
Safety Assessment methods and use of standardized assessment tools
Clinical summary, including recommendations and prioritization of needed mental health or other services
Involvement of the member and member's family in the assessment and his or her preferences or referrals to services.
Sufficient data to support findings on all axes of the current Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM), and any differential diagnosis. We don't truly have systemic diagnoses in the US context
The medical model warrants an INDIVIDUAL (identified patient/client)
Diagnoses are listed by INDIVIDUAL
Diagnostic criteria for relational problems are needed. M The relationship comes first
Making a diagnosis is a team effort
Open-ended and check-list questions
Use screeners/questions to hone in on the diagnosis
Pay attention to clinical significance
Risk/benefit analysis of diagnosis
Understand comorbidity
Be cautious about 'other' categories
Document your thinking
Remember the stakes are high

Discernment counseling is a short-term process (one to five sessions) with the goal of greater clarity and confidence in the decision about a direction for the marriage, based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and each partner's contribution to the problems. It is not intended for cases in which one partner has made a final decision to divorce and simply wants a venue to convince their spouse to accept the decision. The immediate decision is whether to carve out a 6-month period of all-out effort in couples therapy to restore the marriage to health, with divorce off the table during that time. At the end of 6 months, they can reopen the decision about divorce on the basis of what they have learned about the prospect of successfully rebuilding their marriage. Therapy aims for improvement in the relationship (e.g., increased intimacy, decreased toxic conflict), whereas discernment counseling aims for clarity and confidence about a next step. The goal of discernment counseling is not to solve marriage problems but to see whether they can be solved.
There is no relationship homework for couples in discernment counseling, no teaching of skills during sessions, and no enactments of deeper ways to connect.
If clients ask for ways to manage their problems during discernment counseling, we use a 'restraint from change' approach by reminding them that relationship change should not be expected during discernment counseling. Path 1: The marraige as it has been: the status quo, neither divorce nor working in therapy to improve the relationship. Path 2: Separation or divorce Path 3: A 6-month commitment to couples therapy (and sometimes other forms of help, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, or individual therapy) with divorce off the table and with the possibility of putting divorce back on the table at the end of the 6 months. The idea behind path 3 is to move beyond amibalence about working on change and see whether it is possible to put the marriage into a place that would be good for both partners.
Path 3, as we emphasize repeatedly, involves each partner developing a personal agenda for change on the basis of a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and their role in the problems. An advantage of framing the immediate outcomes as paths is that it moves clients past the dichotomous choice between staying together or breaking-up. The therapist too can support the idea that something has to change - the marriage cannot continue as it has been. So sometimes the discernment process begins with agreements instead of disagreement - something has to change; the old ways of being married is no longer viable. Implicitly we are saying that divorce is not a failure in this process; it is simply one of the options to be explored in a serious way, even thought only one spouse is actively considering it. Sometimes it has taken years to build up the courage to put divorce on the table in a chronically distressed marriage. Path 3 avoids the 'in or out' conundrum by offering a provisional commitment to work hard on the relationship for a period, with divorce not an option for this period but something that can be revisited later if things do not change enough. Most of the work occurs in separate conversations with each spouse, with carefully orchestrated sharing of take-home messages from the individual conversations. The flow of the sessions goes this way: Time with the couple together
Meeting with one spouse alone (the other goes to the waiting room)
The other spouse returns and the first spouse summarizes key learning from the individual conversation Meeting with the second spouse alone
The second spouse shares learning from that conversation A check out with both spouses during which time the therapist shares reflections on the process thus far. The majority of the time is with each partner alone. Times when both parties are together in the room are carfully orchestrated to minimize demoralizing exchanges and to maximize the focus on what each is learning about themselves in the process, rather than what each wants the other to change. The individual conversations have both similar and different areas of focus for the leaning-in and leaning-out partners. Similar themes are helping each better understand the dynamics of the relationship (their relational dance), their individual contributions to the problems, and how these relational and personal issues could be addressed in couples therapy (and sometimes with other helping resources). In terms of different themes, the therapist helps the leaning-out spouse figure out which path to take on the basis of an exploration of the sources of the person’s pain and discouragement about the prospect of change. The focus is on making a decision that has integrity for one’s self and others on the basis of a deeper understanding of self and the marriage and how the problems could be addressed in couples therapy if that is the chosen direction. The limit of five sessions, although not immutable, creates an expectation of intense work within a limited time frame. Going on much longer also makes it difficult for the couple not to expect relationship change and for the therapist to not lapse into doing couple interventions.
We say one to five sessions and not five sessions because clients are asked each time about whether they want to do an additional session up to five. Some people are emotionally flat when their spouse is in the room and then liven up when our one-to-one time begins. A big part of this approach is helping clients see the difference between traditional marital therapy and discernment counseling and allowing them to indicate their willingness to engage in the process. We are interested in knowing exactly what the couple knows about discernment counseling. The clients must leave the conversation with an understanding that the goal for discernment counseling is to help them gain greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage. We pay specific attention to whether they are currently living together and the status of any legal proceedings associated with divorce. After collecting some basic information over the phone, we typically ask something such as, "Can you tell me a bit about your current situation and how do you think it might be helpful to your situation?" It is important that leaning-out partners feel heard and that they understand how this process is different from anything they have tried as a couple before. It is important to assess whether leaning-out partners have made a decision to divorce or are open to the work of discernment. The following questions can be helpful in determining this: "Would you say that you've made your decision about the future of your marriage or are you still seeking some level of clarity in this process?"
If they report that they have made a decision, you can ask about their level of confidence in the decision: "How confident are you that you're making the right decision?" For leaning-out partners who indicate they know they want a divorce and would like to use the session to 'break the news' to their partner, or for those who say they do not know how to tell their partner, you can inform them that this is not consistent with the goals of discernment counseling. You might respond in the following manner: "It may be that discernment counseling is not exactly a good fit for what you want to do. The goals of discernment counseling are to help people get a greater sense of clarity and confidence in their decision making about a direction for the future of their marriage based on a better understanding of what happened to the marriage to get it to the brink of divorce and each person's role in that. If you're hoping for a different outcome, like helping your spouse understand why you want a divorce, discernment counseling is not appropriate for your situation." Usually, the leaning-in partner makes it clear that they want to preserve the marriage, but if not, ask that question directly. If the leaning-in partner feels desperate to do anything to save their marriage, suggest that they purchase and begin reading Michele Weiner-Davis's (2002) book The Divorce Remedy. (They learn that they must first look at themselves and their own behavior before the marriage can get to a healthier place) "Her book is written specifically for people who have recently found out that their spouse is considering divorce. She gives some practical advice on how you can act toward your partner at this stage of the process. There are probably things you can be working on that will make the situation somewhat better without making your partner feel as though he or she is committing to working on the relationship. This approach may be your best option at the moment." We cannot emphasize enough the value of respecting client autonomy during this process. Never assume that both parties are equally interested in attending discernment counseling. Discernment counseling is a way of meeting both parties where they are and not privileging one person's agenda over the other. "It is really important that your spouse feel as though they have a choice in whether to come to discernment counseling. If he or she feels forced into it, it won't go well and will likely contribute to more estrangement from you on their part. " Never assume that because one spouse has told you about something that has been happening in the relationship, the other spouse knows about it. The intake conversation must be conducted one on one, without the person's partner or anyone else in the room. The person on the intake phone call has to be able to speak freely about their perspective on the problems they are having and the struggles they are experiencing making a decision regarding the future of their marriage. "Are you in a place that you can speak freely without interruptions?" If there is noise or other distractions, you may want to suggest a different time or place for the call. You also should ascertain whether the client has told their spouse about discernment counseling. "Have you discussed discernment counseling with your spouse? What do you think is his or her level of interest in participating? Does your spouse know that you and I are speaking today?" Avoid the temptation to speak to one partner right after the other for the sake of convenience. It is probably worth taking the time at the phone intake to ensure that no one is feeling forced into having this conversation. There is also benefit to suggesting that the first partner you speak with explain to their partner that they have spoken with a discernment counselor and that if the spouse is interested, they can e-mail or phone the counselor to set up an interview. In no case should you cold call the other partner, who may not be aware of the initial contact from the spouse. Consider using the following script as a guide to the initiator of the phone call: "It sounds like discernment counseling is appropriate for your situation according to what you've told me. The next step is for your partner and me to chat about their take on the situation and whether they are interested in discernment counseling. What might be a good idea for you is to tell your partner that we talked today, and point her to the website that describes discernment counseling. Further, you can tell them that if they are interested in doing this work, they can contact me directly and we can have a similar conversation to the one you and I just had. What is important here is that no one feels coerced to be part of this process. By putting the ball squarely in their court, they can demonstrate their willingness to do discernment counseling by initiating the call. " Respect the autonomy of each person to engage in this process at their own pace. The phone intake is to describe, in sufficient detail, the purpose, goals, and process of discernment counseling. "The goal of discernment is to help couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage based on a deeper understanding of the problems in the marriage and each person's contributions to them. "
"Discernment counseling is typically a brief counseling modality and could last anywhere between one and five sessions. There is no need to commit to all five sessions because each of you would only commit to attending one session at a time. "
"The format of the sessions consists of meeting as a couple with the counselor as well as having some time dedicated to one-on-one work with the counselor. After each one-on-one portion of the session, each partner will summarize what he or she is 'taking with them' from the time with the counselor and share it with the partner who was waiting outside the room. The first session is 2 hours, and subsequent sessions are an hour and a half each. "
"In discernment counseling, we discuss the paths that are before every couple on the brink of divorce. Path 1 we call the status quo path and represents your relationship continuing the way it current is. Path 2 represents the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the possible reconciliation path, in which the couple agrees to take divorce off the table for a 6-month period of couples therapy, and each one commits to work on the relationship to see whether they can get the relationship to a healthier place. These three paths frame the discussions we have in discernment counseling."
"Discernment counseling is different from typical marriage counseling. The goal is not to solve your problems but to help you decide whether to try to solve your problems or choose a different path. It's not about immediate change in your relationship but seeing what changes each of you might need to make in the future if you decide to work on yourselves and your marriage."
Finally, you can end this portion of the phone intake by asking how this process sounds to them and whether they are still interested on the basis of what you have discussed: "Does this sound like a process that might hold some value for you in your current situation?" We are mostly concerned with is whether one of the partners is feeling coerced to participate and whether participating in discernment counseling will put one of the partners at risk of IPV.
- "We want to make sure everyone who participates in discernment counseling does so voluntarily and that no one is put at risk. So I have a few questions that we ask everyone who contacts us for an appointment.
- Are you feeling pressured by your spouse to participate in this project? Yes / No.
- If yes, does the pressure seem coercive (for example, is it accompanied by threats with personal or legal ramifications)? Yes / No
- Have you or your spouse ever had an order of protection from a court? Yes / No
- If yes, who?
- My last questions are about what happens when you and your partner get into arguments or fights. Again, our goal is to make sure everyone is safe.
- Has your partner ever done something to you out of anger that has caused you physical pain, bruises, or bodily injury? Yes / No (If yes, get specifics)
- Do you ever feel afraid of your spouse? Yes / No
- If yes, are you in danger now? Yes / No
- If yes to either, I can help you talk to someone at an agency that can help you. Would you like me to give you that information? In an emergency, urge the person to call 911. Ask if you can call back to check on the person.
“Leaning In or Out Measure.png” could not be found. We strongly recommend a 2-hour block of time because of the amount of ground to be covered in the session. After both partners' perspectives are heard in response to a series of questions, the discernment counselor meets one-on-one with both members of the couple, and each briefly shares what he or she learned in the individual conversations. The session ends with the couple in the room together for a summary of the work that was done that day and any impressions the discernment counselor has to share. If both spouses agree, the second discernment counseling session is then scheduled. In this first meeting together, each person is asked to share their own and listen to the other’s views on how the relationship got to the point where divorce is a possibility, how they have tried to fix the problems they have identified, and how their children (if any) play a role in their decision making. They are also asked to provide a brief account of a time when things were going well in the relationship.

- Precontemplation:
- A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior; the person may be unaware that a problem exists
- Contemplation:
- The person becomes aware that there is a problem, but has made no commitment to change.
- Preparation:
- The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change)
- Action:
- The person is in active modification of behavior.
- Maintenance:
- Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional.
- Relapse:
- The person falls back into old patterns of behavior.
- Upward Spiral:
- Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/the-cycle-of-change.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/The Cycle of Change.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telehealth]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/telehealth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Telehealth.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stereotype]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stereotype.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Stereotype.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stages of Therapist Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-href="@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@pattersonessentialskillsfamily2018.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018</a>
Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, “self of the therapist” stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family. Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist’s ability to listen and attend to the client’s story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about “doing something” with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins. The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics. “I know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I’m stuck in the content.” Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
Therapists’ unresolved issues or “growth areas” can become impediments in therapy.
The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy. Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. Therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors. Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy. To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
You also need a strong social support network Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable Keep the “big picture” in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
Keep the following ‘reminders’ at hand:** Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stages-of-therapist-development.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Stages of Therapist Development.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Socioeconomic Status (SES)]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/socioeconomic-status-(ses).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Socioeconomic Status (SES).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Self-Concealment]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Responsible handing of secrets is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems. Secrets indirectly influence the couple system due to the consequences and symptoms of secrets. Literature on the disclosure of secrets in therapy is scarce. It is unethical for therapists to collude in keeping secrets. Through voluntary facilitated disclosure or referral therapists should avoid a double-bind while doing therapy with non-disclosed secrets. <a data-href="@butlerFacilitatedDisclosureClinical2009" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/ethics-(7770)/readings/3.-confidentiality-in-family-therapy/@butlerfacilitateddisclosureclinical2009.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@butlerFacilitatedDisclosureClinical2009</a>

The extent to which an intervention is implemented as intended. (pg. 1720)
Provides insight into why programs work or do not work. (pg. 1720)
There is a major caveat in previous effectiveness research with the absence of information on program integrity. It is often unknown to what extent programs are actually implemented as originally intended (i.e., program integrity). (pg. 1720) The absence of significant intervention effects can be explained either as a lack of effectiveness of the intervention itself, or as a failure to implement the intervention as originally intended. (pg. 1720) Based on the limited information on program integrity provided, there are differences with program implementation and integrity across studies. (pg. 1721)
Without documentation of program integrity it is impossible to determine whether significant, non-significant or ambiguous findings can be attributed to the theoretical model underly- ing the program, or to the implementation of the program.

A balanced therapeutic alliance is crucial for the success of couple therapy; the therapist does not accept the role of judge. If there is egregious or abusive behavior, the therapist takes a stand; violence is out of bounds and the principle of safety first is bedrock in any therapy. Nevertheless, even setting limits and identifying problematic behavior is done from a place of concern and compassion. The therapist maintains a stance of “multidirected partiality” partial to each partner, on each one’s side. When clients feel understood and affirmed, the therapist can challenge them. Multidirected partiality is not neutrality; the therapist cares about both partners, is partial to each. But the partiality is balanced. The couple therapy office must be a “shame-free, blame-free zone,” a safe environment for clients to explore their vulnerabilities and relational disappointments. It is crucial that clinicians be aware of their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies, and note when they get caught up in a vulnerability cycle with clients. Therapists need to address unfinished business with their own family of origin.

A mental disorder syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.
Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (i.e., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.

EQUIP is implemented in all juvenile correctional facilities as part of a nationwide methodology. (pg. 1720)
EQUIP is designed to teach antisocial youth to think and act responsibly by combining a peer helping and skills-streaming approach.

Suggest the differences between men and women stem from innate biological or psychological attributes. Previous studies have suggested men are less able to tolerate sustained levels of physiological arousal than women. This also suggest men and women grow up in differing social worlds. (Holley et al., (2010))
(Smith et al., (2010)) Stable differences between men and women explain why wife-demand/husband-withdraw (WDHW) occurs more than husband-demand/wife-withdraw (HDWW) (Eldridge &amp; Christensen, 2002). Some scholars have proposed that women are socialized to be more oriented towards relationships than are men (Napier, 1978)

Partners in a couple, seeing the same moment in different ways, may engage in “dueling realities.”
Making room for multiple narratives and differences of perspective and opinion, and recognizing the right of each to their own experience, are key aspects of relational ethics. Mentalization is the awareness that others have their own ways of thinking and experiencing. The therapist offers “construal humility” as a model, noting that we all construe or make sense of our world, but there are multiple ways to look at most interactions. Making room for dual narratives rather than dueling narratives is a key skill of relational ethics in both couple and intergenerational relationships. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/construal-humility.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Construal Humility.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:14:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Closed System]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This principle requires researchers to: Treat people fairly. Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research.

The accident was precipitated by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK-1000 reactor and operator errors. In particular, the RBMK reactor had an unstable design (a positive void coefficient), meaning a loss of coolant could accelerate the nuclear reaction, and its control rods had graphite tips that initially increased reactivity when inserted (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output could increase if cooling,other safety mechanisms have been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output%20could%20increase%20if%20cooling,other%20safety%20mechanisms%20have%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). During the test, operators disabled critical safety systems and drove the reactor to a low-power, unstable state. A sudden power surge ensued when they attempted an emergency shutdown, leading to massive energy buildup.<br>Moments later, a steam explosion blew apart the reactor core, followed by a second explosion (likely hydrogen or another steam blast) that demolished the reactor building and exposed the core to the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The blasts ignited fires, including a graphite fire in the reactor core, that burned for ten days. The underlying causes trace to poor safety culture and secrecy in the USSR at the time. An investigation later concluded that the accident was “the result of a flawed reactor design… operated with inadequately trained personnel,” exacerbated by Cold War isolation and lack of safety culture (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The April 1986 disaster at,lack of any safety culture" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20April%201986%20disaster%20at,lack%20of%20any%20safety%20culture" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In short, inherent reactor vulnerabilities and human mistakes combined to trigger the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.<br>The immediate human toll of Chernobyl was severe. Two plant workers were killed on the night of the explosion – one instantly, and another shortly after from injuries (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the days that followed, dozens of firefighters and first responders who heroically fought the fires received extremely high radiation doses. <a data-href="Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)</a> devastated many of them: 28 emergency workers died from ARS within a few weeks (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In total, roughly 30 people died in the initial aftermath (plant staff and firefighters) as a direct result of the explosions and acute radiation exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Dozens more suffered serious radiation injuries.<br>Soviet authorities evacuated the surrounding population as the scale of the disaster became evident. The nearby company town of Pripyat (population ~49,000) was not informed of the danger on the first day. Only 36 hours after the accident, on April 27, buses finally moved all Pripyat residents out, turning it into a ghost city (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion zone was established 36,8" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion%20zone%20was%20established%2036,8" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Over the next two weeks, the evacuation zone was expanded to a 30 km radius, ultimately relocating about 116,000 people by mid-May 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The sudden displacement and fear caused significant trauma among the population.Offsite, there were no immediate deaths, but radiation sickness symptoms did appear in some of the local populace soon after (e.g. headaches, metallic taste). Tens of millions across Europe were exposed to low levels of fallout (see environmental impact below), and children in affected areas were given iodine tablets in some regions to block radioactive iodine uptake. The psychological shock and confusion were immense – for Soviet citizens who were kept largely in the dark initially, and for neighboring countries alarmed by the drifting radiation.<br>The Chernobyl accident caused an unprecedented release of radioactive material into the environment. The initial explosion and subsequent fire ejected at least 5% of the reactor’s radioactive core into the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). A towering plume of radioactive gases and particles drifted with the winds for over a week. The most intense fallout blanketed areas close to the plant. A 4-6 km² pine forest immediately downwind was saturated with radiation; the trees literally died and turned rust-red within days, earning it the name the “Red Forest.” This 600-hectare patch of woodland absorbed lethal doses (up to ~100 Gray), killing the pines and many small animals in the area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>).

In the worst-hit zones, animals also succumbed – for example, horses on an island 6 km away died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by extreme radioiodine exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Livestock had to be slaughtered and crops were ruined across large swathes of land. Water and soil near the site were severely contaminated; radiological “hot spots” (with dangerous levels of cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, etc.) dotted the map in northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.<br>The radioactive plume did not stop at the Soviet borders. Within two days, winds carried radionuclides into Eastern and Northern Europe. On April 28, sensors at the Forsmark nuclear plant in Sweden (over 1,000 km away) detected radiation, forcing an investigation that revealed the source was Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant%2C,rising radiation levels%2C but a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the%20Forsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%2C,rising%20radiation%20levels%2C%20but%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). As the cloud spread, rain-outs deposited contamination in patches across Europe. Notably, parts of Belarus (to the north) received heavy fallout, as did areas of Scandinavia, Poland, Austria, and the UK. In the United Kingdom, for example, radioactive cesium from Chernobyl fell on upland pastures; in the immediate aftermath, the government restricted the movement of some 4.2 million sheep across 9,700 farms to prevent tainted meat entering the food supply (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).

Across Europe, a wide range of foods (milk, leafy vegetables, wild game, mushrooms, etc.) had to be tested or discarded in 1986 due to fallout contamination.<br>In the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, the environment was badly scarred. The reactor fire belched radioactive iodine-131, cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium and other isotopes into the air (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). Iodine-131 (with an 8-day half-life) delivered high doses to the thyroids of grazing animals and children who drank local milk in the first weeks, causing later thyroid disorders. Heavier elements fell close to the plant, creating an extremely hazardous zone within ~10 km. The Pripyat River and Dnieper water basin were threatened by runoff; emergency crews dug up topsoil and built dams to prevent contaminants from spreading through waterways. Despite these efforts, ecological damage was acute: plants died, and some animal populations in high-dose areas crashed or stopped reproducing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The immediate environmental legacy of Chernobyl was a poisoned landscape – an estimated 77 kilograms of radioactive material were lofted into the atmosphere, traveling as far as 2,000 km away (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>), and leaving a footprint of contamination that would last for generations.<br>The Chernobyl disaster had significant immediate political repercussions, both domestically within the Soviet Union and internationally. In the USSR, the accident exposed the deep flaws in the Soviet government’s crisis management and secrecy. Initially, authorities were slow to admit the severity of the situation. Local evacuations were delayed and the broader public was not informed promptly. Only on April 28 – two days after the explosion, once Swedish monitors raised global alarm – did the Soviet government make a brief 20-second announcement on state TV acknowledging an accident at Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An investigative commission has been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An%20investigative%20commission%20has%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). This minimalist statement offered few details, reflecting the regime’s instinct to cover up bad news. Such lack of transparency put citizens at risk and angered neighboring countries. Gorbachev himself did not publicly address Chernobyl until May 14, 1986, more than three weeks later. The delay and initial secrecy eroded public trust. Soviet citizens in Ukraine and Belarus, seeing helicopters overhead and troops moving without clear explanation, felt a sense of betrayal that they were not immediately warned of the invisible danger.<br>Internationally, Chernobyl proved to be a public relations disaster for the Soviet Union. The USSR was criticized for its failure to promptly alert the world and for rejecting outside help initially. The incident strained relations with Western Europe – for example, Sweden, Finland, and others demanded explanations as radioactive clouds crossed their territories. The political fallout added pressure on Soviet leadership to be more open and cooperative. The disaster became a catalyst for Glasnost (openness): it demonstrated the deadly cost of government secrecy. Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that “the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl… even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union” five years later (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls The nuclear meltdown at,The commission was to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls%20The%20nuclear%20meltdown%20at,The%20commission%20was%20to" target="_self">VIEW: Turning point at Chernobyl — Mikhail S Gorbachev</a>). While historians debate the extent of Chernobyl’s role in the USSR’s dissolution, it undeniably undermined the credibility of Soviet authorities. The tragedy spurred newfound environmental activism and public questioning of nuclear safety in the Eastern Bloc. In summary, the immediate political consequence was a profound shock that forced the Soviet government to confront its own shortcomings, setting in motion changes that transcended the issue of nuclear power.<br>In the decades since 1986, extensive studies have been conducted on Chernobyl’s health impact. The most clear-cut long-term health effect has been a sharp increase in thyroid cancer cases among those who were children or adolescents in affected areas at the time of the accident. Radioactive iodine-131 released from the reactor accumulated in pastures and was ingested via milk; this led to an epidemic of thyroid disorders. By 2005, over 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported in exposed children/teens (notably in Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Fortunately, thyroid cancer is largely treatable – the vast majority of patients survived. As of 2011, 15 deaths had been attributed to these Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Aggressive screening and treatment campaigns in the 1990s saved many lives. Aside from thyroid issues, major epidemiological surveys have not conclusively linked the Chernobyl accident to a generalized increase in other cancers or health effects in the broader population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), “apart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In particular, studies have not found a definitive rise in leukemia, solid tumors, or birth defects that can be attributed to Chernobyl radiation exposure in the general population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>However, it is important to note that estimating long-term deaths is complex and subject to debate. Low-dose radiation effects are hard to tease out from normal cancer rates. Some scientific models project that over the lifetime of those exposed, Chernobyl’s fallout could cause a few thousand excess cancer deaths (for example, one projection suggested about 4,000 future cancer deaths among the higher-exposed groups in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are expected from other causes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are%20expected%20from%20other%20causes" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Other analyses, often using the linear no-threshold model, predict higher numbers – for instance, a 2006 report (TORCH) estimated 30,000 to 60,000 worldwide cancer deaths in the long run due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Anti-nuclear organizations have cited figures in the tens of thousands as well (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). These larger estimates are controversial and not universally accepted; they rely on statistical assumptions and include very low-dose regions where any effect would be too small to measure. The consensus of bodies like the WHO and UNSCEAR is that outside of thyroid cancers, Chernobyl’s long-term health impacts (while tragic on an individual level) have been limited in scope relative to initial fears (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Nonetheless, each of those statistics reflects personal tragedies and serious illnesses that have affected thousands of families.<br>Beyond physical health, the psychological and social effects have been profound. The disaster uprooted entire communities and created an enduring sense of fear. Studies have found elevated rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse among Chernobyl evacuees and residents of contaminated areas ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015%29" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). The term “radiophobia” has been used to describe the chronic fear of radiation exposure that many people carry, sometimes causing more harm (in stress and mental health) than the radiation itself. Being labeled a “Chernobyl victim” or “survivor” led to social stigma and hopelessness in some cases (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Populations in affected areas often reported worse self-assessed health than objective medical exams would indicate, due to perceived danger (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Thus, a major long-term impact of Chernobyl has been on mental health and community cohesion. The disaster also had inter-generational aspects: while studies (including a 2021 whole-genome study) have not found evidence of significant genetic mutations passed to children of survivors or liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1929 Chernobyl liquidators,generational genetic effects.[ 223" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1929%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,generational%20genetic%20effects.%5B%20223" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>), young people from the region have grown up under the shadow of Chernobyl’s legacy, which influences their social and economic opportunities.<br>In summary, nearly 39 years on, Chernobyl’s health legacy is a mixed picture. There have been thousands of thyroid cancers (largely survivable), and possibly some increase in other cancers and health issues among the most exposed, but no mass epidemic of radiation-induced disease outside those categories that can be unambiguously demonstrated (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The trauma and displacement caused by the disaster, however, left lasting scars on public health in the form of psychological distress and disrupted lives.Paradoxically, the long-term ecological effects of Chernobyl include both persistent environmental contamination and the revival of wildlife in the abandoned zone. In the immediate aftermath, Chernobyl created one of the most radioactive environments on the planet, devastating local ecosystems. Yet over time, as humans withdrew from the area, nature has shown a remarkable capacity to rebound in many respects.<br>On the negative side, the environment remains contaminated with long-lived radionuclides that will persist for decades or more. Isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life ~30 years) and strontium-90 (half-life ~29 years) still taint the soil and vegetation in the Exclusion Zone and beyond. In the worst hot spots (e.g. the Red Forest and near the reactor), soil and plant life are loaded with radionuclide levels that inhibit normal biological processes. Studies have found increased mutation rates in many organisms: one analysis showed plant and animal mutation rates in the Chernobyl region were up to 20 times higher than normal background levels (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). There is evidence of elevated mortality and reduced reproductive success in some species living in the most contaminated areas, consistent with radiation-induced genetic damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). For example, some birds in high-radiation zones have been observed to have smaller brain sizes or cataracts, and fewer insects (like bees, butterflies, spiders) are found in these areas in some studies. Trees in certain plots grow more slowly due to radionuclide uptake. Forest ecosystems have been altered: the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) in soil were initially impaired by radiation, leading to a thick layer of semi-decomposed leaf litter that persisted for years. Even today, wild boar in parts of Germany and Austria still show high cesium levels from eating Chernobyl-tainted mushrooms and soils (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported,lamb industry in Norway were" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Agricultural%20Authority%20reported,lamb%20industry%20in%20Norway%20were" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). And periodic wildfires in the Exclusion Zone can remobilize radionuclides, as burning plants release cesium and strontium back into the air – a concern that persists each fire season. Thus, ecologically, Chernobyl created a chronic environmental hazard in the contaminated regions: a “dirty” ecosystem where radioactive elements circulate and will slowly decay over generations.<br>On the other hand, the absence of human activity in the vast Exclusion Zone has allowed wildlife to flourish in unexpected ways. With 2,600 km² of land (in Ukraine) largely free from people, the area has become an unintended wildlife sanctuary. By the 2010s, biologists conducting long-term censuses observed that many large animal populations were thriving. A 2015 scientific study using animal track counts and camera traps found no evidence of reduced mammal abundance in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone compared to similar uncontaminated nature reserves – in fact, populations of elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves were as high or higher than in less disturbed reserves (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The study concluded that chronic radiation had not significantly affected these wildlife populations; instead, the removal of humans (and associated activities like farming, hunting, logging) allowed nature to rebound vigorously (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Subsequent research and observations have noted an increase in biodiversity: the Exclusion Zone now hosts species rarely seen in the region for decades prior. Wolves roam in large numbers (some estimates suggest the zone has one of the highest densities of wolves in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Lynx and Eurasian brown bears – species that were once extirpated locally – have been spotted within the zone. Endangered European bison have been reintroduced and are breeding. The Przewalski’s horse, a rare wild equine, was released into the zone in the 1990s and now herds of these horses graze the grasslands of Chernobyl. Moose, foxes, badgers, wild boar, deer, and dozens of bird species inhabit the forests and marshes. Even the Pripyat town itself and derelict buildings are used by wildlife (e.g. nesting birds, small mammals). In essence, in the long term, Chernobyl’s ecosystem has transformed into a unique experiment: a landscape of high radiation pockets but flourishing wildlife, illustrating the resilience of nature when freed from human pressures (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some scientists have termed it a “accidental wildlife reserve.” Photographic evidence and surveys by organizations like the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve (established by Ukraine in 2016) document robust ecosystems, though still affected by the residue of contamination.<br>It’s important to balance this picture: radiation is certainly not “good” for wildlife, and in highly contaminated spots the damage to organisms is real (for instance, smaller creatures with short lifespans show higher mutation impacts). Scientists continue to debate the extent of sublethal effects on Chernobyl’s wildlife – some studies find more genetic abnormalities or shorter lifespans in animals from radioactive hot spots, while others point to the abundant population numbers as a sign of adaptation or tolerance (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). The likely reality is that many species have been able to recover because the benefit of habitat free from humans outweighs the detriments of the radiation levels they experience (which for most of the zone are low to moderate now). The Chernobyl zone has thus become a living laboratory for studying chronic low-dose radiation on ecosystems, with ongoing research that will inform ecology and radiobiology for decades. From an ecological perspective, Chernobyl’s legacy is a landscape of contrasts: lingering contamination and altered biological processes, alongside a teeming revival of wildlife in what has become one of Europe’s largest rewilded areas.<br>The Chernobyl disaster’s ramifications extended into the geopolitical and policy realm, influencing nuclear energy policies and international cooperation. In the Soviet Union, as mentioned, Chernobyl was a catalyst for Glasnost and political reform. It forced Soviet leadership to cooperate more with international authorities – for example, in August 1986 (just months after the accident), the USSR sent a delegation to the IAEA in Vienna to openly present details of the accident to the world, a notable break from past secrecy ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were subsequently restarted but all,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were%20subsequently%20restarted%20but%20all,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Gorbachev’s policies of openness were reinforced by the recognition that hiding disasters was untenable. In the bigger picture, Chernobyl “led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The Chernobyl disaster was a,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20Chernobyl%20disaster%20was%20a,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some commentators even argue that the disaster contributed to the fall of the USSR by exposing its systemic problems and costing enormous resources – as noted earlier, Gorbachev later said Chernobyl was a more important factor in the Soviet collapse than his own reform efforts (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C particularly between East and,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C%20particularly%20between%20East%20and,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>On the international stage, nuclear safety was fundamentally re-examined. Chernobyl was the first nuclear accident to directly result in radiation fatalities (and remains one of only two Level 7 accidents, along with Fukushima 2011). This spurred a wave of new protocols and cooperation. Western and Soviet-bloc experts began collaborating to prevent another Chernobyl. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was established, linking operators from over 30 countries to share safety information and peer reviews (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since 1989%2C over 1000 nuclear,in the Nuclear Power Industry" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since%201989%2C%20over%201000%20nuclear,in%20the%20Nuclear%20Power%20Industry" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The IAEA implemented the Convention on Nuclear Safety (adopted in 1994), a treaty that committed nations to international nuclear plant inspections and higher safety standards (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Design changes were rapidly instituted for RBMK reactors – all remaining RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania, etc.) were retrofitted with safety upgrades: e.g. adding neutron absorbers, faster shut-down systems, and eliminating the positive void coefficient at low power (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications have been made to,see Post accident changes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications%20have%20been%20made%20to,see%20Post%20accident%20changes" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) so that a Chernobyl-type runaway reaction “is now virtually impossible” in those reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). International aid (through organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped finance these safety improvements and the eventual decommissioning of Chernobyl’s other reactors.<br>Public opinion toward nuclear energy also shifted significantly after Chernobyl, especially in Europe. The accident fueled anti-nuclear movements and policy reversals in several countries. For example, in Italy, Chernobyl triggered a national referendum in November 1987 in which over 80% of voters chose to abandon nuclear power; as a result, Italy shut down its existing reactors and scrapped plans for new ones (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C only the widespread popular,a question of individual conscience" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C%20only%20the%20widespread%20popular,a%20question%20of%20individual%20conscience" target="_self">Nuclear Power, No Thanks! The Aftermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the Nuclear Power Referendum of 1987 | Environment &amp; Society Portal</a>). In West Germany, large anti-nuclear protests took place, and although Germany did not immediately phase out nuclear (that came later), Chernobyl planted seeds of skepticism that eventually contributed to Germany’s decision to end nuclear power by 2022. Other countries like Austria (which had completed a nuclear plant but never fueled it, due to a referendum) felt vindicated. Even far from Europe, Chernobyl had an impact: nations such as the United States and UK reviewed their emergency preparedness; some countries paused or scaled back nuclear projects. The accident underscored that a nuclear disaster is not confined by borders, leading to improved international radiation monitoring networks and emergency response coordination (for instance, the EU created rapid notification systems for nuclear incidents).<br>Geopolitically, Chernobyl also imposed huge economic costs on the USSR (and later Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) – estimated hundreds of billions of dollars over time – contributing to economic stress. Belarus in particular, which received around 70% of the fallout, spent up to 25% of its national budget on Chernobyl consequences in the late 80s and 90s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In the aftermath of the,Ecology of the Chernobyl Catastrophe" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20the,Ecology%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Catastrophe" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More than 1,borne particles drifted to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More%20than%201,borne%20particles%20drifted%20to" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). This influenced those republics’ politics and relations; for example, arguments over how to pay for Chernobyl recovery were part of the rising tensions in the dissolving Soviet Union. In Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, Chernobyl left a legacy that shaped its environmental and energy policy – the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl (Unit 3) was only shut down in December 2000 as part of an agreement with Western countries that provided financial aid for safer energy projects ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).In summary, the long-term political and geopolitical impact of Chernobyl was far-reaching. It accelerated the end of the Soviet era, prompted a global reckoning on nuclear safety, fostered East-West scientific cooperation, and strengthened international regulatory frameworks. It also invigorated citizen movements and influenced national policies on energy. The world’s nuclear industry after 1986 underwent significant reforms in training, reactor design, risk communication, and emergency planning, all under the shadow of lessons learned from Chernobyl.<br>Right after the explosions, an urgent priority was to extinguish the fires and contain the damage at the power plant. In the early hours of April 26, plant workers and local firefighters rushed to the scene with no full knowledge of the radiation hazard. A fire raged on the roof of Unit 3 (adjacent to the destroyed Unit 4) as well as throughout the wreckage of Unit 4. Fire brigades worked feverishly to douse the flames and keep them from spreading to other reactor buildings. By 5:00 AM, most of the external fires (on the roof and around the building) were extinguished, thanks to these responders – many of whom absorbed massive radiation doses in the process (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). However, inside Reactor 4, the graphite core fire was burning like a giant ember, uncontrollably spewing radiation. It continued to burn for ten days, not fully going out until May 6, 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) when there was no more material left to burn.<br>To combat the reactor fire, the Soviet authorities initiated unprecedented measures. Within 24 hours, the military organized helicopter drops to smother the exposed core. Pilots flew directly over the glowing reactor, dumping load after load of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron into the inferno. In total, more than 5,000 tonnes of these materials were dropped from the air in the weeks after the accident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). It was an incredibly dangerous mission – roughly 600 Soviet helicopter pilots and crew participated, many receiving high radiation doses as they hovered above the destroyed reactor (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The intent was to choke the fire and absorb neutrons to prevent any renewed nuclear chain reaction. (Later analysis suggests much of the dropped material did not stay in the core but the effort likely helped cool and bury the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).) Firefighters also pumped water into the reactor ruins until fears of a steam explosion in the basement halted that approach. Additionally, teams of engineers drained and vented the plant’s steam suppression pools under the reactor (the “bubbler” pools) to remove water and prevent a potential secondary steam explosion that could have ejected even more radioactivity. This harrowing drain operation required three men to enter radioactive flooded corridors – an oft-cited act of bravery (they survived due to quick work and later medical care).<br>Once the immediate crisis of fire and potential further explosions was under control, the focus shifted to cleaning up the massive radioactive mess – a task that would take years. The Soviet Union marshaled an enormous workforce for this, later known as the “liquidators.” These were civil and military personnel conscripted to liquidate (eliminate) the consequences of the accident. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 600,000 people from all over the USSR were officially recognized as Chernobyl liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). They included firefighters, soldiers, engineers, technicians, miners, medical staff, and even volunteers. In 1986–87 alone, about 240,000 recovery workers were on site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). Many were young conscripts in the Soviet Army sent to do manual decontamination work.<br>The liquidators’ tasks were varied and often perilous. In the immediate aftermath, one critical job was to clear the highly radioactive debris from the roof of Unit 3 and the surroundings of Unit 4. Chunks of graphite core and reactor fuel had been hurled onto the rooftops and ground. Radiation on the roof was so intense (up to 10,000 R/hour in some spots) that even 1-2 minutes of exposure could deliver a dangerous dose (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Remote-controlled robots were attempted to shovel debris, but most failed quickly due to the radiation frying their electronics. Thus, human soldiers – dubbed “bio-robots” – had to do it. Working in shifts of only about 40 to 90 seconds each, men sprinted onto the roof, shoveled a few scoops of debris over the edge, and ran back, never to return to that spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1173 Chernobyl liquidators,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1173%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl liquidators from the military%2C,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl%20liquidators%20from%20the%20military%2C,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Each did only one or two trips. By this method, the rooftops were cleared enough to allow construction of the shelter later.<br>Other liquidator crews decontaminated the ground: they used bulldozers and hand tools to scrape up topsoil, which was radioactive, and buried it in trenches. They washed down buildings, roads, and even livestock to remove fallout. A special substance called “Barda” (a sticky resin) was sprayed over large areas by trucks and helicopters to trap radioactive dust and prevent it from re-aerosolizing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters regularly sprayed large areas,2018%2C parked in a field" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters%20regularly%20sprayed%20large%20areas,2018%2C%20parked%20in%20a%20field" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). In Pripyat and other evacuated towns, teams went house to house to collect and dispose of irradiated belongings and to euthanize abandoned pets and livestock (to prevent them from spreading contamination). Miners were brought in to tunnel underneath the reactor; they excavated a cavity and poured concrete to create a cooling slab under the smoldering core (“corium”) lava, to prevent it from melting through to groundwater – this prevented a potential groundwater contamination catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of trees were cut down. Contaminated vehicles, helicopters, and equipment were taken out of service – many were buried or dumped in a vehicle graveyard in the Zone (some remain there to this day, rusting and still radioactive (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The official contaminated zones saw,up effort lasting seven" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20official%20contaminated%20zones%20saw,up%20effort%20lasting%20seven" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>)).<br>The liquidators often worked under harsh, hasty conditions with inconsistent protection. Early on, many were not fully informed of the risks. They wore simple cotton jumpsuits or ill-fitting lead aprons and rudimentary respirators, if anything. As time went on, safety measures improved somewhat, but thousands of liquidators exceeded recommended radiation doses (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1258 ,99" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1258%20,99" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The average dose for the ~600k liquidators is estimated at about 120 mSv (12 rem) per person (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>), which is significant (roughly 50 times a typical yearly background dose). Some individuals, particularly those in 1986 roof and core cleanup, received much higher doses (several Sieverts in a few cases). Many liquidators later suffered health issues, and they are honored today for their sacrifice. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus commemorate Liquidators’ Day (often on December 14, the date in 1986 when the reactor was declared sealed) to remember their contributions. These efforts by the liquidators were crucial in reducing the ongoing risk from Chernobyl – they mitigated what could have been a far worse environmental outcome by working to contain and confine the radioactive materials.<br>A monumental engineering task in 1986 was to entomb the destroyed Reactor 4 to stop further radiation release. Immediately after the accident, Reactor No.4 was an open wound spewing radioactivity, so the Soviet government undertook the construction of a massive containment structure known colloquially as the “sarcophagus.” Design work began just weeks after the accident, and construction started in June 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Despite the extreme conditions, within 206 days – by late November 1986 – the sarcophagus was completed and put in place over Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June 1986 Completed November 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June%201986%20Completed%20November%201986" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The design of the sarcophagus,The seams of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The%20design%20of%20the%20sarcophagus,The%20seams%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). (Some sources cite completion in November, others in early December, but essentially seven months after the disaster.)<br>The sarcophagus was essentially a hastily built steel and concrete shield, erected around the ruins to contain the radiation. It was enormous – over 50 meters tall – and had to be assembled largely by machines and remote welders because radiation levels near the core were deadly. Engineers improvised, often working by remote control or from cranes, to bolt together steel panels and pour concrete over the reactor building’s remains. By its completion, the “Object Ukrytie” (Object Shelter, the official name) encased about 200 tons of radioactive corium (lava-like melted core fuel), plus an estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and debris inside the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building of the Chernobyl Nuclear,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Nuclear,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive contamination of the,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive%20contamination%20%20of%20the,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). This ad-hoc containment prevented these materials from directly escaping to the environment. The sarcophagus also incorporated ventilation to prevent heat and gas buildup, and it sealed off the reactor from rain, which would otherwise leach radioactivity into the ground.<br>Structurally, the sarcophagus was supported in part by the ruined walls of Reactor 4 and was not hermetically tight, but it dramatically reduced radiation emissions from the site. By late 1986, radiation levels around the plant had dropped significantly due to the containment and natural decay of short-lived isotopes. This allowed the other reactors at Chernobyl (Units 1, 2, and 3), which had been shut down after the accident, to be restarted over the next year with added safety upgrades. (They continued operating for years under observation; Reactor 2 was closed in 1991 after a turbine hall fire, Reactor 1 in 1996, and Reactor 3 – the last – in 2000 ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).)<br>The sarcophagus, while a feat given the circumstances, was understood to be a temporary solution with an expected lifespan of perhaps 20–30 years. By the late 1990s, it had deteriorated – the immense radiation and weathering caused cracks and weakened joints. Authorities installed jacks and braces in 1998 to prevent a collapse of the sarcophagus, as it was by then unstable (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Still, it remained an essential barrier keeping the radioactive inventory of Reactor 4 confined. The success of the initial sarcophagus was that it limited the contamination largely within the 30 km Zone and allowed recovery work to continue around the site with manageable radiation levels.<br>Recognizing the sarcophagus was aging, an international plan was developed to provide a more robust, long-term containment. This led to the New Safe Confinement (NSC) – an enormous arch-shaped structure built to enclose the old sarcophagus and reactor building entirely. The NSC was a project funded by a consortium of nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (managed by the EBRD), with design/construction by Novarka (a French-led team). Construction began in 2012. Unlike the original sarcophagus, which was built in place, the NSC was assembled on a clean pad a short distance away and later slid over Reactor 4. By 2016, the colossal assembly was complete, and in November 2016 the entire 36,000-tonne arch was pushed 327 meters on rails to cover the reactor and old sarcophagus (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and preparatory work onsite was,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and%20preparatory%20work%20onsite%20was,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling equipment were fitted in,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling%20equipment%20were%20fitted%20in,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The NSC is designed to last at least 100 years, with a robust steel frame covered by stainless cladding. It is airtight and equipped with cranes and robotic equipment on the inside. The primary purpose of the NSC is not only to keep radioactive dust from escaping, but also to enable the future dismantling of the dangerously unstable old sarcophagus and the removal of the remaining nuclear fuel and debris inside Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The hermetically sealed building will,using as few personnel as" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20hermetically%20sealed%20building%20will,using%20as%20few%20personnel%20as" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

This will be an extremely challenging task, scheduled to take decades – essentially the final phase of cleaning up Chernobyl.<br>With the NSC in place, the site is far more secure. The new structure prevents water intrusion, controls the environment around the reactor (humidity, etc.), and has filter systems to ensure no radioactive particles leak out during future dismantling work. As of today, the NSC has successfully isolated Reactor 4: radiation levels around the plant have declined further, and the risk of the old sarcophagus collapsing (which could have released dust) is mitigated. In February 2022, during the Russian invasion (discussed later), the NSC’s integrity was maintained despite military occupation of the area. A very recent incident on 14 February 2025 saw a drone strike hit the NSC’s roof, breaching its outer and inner steel panels, but radiation levels remained stable and no radioactive release occurred (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This event underscored the NSC’s importance and resilience.<br>In addition to the NSC, other cleanup infrastructure has been built: for example, a new Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISF-2) was constructed to safely store used nuclear fuel from the remaining Chernobyl reactors, completed in 2020 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent nuclear fuel storage facility,and cold tests took place" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent%20nuclear%20fuel%20storage%20facility,and%20cold%20tests%20took%20place" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Waste processing plants and monitoring systems have been established to manage the tons of radioactive waste generated by decommissioning and cleanup. The overall containment strategy is now long-term stewardship: maintain the new shelter, gradually dismantle the old one, remove and dispose of radioactive materials in a safe manner, and ensure the surrounding environment is protected.Through these massive efforts – from the bravery of the 1986 liquidators to the high-tech engineering of the NSC – the Chernobyl site has been transformed from an open reactor wreck to a contained and monitored facility. While full remediation (removal of all radioactive material) will take many more decades if not centuries, the risk of another release has been vastly reduced. Chernobyl has gone from an active crisis to a case of long-term containment, serving as a stark lesson and model in nuclear disaster management.Nearly four decades on, Chernobyl today is a very different place than it was in 1986. The reactor is silent and enclosed, nature has reclaimed much of the evacuated zone, and what was once a symbol of nuclear catastrophe has also become a site of scientific study, remembrance, and even tourism. This section covers the current conditions, including radiation levels, the status of the Exclusion Zone, ecological developments, and human activities like tourism and restoration projects, incorporating the latest available updates.<br>Ambient radiation levels in the Chernobyl region have dropped significantly since 1986, due to radioactive decay and cleanup efforts. Immediately after the accident, radiation in close proximity to the reactor could be fatal within minutes. Today, aside from a few hot spots, most of the Exclusion Zone has radiation levels that are within safe limits for short-term visits. For perspective, normal natural background radiation is about 2 mSv (millisieverts) per year (which is ~0.0002 mSv/hour). In much of the Exclusion Zone, current dose rates are only a few times above background or even equal to background in some areas (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). For example, walking around in Pripyat town for an hour might give a dose on the order of a few microsieverts – negligible in health terms. The ghost city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl plant’s perimeter, and main roads have been sufficiently decontaminated or decayed that short visits are not dangerous with basic precautions. The New Safe Confinement ensures that Reactor 4’s remains emit virtually no radiation into the outside environment; all major radioactive materials are contained within sturdy structures.<br>However, radioactive “hot spots” remain in certain parts of the Exclusion Zone, and these are unsafe for extended exposure or habitation. The most notorious is the Red Forest just west of Reactor 4. Radiation there is still extremely high – on the order of 0.4 mSv per hour (400 µSv/h) in some patches, which is “thousands of times higher than background levels and dangerous to live in” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). A person standing in the Red Forest for an hour could receive as much radiation as they normally would in several months. Needless to say, nobody is allowed to linger there, and it’s off-limits to tourists (even driving through the area, guides take care to roll up windows and not stop). Other localized hot spots include some parts of the reactor complex’s vicinity, areas where radioactive metal equipment lies in the open, or where fallout concentrated in 1986. These spots are well-mapped by authorities; warning signs mark areas of higher radiation.<br>Importantly, the radiation today is not uniform – it’s very heterogeneous. While one spot might be 0.4 mSv/h, a few hundred meters away it might drop to 0.004 mSv/h. Overall, chronic radiation levels have “plummeted” compared to the initial aftermath, and wildlife and even occasional workers can exist in the zone with only low-level exposure outside the hotspots (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether chronic radiation has any,chronically exposed to low levels" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether%20chronic%20radiation%20has%20any,chronically%20exposed%20to%20low%20levels" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Long-lived isotopes like cesium-137 have undergone over one half-life since 1986, meaning roughly half of the initial amount has decayed away. Shorter-lived isotopes (iodine-131, xenon-133, etc.) disappeared long ago. The areas that remain dangerous are primarily those with concentrated transuranic elements (like parts of the reactor debris with plutonium) or where cesium and strontium were deposited most densely (e.g. forest floor litter).<br>As of today, experts consider the Exclusion Zone safe for controlled access – scientists, workers, and tourists routinely enter for limited periods. The key is limiting time in higher-dose areas and not ingesting any contaminated materials (no eating berries or mushrooms from the zone, for example, as they concentrate radionuclides). The Ukrainian authorities have an extensive radiation monitoring network on-site. According to reports, even after incidents like forest fires or military occupation (more on that below), radiation levels remained “within normal limits” for the zone and did not pose a danger outside the immediate area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>A recent real-world “stress test” of Chernobyl’s stability occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl site and occupied the Exclusion Zone for about five weeks. During that time, there were concerns about disturbances to radioactive soil. Indeed, Ukrainian officials reported a spike in gamma radiation readings, likely because Russian military vehicles churned up contaminated dust in the Red Forest with their movements (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) assessed that the rise was localized and levels “remained low and near background levels” in areas where personnel were present (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).

(There were unconfirmed reports of some Russian soldiers later suffering radiation sickness.) Thankfully, despite the tense situation, no major structural damage occurred at Chernobyl’s containment facilities during the occupation. The plant’s power was cut for a time (raising concern about cooling of spent fuel storage), but backup systems and eventual reconnection prevented any incident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L174 The Chernobyl,on safety as a result" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20The%20Chernobyl,on%20safety%20as%20a%20result" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L195 The SNRIU,first time since 23 February" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L195%20The%20SNRIU,first%20time%20since%2023%20February" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). In late March 2022, Russian troops withdrew, and Ukrainian authorities regained control of the site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022 the Zaporizhzhia&nbsp;plant in southeastern" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022%20the%20Zaporizhzhia%C2%A0plant%20in%20southeastern" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). The episode highlighted that Chernobyl, while largely safe and stable, is still a sensitive site that needs protection. It also demonstrated the resilience of the New Safe Confinement and other systems – they withstood the human disruptions without releasing radiation.<br>Another very recent event was the February 2025 drone strike mentioned earlier. A drone (attributed to Russian forces amid the ongoing conflict) detonated on the roof of the NSC. It managed to puncture the outer and inner steel layers of the NSC’s roof in one spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This was a serious incident, but the redundancy of the NSC’s design meant that even with those holes, no radioactive dust escaped. The IAEA confirmed that radiation levels inside and outside the structure stayed normal (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). Repairs are presumably planned to maintain full integrity. This event underscores that while the radiological condition of Chernobyl is under control, human factors and security remain relevant to its safety.In summary, Chernobyl is not a ticking time bomb now, but a contained contaminated site. Current radiation levels in most areas pose minimal risk for brief exposures, and the worst areas are well-restricted. There is no fission or reaction occurring – the reactor fuel is inert and cooling for decades. The main ongoing safety focus is monitoring and managing the remaining radioactive materials to prevent any environmental release (especially during future fuel removal operations). With the new shelter and strong institutional oversight (even during conflict, international eyes like the IAEA are watching Chernobyl), the site’s condition is stable. It is safe enough for scientists, workers, and even tourists, provided regulations are followed, but it remains unsafe for normal habitation or unrestricted land use in the foreseeable future.The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is the officially designated area that surrounds the nuclear plant, from which routine habitation is excluded due to contamination. It was initially a 30 km radius circle, but over time it has been adjusted to cover the regions of highest fallout. Today, the CEZ in Ukraine spans roughly 2,600 km² (1,000 sq miles), an area nearly the size of Luxembourg. It is a mix of forest, marsh, and abandoned villages and towns. To the north, across the border, Belarus maintains its own 2,200 km² Polesie State Radiation-Ecological Reserve – effectively an extension of the Exclusion Zone. Combined, the whole Chernobyl affected zone is about 4,300–4,400 km² of mostly evacuated land. Within the Ukrainian CEZ, the borders are secured by patrols and checkpoints. One cannot simply wander in; access is controlled by the Chernobyl Zone Authority under Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.<br>The zone remains almost completely devoid of permanent residents. In the chaotic months after the disaster, some residents—especially older folks—were heartbroken at the thought of never returning to their homes. Despite official prohibition, a number of evacuees later snuck back into the Exclusion Zone and resettled in their old villages. These people are known as the “samosely” (self-settlers). Over the years, authorities generally tolerated their presence in small numbers. At their peak in the late 80s and early 90s, around 1,200 samosely lived in the zone; today (as of the 2010s), only an aging few dozen to a couple hundred remain, as many have passed away due to old age (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). These residents live mostly in the outer parts of the zone, subsisting off gardens and pensions – they often say they’d rather face radiation in their beloved homes than live in alien cities. They do receive occasional visits from doctors and supplies, but for the most part they live simply and accept whatever risk exists. Their presence is a poignant human facet of the zone, though they are a tiny exception.For everyone else, the Exclusion Zone is a strictly controlled area. The infrastructure of the zone consists of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant industrial site (where a few thousand workers and security personnel commute for monitoring and projects, working in shifts but not living there), and the town of Chernobyl (about 15 km south of the reactor). The town of Chernobyl (not to be confused with the plant itself) actually still functions as an administrative center for the zone – a few hundred staff, scientists, and officers live there on rotations. It has dormitories, an operational canteen, and even two small hotels for visitors. However, this is not a “normal” town – it’s more like a base camp, since everyone there is on limited stay and monitored for radiation dose.The rest of the zone is characterized by abandoned settlements. Pripyat, once a model city of 50,000, remains empty and decaying – an urban time capsule of Soviet life in 1986. Dozens of villages similarly lie in ruins or are being reclaimed by vegetation. Over 200,000 hectares of the zone are wild land with no active human use. There are checkpoints at the 30 km and 10 km boundaries where dosimeters are used to check vehicles for contamination on exit.<br>Economically and administratively, the Exclusion Zone has been put to some new uses in recent years (covered under “Tourism and Development” below, like solar farms and scientific research). But its status is essentially that of a restricted environmental reserve. In 2016 Ukraine designated the Exclusion Zone as a national biosphere radiological reserve, recognizing its unique environment. There has even been discussion by Ukrainian officials of seeking UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Pripyat and Chernobyl’s cultural landscape, to preserve it as a memorial and scientific site. (In 2021, on the 35th anniversary, Ukraine formally started the process to nominate the CEZ as a World Heritage Site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible Unesco World Heritage Site" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible%20Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site" target="_self">Ukraine Seeks to Designate Chernobyl as a Unesco World Heritage ...</a>), though the war has interrupted these plans.)The security of the zone came under threat during the 2022 Russian invasion, as noted. For the first time, armed conflict intruded into the CEZ. During the Russian occupation, not only was there concern of accidental damage, but also reports of looting (even theft of radioactive lab samples) and disruption of wildfire management. Post-occupation, Ukraine has to demine parts of the zone due to mines left behind. The episode highlighted that the Exclusion Zone remains important strategically – it was a pathway for Russian forces towards Kyiv. After Russian withdrawal, Ukraine reasserted full control and the zone is back to being off-limits except for authorized personnel. The IAEA now has a permanent monitoring presence at Chernobyl as well.In conclusion, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone persists as a largely evacuated territory. It functions as a combination of a radiological reserve, an outdoor laboratory, a memorial landscape, and a buffer around the reactor site. With each passing year, the zone’s identity shifts more towards preservation and research. It stands as a remarkable example of how a large area, once meant for human habitation, has transformed following a technological disaster. Current conditions ensure that the zone will remain set apart for many years to come – a place where time stopped in 1986, now gradually being reclaimed by nature, and cautiously visited by those seeking to understand and remember Chernobyl’s lessons.One of the most intriguing aspects of Chernobyl today is its thriving wildlife and transformed ecosystem. As mentioned in the long-term effects section, the removal of humans has allowed many animal populations to rebound dramatically. The Exclusion Zone has effectively become a wildlife sanctuary – arguably one of the most unexpected nature preserves in the world.<br>Surveys and field research in the 2010s documented an abundance of large mammals. Wolves are considered the top predator in Chernobyl’s food chain now, and they range freely. A 2015 census using track counts and helicopter surveys found that Chernobyl’s wolf population was several times higher than in nearby non-contaminated reserves; prey like deer and wild boar were also plentiful (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The researchers reported “no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance” in the zone, noting that wildlife was doing well in the absence of people (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). This is not to say radiation has no effects, but any potential subtle effects have not prevented populations from growing. Another study published in 2015 in Current Biology concluded the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a “unique sanctuary for wildlife” with greater biodiversity than before the accident, due to human absence (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).Numerous species have returned to the area. For instance, the Eurasian lynx, absent in the region for decades due to hunting and habitat loss, now prowls the forests again. Brown bears have been observed moving through the zone (these had long been gone from this part of Ukraine). The European bison, an endangered species, was introduced to the Ukrainian zone in the 2010s and has since formed a small herd. Przewalski’s horses – critically endangered wild horses native to Central Asia – were released in the late 1990s as an experiment; they thrived and now about 100 of them roam the grasslands near Pripyat, grazing around abandoned villages. Elk (moose) populations are stable, and wild boar are so numerous that they spill out of the zone into surrounding farmland. Birdlife is rich as well: species like black storks, white-tailed eagles, eagle owls, and others are commonly seen. Even rare species like the globally threatened Greater Spotted Eagle have been recorded nesting in the zone. The wetlands in the Pripyat River floodplain inside the CEZ serve as important habitat for migratory birds. Lakes and ponds hold healthy fish populations (famously, the cooling pond of the plant has giant catfish that tourists love to watch – though their size is due to age and lack of fishing, not “mutations”).<br>Scientists continue to study these animals to see how chronic radiation exposure might be affecting them. Some findings are intriguing: for example, Chernobyl’s birds have been found to adapt by producing more anti-oxidants to counter radiation’s oxidative stress. A study on Chernobyl’s wolves has even tracked them leaving the zone, suggesting the zone might be a source of animals repopulating other areas (raising the question of whether they could carry mutations outward – though no evidence of any harmful spread has been observed). Another recent study (2023) on roundworms in the soil found that even after 1,000 generations in Chernobyl’s radionuclide-laden earth, the worms showed an ability to tolerate the radiation without significant genome damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the resurgence of a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the%20resurgence%20of%20a" target="_self">From disaster zone to living laboratory: Chernobyl provides test bed ...</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation,genomes of microscopic worms" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny%20Worms%20Tolerate%20Chornobyl%20Radiation,genomes%20of%20microscopic%20worms" target="_self">Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation - NYU</a>). This hints at potential resilience or repair mechanisms developed by life in the zone.That said, not every creature is thriving. Invertebrates and small mammals have shown mixed results in studies – some have reduced populations in high radiation sectors. Tree growth can be stunted in those areas. There have been reports of some partial “mutations” or anomalies: for instance, a higher frequency of albino barn swallows, or rodents with cataracts. But overall, the ecosystem functions: trees grow, leaves decompose (albeit slower at first), water bodies have oxygen and life, and a full trophic web (plants → herbivores → carnivores) is in place.The Exclusion Zone’s ecology has also benefited from deliberate protections. Since people aren’t farming or logging, forests have matured and expanded. In Belarus’s Polesie Reserve, there are large tracts of primeval-feeling forest that are home to lynx and wolves. Ukraine’s side set up the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve to coordinate ecological conservation and research.<br>Interestingly, the zone provides a case study on rewilding – showing how quickly wildlife can reclaim an area when humans leave. Within 5-10 years of the evacuation, animals from surrounding regions started moving in. Now, Chernobyl is cited as evidence that nature can be remarkably resilient. The United Nations Environment Programme noted that the land around Chernobyl has become “a haven for wildlife” in the absence of human activity (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers have found the land,become a haven for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20the%20land,become%20a%20haven%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">How Chernobyl has become an unexpected haven for wildlife - UNEP</a>). Some have even called it Europe’s own Serengeti (though that’s hyperbole; it is a rich temperate forest ecosystem, not a tropical savanna).It’s crucial to remember the wildlife success does not mean radiation is “good” for animals – rather, it underscores how damaging human habitation can be for wildlife, by comparison. Chernobyl removed the anthropogenic pressures (hunting, farming, pollution other than radiation), and wildlife moved in despite the radiation risk. The long-term genetic consequences for these animal populations are still being studied. But as of now, the biosphere of Chernobyl is vibrant. Visitors often report seeing tracks of wolves and boar everywhere, hearing bird songs in empty villages, or even catching sight of a wild horse galloping across the steppe. It’s a striking contrast: a site of human catastrophe has, over time, transformed into an “accidental wilderness.”<br>In summary, the current ecosystem in the Chernobyl area is a mixture of contamination and regeneration. Forests have overtaken former towns; animals roam where people once worked and played. The zone stands as a unique refuge for biodiversity in Eastern Europe, with higher wildlife abundance than before 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Ongoing research in this living laboratory will continue to inform us about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation on living organisms and about nature’s capacity for resilience after human departure.In recent years, Chernobyl has evolved into a destination for controlled tourism and a site for innovative projects aimed at finding some positive purpose for the Exclusion Zone. Disaster tourism, or “dark tourism,” has grown around Chernobyl, driven by curiosity, education, and the eerie allure of its post-apocalyptic landscape. At the same time, Ukraine has launched efforts to utilize the zone for renewable energy and scientific advancement, turning a place of tragedy into one of renewal.<br>Tourism: In 2011, Ukraine officially opened Chernobyl to tourism, recognizing the public interest and the zone’s educational value (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2011 Chernobyl was officially,tourist attraction%2C with many visitors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202011%20Chernobyl%20was%20officially,tourist%20attraction%2C%20with%20many%20visitors" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Since then, visiting Chernobyl has been possible via licensed tour operators. Tourists must apply in advance, submit their passport details (since it’s a secure area), and they enter on guided tours usually from Kyiv. These tours stick to relatively safe routes; visitors carry dosimeters and are briefed on safety (like not touching vegetation, not sitting on the ground, etc.). Typical tours include stops at the Chernobyl town (to see memorials and equipment graveyards), the Kopachi village ruins (where only a kindergarten building remains as a reminder), the Pripyat city (where one can carefully walk the deserted streets and see sites like the abandoned amusement park, swimming pool, and overgrown city square), and a distant view of the Reactor 4 complex and NSC from a safe distance. Some tours also visit the giant Duga-1 radar (“Russian Woodpecker”) – a huge abandoned Soviet radar installation in the zone. Tourists pass through radiation control gates when exiting to ensure they haven’t inadvertently picked up contamination (in practice, brief visitors rarely do).<br>Chernobyl tourism remained somewhat niche until the late 2010s when it saw a boom. The success of the 2019 HBO “Chernobyl” miniseries brought a surge of interest – tour agencies reported bookings jumping by 30-40% after the show aired (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One Chernobyl tour agency reported,which has attracted outstanding" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One%20Chernobyl%20tour%20agency%20reported,which%20has%20attracted%20outstanding" target="_self">HBO show success drives Chernobyl tourism boom - Reuters</a>). In 2018, roughly 70,000 tourists visited Chernobyl; in 2019, that number swelled to around 120,000 – 125,000 visitors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl sees a spike in,to the 70%2C000 in 2018" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl%20sees%20a%20spike%20in,to%20the%2070%2C000%20in%202018" target="_self">Chernobyl sees a spike in visitors as pop culture influences tourism</a>).

These visitors come from all over the world, drawn by historical interest, a taste for adventure, or even wildlife photography. The Ukrainian government even considered expanding tourist infrastructure given the demand.Tourism has had positive effects: it raises awareness of the disaster’s lessons and provides income (each visitor pays fees that support zone maintenance and local communities outside the zone). Guides emphasize that Chernobyl is a site of remembrance – there are memorials to firefighters and evacuees, and many tours include meeting an actual evacuee or a liquidator who can share their story. Visitors are often struck by the poignancy of places like Pripyat: an empty nursery with children’s toys still there, or murals peeling off school walls – snapshots of 1980s Soviet life frozen in time. This “open-air museum” aspect is why preservationists have pushed for UNESCO status, to protect it from decay and looting.Tourism was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again in 2022 because of the war. As of 2023, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tourist access is suspended for security reasons. But prior to that, Chernobyl had firmly established itself as a tourist destination, and it likely will again when conditions normalize. It’s not a Disneyfied experience – the trips are somber and heavily managed – but it provides a powerful insight into nuclear history and its consequences.Restoration and Development Projects: While the land will be unsafe for farming or regular habitation for a long time, Ukraine has sought creative ways to utilize the Exclusion Zone. One idea has been to turn it into a hub for renewable energy. The reasoning: the zone has abundant land that cannot be used for agriculture, and it has existing high-voltage power lines (from when the plant generated electricity) that connect to the grid. So, why not install solar panels or wind turbines there?<br>In 2018, the first project materialized – a 1 megawatt solar power plant was built within sight of the old reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The new one,first years of its operation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The%20new%20one,first%20years%20of%20its%20operation" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Installed by a Ukrainian-German company, this solar farm consists of about 3,800 photovoltaic panels on a 1.6 hectare plot, right near the Chernobyl plant. It was connected to the grid and, symbolically, began generating power again at Chernobyl (the first electricity from the site since the last reactor shut down in 2000) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It is the first time,would never produce energy again" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20first%20time,would%20never%20produce%20energy%20again" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). This small solar station powers about 2,000 homes, and plans were floated for expansion. The Ukrainian government has actively promoted the Exclusion Zone as a site for renewable energy projects, pitching that up to 2.5 GW of solar capacity could eventually be installed (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Interest was shown by companies from China, France, and other countries in building solar farms in the late 2010s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). The cheap land (effectively free, since it’s unusable for other purposes) and existing transmission lines make it economically attractive – with the caveat that construction workers can only spend limited hours in the area for safety (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two years ago%2C a giant,reactor to be dismantled safely" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20giant,reactor%20to%20be%20dismantled%20safely" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).<br>Similarly, in 2021 Ukraine announced plans for a large wind farm in the Exclusion Zone. In partnership with a European company, they envision up to 1 GW of wind energy capacity to be developed in the zone (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear option%3A Ukraine plans one,around the Chernobyl nuclear plant" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear%20option%3A%20Ukraine%20plans%20one,around%20the%20Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant" target="_self">Nuclear option: Ukraine plans one of Europe's largest wind farms in ...</a>). If realized, that would make it one of Europe’s biggest onshore wind farms. Such a project would further transform Chernobyl from a symbol of nuclear disaster into a contributor to clean energy production (without the risks of nuclear). As of the latest updates, these plans are on hold due to the war, but Ukraine has indicated strong interest in resuming them once it’s safe.Besides energy, the zone is used for scientific research and environmental monitoring. Ecologists, biologists, and radiologists from around the world work in the CEZ to study radiation effects on nature, remediation techniques, and even astrophysics (the low light pollution makes it good for certain telescopic observations). There have been projects to test robotic equipment for radiation mapping, to experiment with phytoremediation (using plants to extract radionuclides from soil), and to monitor wildfires via satellites. The zone’s administration also employs people in forestry (they actively manage some forests to reduce fire risk, by removing dry fuel). Some contaminated wood is harvested under careful conditions and used as biomass fuel in special power plants (with filtration) outside the zone – a bit controversial, but an attempt to utilize resources while controlling pollution.One notable “restoration” in a cultural sense is the preservation of certain buildings. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself still has workers doing decommissioning. Tours can visit the control room of Reactor 4 now (in full gear, for a short 5-minute look) – it was opened to very limited visiting in 2019 as part of raising awareness. The control room is, of course, contaminated and everything inside remains as it was after the accident (now with higher radiation levels), so such visits are symbolic. There is also the Chernobyl Museum in Kiev (Kyiv) which is outside the zone but dedicated to its history.One can’t mention restoration without noting that Chernobyl will never be “restored” to its pre-1986 state in the literal sense. The goal is more about containment and adaptation. The current strategy (per international plans) is to keep the reactor area safe and start removing the fuel debris between now and 2065, package the waste, and then possibly begin to dismantle the NSC and other structures after that. Meanwhile, large parts of the Exclusion Zone may be left to nature indefinitely. Some areas with lower contamination could potentially be opened for limited use sooner – for example, a few outer villages were reclassified in the 2010s to allow former residents to visit or even live with some restrictions (particularly in parts of Belarus). But for the most contaminated core zones, the “no man’s land” will persist for many generations – essentially as a wildlife reserve and historical monument.Latest updates (as of early 2025): The war in Ukraine has introduced uncertainties – for instance, the renewable projects are paused, and the zone occasionally faces security issues. But the NSC and other safety systems are functioning. Ukraine’s government remains committed to integrating the zone into its future plans (President Zelensky in 2020 declared Chernobyl a place of “special importance” that should be turned from a negative into a positive symbol). There’s talk of developing better infrastructure for tourists and researchers once it’s feasible.Chernobyl has also become part of global pop culture and education. Documentaries and movies abound. The site draws not only tourists but also journalists, scientists, and even video game designers (the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is set in a fictionalized Chernobyl zone). This human engagement with Chernobyl today is part of its ongoing story – ensuring that the lessons of 1986 are not forgotten and that maybe something constructive can arise from the tragedy.<br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was a cataclysmic event with causes rooted in design flaws and human error, producing immediate devastation to human life and the environment. Its immediate consequences included loss of life, widespread radioactive contamination, and political upheaval. Over the long term, it has had complex health outcomes (notably thousands of thyroid cancers, but surprisingly limited other health impacts according to UNSCEAR) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), and it left a profound mark on ecology – decimating some aspects of the environment while inadvertently creating a wildlife haven. The disaster also influenced geopolitical currents, hastening the Soviet Union’s end and reshaping global nuclear policy.Cleanup efforts were unprecedented in scale – from the half-million liquidators who risked their health, to the massive engineering feats of containment with the sarcophagus and New Safe Confinement. Today, Chernobyl stands in a state of stable containment: radiation is largely confined, Reactor 4 is entombed under the new arch, and the area is under constant monitoring. The surrounding Exclusion Zone has transformed into a unique sanctuary for biodiversity and a living museum of the anthropocene. Current radiation levels in most of the zone are low enough to allow visits, although the land will not be fully “clear” for normal life for centuries in the most affected parts.<br>Chernobyl’s story is still unfolding – it’s a story of warning about the dangers of nuclear power without proper safety, but also a story of resilience (of people and nature). Efforts continue in making the site useful – whether generating solar electricity or providing invaluable scientific data on radiation’s effects. As of today, Chernobyl is both a monument to a past disaster and a dynamic environment of recovery. It remains a sobering reminder of the costs of human error, and a testament to international cooperation in mitigating a disaster’s aftermath. The legacy of Chernobyl is reflected in safer nuclear industry practices (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), in the lives of survivors and evacuees, and in the lush forests where wolves now howl in a zone once poisoned by fallout.The name “Chernobyl” will forever conjure images of catastrophe, but it also stands for the knowledge gained at great cost and the enduring hope that even the worst environments can find a form of healing over time.Sources:
