'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .2 (weak)
r = ± .4 (moderate)
r = ± .8 (strong)
It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .1 (weak)
r = ± .3 (moderate)
r = ± .5 (strong) R-squared = .448 in the example above. 44.8% of the variation in kid's scores on the cognitive test is accounted for by their mother's IQ. Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts:
- What we can explain by the model (regression)
- What we still cannot explain (error)<br>
<a data-href="Mediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mediation</a> Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV?
Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: β1 = 0
H1: β1 ≠ 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: ρ &gt; 0
H0: ρ2 = 0
H1: ρ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br>For the example, the Omnibus test results in the ANOVA table show that the model significantly predicts the <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>, (F(1,432) = 108.643, p &lt; .001)

<br>MLR is used when you want to understand the relationship between one <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> and two or more <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. It is commonly applied in scenarios such as: Predicting Outcomes For example, predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Understanding Relationships For example, analyzing how factors like advertising spend, produce price, and customer satisfaction influence sales. Controlling for Confounding Variables For example, studying the effect of education level on income while controlling for age and work experience. <br>The residuals (errors) have constant <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> across all levels of <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> s. How to Check Plot residuals vs. Predicted values
Look for a random scatter.
In SPSS: request Linear Regression Plots. Y &gt; ZPred
X &gt; Z Resid
If the scatterplot shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met. <br><img alt="Testing Homoscedasticity Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-homoscedasticity-example.png" target="_self"> Example Check if the spread of residuals is consistent across predicted house prices.

Utilize Cook's Distance under the 'Residuals Statistics' Table<br>
<img alt="Testing for Extreme Outliers.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-extreme-outliers.png" target="_self">
If the maximum Cook's distance is below 1.0, then the assumption is met.
Other tests may give a different cutoff point, but for our purposes we will use 1.0. Testing for Extreme Outliers
An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <br><img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" target="_self"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File
Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above. Testing for Normality
<br>Observations are independent of each other (no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>)
How to Check Use the Durbin-Watson test. If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 - 2.5, the assumption is met. Examples <br><img alt="Testing the Independence of Error.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-the-independence-of-error.png" target="_self"> For this example, we'll say 1.482 is close enough to 1.5 and the assumption is met.

The capacity to maintain one's own identity (thoughts, values, and beliefs) while remaining emotionally connected to others. <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> introduced this concept to explain how individuals manage anxiety and stress by separating thinking from emotional reactivity. Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. Example. An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. Example. An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. Example. A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. Clinical implication Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/final-project/project-outline.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/Final Project/Project Outline.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:33:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Struggling Students]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/family-development-(2200)/struggling-students.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Family Development (2200)/Struggling Students.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:46:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family Development (2200)]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/family-development-(2200)/family-development-(2200).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Family Development (2200)/Family Development (2200).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:46:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Assignment 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[This classwork/homework assignment is a multiple imputation activity. You will continue to use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2011 Cohort.&nbsp;The classwork/homework write-up is due by Tuesday at 11:59PM (3/18).&nbsp;The data you need come from two sources. The first is the data file you have been working on for class activities the last several week. The second is located in this week's folder. A researcher wants to know whether maternal depressive symptoms are associated with children’s early learning and development. But before the researcher can address this question, you are asked to think about and address missing data. The researcher has provided you with several variables in addition to the variables you have worked with thus far:
You are asked to include an overall composite of depressive symptoms. The research provides you with 12 items that you are asked to composite (P2BOTHER P2APPETI P2BLUE P2KPMIND P2DEPRES P2EFFORT P2FEARFL P2RESTLS P2TALKLS P2LONELY P2SAD P2NOTGO).
You will also include three child variables: a) a variable capturing children’s academic achievement, b) a variable capturing children’s socioemotional skills, and c) a variable capturing children’s executive functioning. For the academic achievement measure, you will need to create a new composite variable that is composed of reading, math, and science (X2RSCALK4 X2MSCALK4 X2SSCALK4). For socioemotional skills, you will need to create a new variable that is the average of teacher reports of self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior (i.e.,&nbsp;X2TCHINT X2TCHEXT X2TCHCON X2TCHPER). Children’s executive functioning skills are captured with a single item:&nbsp;X2DCCSTOT.
The researcher also wants you to include covariates/indicators for race/ethnicity (X_RACETH_R), child sex (X_CHSEX_R), income (X2INCCAT_I), parents’ marital status (P1CURMAR), parents physical health (P2HEALTH), household members under 18 (X1LESS18), and household members over 18 (X1OVER18) .
With that in mind...Step 1: You need to merge the new data into the dataset you have been working with. This requires a 1 to 1 merge using CHILDID. This step will be graded via your do/log files (.25 points)Step 2: Once the data are merged, examine your data. Orient yourself to the old and new variables (e.g., are they continuous, categorical etc etc) and&nbsp;recode&nbsp;any new variables as appropriate. Recall how Stata recognizes missing data. Please also&nbsp;create&nbsp;the appropriate composites&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to imputation. The composites will be what you will use in your imputation.&nbsp;If you recode other variables, please provide a justification. This step will be graded via your do/log files and your justification in your word document. (.25 points) Step 3: Once you have cleaned your data,&nbsp;run&nbsp;some descriptives for all of your variables (including your covariates) and determine the degree of missing values for each variable. Please also estimate a correlation matrix for your focal independent and dependent variables (do&nbsp;not&nbsp;include the list of covariates for your correlation matrix). What &nbsp;patterns you notice from the descriptive statistics? How much missing data are there for the variables? What patterns do you notice from the correlation matrix? (1.00 point) Step 4:&nbsp;Determine&nbsp;whether data are MCAR. Examine and discuss the missing data patterns. Are there common patterns of missing data? Are there uncommon patterns of missing data? Anything you notice worth discussing? If data are not MCAR, discuss whether the data may meet assumptions of MAR or MNAR. Why or why not? If you have any concerns proceeding to imputation, discuss it here. (1.25 points) Step 5:&nbsp;Run&nbsp;an imputation model with 10 datasets. Make sure you specify each variable correctly. And remember to&nbsp;upload&nbsp;your do and log files (for the entire assignment). This step will be graded via your do file (1.00 point) Step 6: After you have run your imputation,&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;descriptives&nbsp;within&nbsp;the 10 imputed datasets. You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to do this for every variable. Run these descriptives for the focal variables of interest (depressive symptoms, children's academic achievement, social skills, and executive functioning). Use the mi xeq command (e.g., mi xeq: sum XYZ). Discuss what you notice about the means/SDs across the imputations. (1.00 point)Step 7.&nbsp;Estimate&nbsp;correlations (use mi xeq: corr) among your focal variables from step 1, but this time&nbsp;within&nbsp;your 10 datasets. Are there any similarities between the imputed and non-imputed data? Are there any other differences you notice? (.75 points) Step 8. Upload your word document, log file, and do file. Please upload stata versions of your log/do files (not copied/pasted into word).]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Assignment 4.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:51:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mediation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mediation" data-href="Mediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Single Mediation</a><br>

Mediation examines how the effect of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) is transmitted through a third variable, called the mediator (M). In simple mediation, there is one mediator. To determine if the IV influences the DV directly and/or indirectly via the mediator. The model splits the total effect into The portion of the effect of IV on DV that is not explained by the mediator. The portion of the effect that is transmitted from IV to DV through the mediator. Relationships among IV, mediator, and DV are linear. Scatterplots: Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot and plot DV vs. IV and DV vs. M. Look for a straight-line pattern. Residuals vs. Predicted Plot: Run Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear…; click Plots… to assign standardized predicted values (X-axis) and standardized residuals (Y-axis).
Criteria: No systematic pattern (i.e., randomness, with any curve test yielding p &gt; .05). Residuals have constant variance across all levels of predictors. Examine the same residuals vs. predicted plot for an even spread (no funnel shape). Residuals are approximately normally distributed. Create histograms and Q–Q plots using Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram or Q–Q plot options. Criteria: Skewness values less than |2.0| and kurtosis values less than |7.0|; Q–Q plot points should lie near the diagonal line. Observations are independent. Confirm via your study design.
Review the Durbin–Watson statistic from your regression output (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable). There are no unmeasured variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and DV. This is primarily a design issue; however, consider including control variables if needed. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX by Andrew Hayes
Choose Model 4 (designed for simple mediation).
Set the DV, IV, and mediator in the appropriate boxes.
Enable bootstrapping (commonly set to 5,000 samples) to obtain robust confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effect.
Click OK. Direct Path (IV → M): Example: a = 0.40, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path from Mediator to DV (M → DV, controlling for IV): Example: b = 0.50, SE = 0.12, p = .002 Indirect Effect (a × b): Example: 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.200.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.08, 0.35] (does not include zero → significant mediation). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for M):
Example: c′ = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005
Total Effect (IV → DV without mediator):
Example: c = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001 A mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to examine whether [Mediator] mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The total effect of [IV] on [DV] was significant (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001). When [Mediator] was entered into the model, the direct effect decreased (b = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005). The indirect effect was significant (b = 0.20, SE = 0.07, 95% CI [0.08, 0.35]), indicating that [Mediator] partially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator(s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV → Mediator 1 → DV IV → Mediator 2 → DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. each mediator.
Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a1 = 0.30, b1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a2 = 0.25, b2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.” Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. predicted plots for each link: IV → M1, M1 → M2, and M2 → DV.
Use histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M1 influences M2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M2 on M1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
Click Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV → Mediator 1: Example: a1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M1):
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
Sequential Indirect Effect (IV → M1 → M2 → DV):
Calculation: a1 × d × b2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):
Example: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation. Check Assumptions in SPSS: Generate scatterplots, residual vs. predicted plots, histograms, and Q–Q plots.
Verify diagnostic values: skewness (&lt; |2.0|), kurtosis (&lt; |7.0|), Durbin–Watson (1.5–2.5), and inter-mediator correlations (r &lt; 0.80 for parallel mediation).
For serial mediation, confirm intermediate regression steps are significant (p &lt; .05). Conduct Mediation Analysis with PROCESS: Use the appropriate model: Model 4 for simple and parallel mediation; Model 6 for serial mediation.
Enter variables as specified and enable bootstrapping (commonly 5,000 samples) to generate 95% confidence intervals. Interpret Output: Evaluate p-values for each path (significant if p &lt; .05).
For indirect effects, confirm that bootstrapped confidence intervals do not include zero. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/Mediation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 21:32:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[7. Sampling & Complex Designs]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Why should we strive for population representative sampling? Important for policy or practice. We do not want to recommend changes that are not based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact. How? Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)
Work on large teams
Use secondary data Normally used to compensate for over- and under-sampling of individuals
Example It is common to over-sample minority groups... If we doubled the size of our minority sample, then each minority case would get a design weight of 1/2 or .5. We use the design weight when we want the statistics to be representative of the population. Used to compensate for the fact that persons with certain characteristics are not as likely to respond to the survey. Example Most population surveys have substantially more female than male respondents; because surveys over-represents females and under-represents males in the population, a weight is used to compensate for this bias. There are many responsent characteristics that are likely to be related to the propensity to respond such as age, education, race/ethnicity, place of residence. Dataset with cases Simple mean (4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 2.8 Weighted mean {(4 1) + (2 2) + (1 4) + (5 1) + (2 * 2)} / 10 = 2.1 With unweighted data, each case is counted equally
With weighted data, each case is counted relative to its representation in the population
Unweighted data represent only those in the sample who provide data
Weights allow analyses that represent the target population
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs.png" target="_self"> Most STATA commands can deal with weighted data, where the weight is a variable in the dataset. You need to specify the type of weight and the weight variable, using brackets at the end of your command, as in:
summarize x [weight=weightvarname]
tab x [weight=weightvarname]
regress y x [weight=weightvarname]
There are 4 types of weights in STATA, but for most data analyses you will use one of the following: Probability pweights, for observations sampled with unequal probability of selection. Use this for inferential analyses.
Analytic aweights, for data containing averages where the average is weighted by the # obs used in calculating the average…. Use this for your descriptive statistics. <br><img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-1.png" target="_self">
Different studies create different types of weights... Some data create weights depending on: Level of analysis (child, teacher, or school)
Type of analysis (cross-sectional vs. Longitudinal)
Source of data (child assessment, parent interview, teacher questionnaires, etc.)
For example, the ECLS-K has ~ 105 different options Many suggest you use combination weights when estimating longitudinal analyses because they assume that these users will not adjust for attrition on their own. I suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights. Instead, use modern missing data procedures for attrition bias, and use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias I make this recommendation because attrition weights have two key disadvantages Attrition weights often reduce the analytical sample size, and thereby, statistical power. If many non-model variables related to missing data are incorporated, missing data techniques adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights Use weights whenever possible, but some methods do not allow weights
Steps to follow to avoid vias in unweighted analyses <br>Include as <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> that might account for the sample design or non-response
<br>If a weight is available, it can also be included as an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a>
If the weight is associated with the outcom ein a model including the design variables, then the weight is likely to have been constructed in a way related to your outcome; bias is possile. E.g., some multilevel models, some structural equation programs, etc. National samples are first divided into primary sampling units... What these units are depends on the study.
- E.g., in many data of the US the PSUs are geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-2.png" target="_self"> After identifying PSUs, then PSUs are stratified into groups. These groups are formed to keep similar units together... How many and what types of strata are determined by study goals.<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-3.png" target="_self">
Then within each strata, and within PSUs, you sample Software can make the adjustment... A few different approaches with the easiest being the Taylor Series approach Use primary sampling unit (PSU) and strata variables in the data file. The strata and PSU identifiers are often associated with a specific sampling weight variable. For example, in the ECLS-K the weight C1CW0 has the following strata and PSU: C1TVWSTR and C1TCWPSU svyset PSU [pweight = WEIGHT], strata(STRATA)
Then use svy: before your subsequent commands (e.g., svy: tab or svy: mean or svy: regress)
svy: will NOT work with all commands
svy: mean and mean [weight = weight] yield the same mean estimates… it is the SEs that are different)<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-4.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-4.png" target="_self"><br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-5.png" target="_self"> Weights should be used when analyzing data from national samples; otherwise, you cannot make claims about representativeness
The appropriate weight should be selected based on: Level of analysis
Round (s) of data
Source (s) of data There may not be a 'perfect' weight for many analyses
All statistical tests should be based on standard errors that account for complex sample design

Variable Selection &amp; Data Relationships-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/6.-variable-selection-&amp;-data-relationships-2.png" target="_self"> As you are making decisions regarding your variables, consider the following questions: How will constructs be operationalized?
What items will be used and which measures are critical to the tests?
If multiple measures are available, what will be done? These issues often require quite a bit of conceptual considerations and defending in the peer-review process. In big datasets, measures are often abbreviated. Measurement problems arise when The concept to be measured are vague or poorly defined
Indicators are imperfect measures of the underlying construct
Individual responses are inaccurate (e.g., distraction, illness, poor comprehension)

The vast majority of constructs require more than one item, Why? Low content validity (sensitivity and reliability) The primary objective of creating a series of composite scales is to avoid the exclusive use of, or dependence on, single item constructs where possible.

Why do we test for reliability in subpopulations? Establish the psychometric properties of a new or existing measure/assessment tool Means for determining generalizeability
Are we measuring the same construct in the same way across groups or across time? Increase confidence that observed differences between groups reflect true differences and not those ties to measurement. Reliability within subgroups is often assumed but rarely tested and is a big issue for many datasets that do not use previously validated meaures. Why use existing composites? Data availability: you often may not have all necessary data to create the composite
Reproducibility: everyone uses the same construct
Convenience: time and effort spent on identifying possible composites and determining best source of information to creating them But first, always read the user's guide and when item level data are available, check yourself!

Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. Predicted plots for each link: IV → M 1, M 1 → M 2, and M 2 → DV.
Use histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M 1 influences M 2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M 2 on M 1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
Click Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV → Mediator 1: Example: a 1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M 1):
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
Sequential Indirect Effect (IV → M 1 → M 2 → DV):
Calculation: a 1 × d × b 2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):
Example: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation.

Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator (s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV → Mediator 1 → DV IV → Mediator 2 → DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. Each mediator.
Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. Predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a 1 = 0.30, b 1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a 2 = 0.25, b 2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.”

Although there is a positive effect of mom_iq on kidscore, the magnitude of the effect (the slope) is higher for children whose parents did not graduate high school (the blue line). Let's say that we have a theory that the more time you spend with a puppy, the happier you are. Also, the amount of love you have for puppies will moderate that effect. We will use the puppy_love dataset to run this scenario in PROCESS, but there are a few things to note: Make sure all variables you are using are 8 characters or less in length

This first part of the output shows us the model we built including the model number, our N, and the model summary. Model summary includes the R2 value, which in this case shows a significant amount of variance explained (37.63%) Below, in the 'Model' table, you can see the coefficients for the intercept as well as for the slopes of Dose, Love of Puppies, and the automatically created interaction term. Just below that you see that the interaction term is dose x puppylove<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-15.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-15.png" target="_self"> This next significant table shows us the conditional effects of W at the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentiles. Here, we see that when puppy love is at the 16 th percentile (puppy love = 1), the effect is 1.81 (p = .0013). Likewise, when puppy love is at the 50 th percentile (2.5), the effect is also significant (p = .0046) at 1.1694. However, the effect is no longer significant at the 84 th percentile for puppy love, (p &gt; .05).<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-16.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-16.png" target="_self"> The next table is the Johnson-Newman results. The Johnson-Newman approach looks for the values of W, where the p-values of the conditional effect changes to above/below the chosen significance level (. 05). So, it looks for the values of W that cause t-crit value to equal zero for when determining the conditional effect of X, where the p-value is exactly the alpha, or .05 in most cases. At what values of W, do the results go from significant to non-significant, or vice-versa, in terms of conditional effect?
Your results can either be of one, two, or zero values. If there is one value, that means there is only one value of W where the conditional effect either becomes significant or loses significance. If there are two values, that means there are two points at which W will change in significance. This will either mean the middle range is significant, but not the high and low values of W, or that the high and low values of W are significant, but not the middle range. The middle range is determined by the W values themselves. If there are no values, then the conditional effect is either always significant or never significant for all values of W. Next are graphical representations for what different types of Johnson-Newman results may look like. Where the line cross .05, that's where this approach looks for the value of W, giving us more insight into what extent our moderator... Well, moderates.<br>

See that the Johnson-Newman technique gave us only one value, 3.3364. By finding the value in the table below, we can see that the conditional effect is significant before W = 3.3364, but non-significant after that point. So, it is significant with lower levels of puppy love. (First column, row 3.3364)<br>

Conditional Process Analysis-20.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-20.png" target="_self"> The moderator (puplove) has significant impact on the relationship between time spent with Puppies and Happiness, only at its low values (i.e., from 0.00 to 3.3364) This implies that, the less an individual loves a puppy, the more time spent with puppy affect (increases) their happiness. At its higher values, the moderator (puplove) does not have a significant effect on the relationship between time spent with Puppies (focal predictor) and Happiness (outcome variable) This implies that, increasing the time spent with Puppy does not affect/change (increases) happiness for individuals who already love Puppies. The next part of the table give us the syntax to generate the plot<br>

<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-24.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-24.png" target="_self">
This is what your chart should look like now. You can now have lines that can help you to visualize the changes in X vs. Y, given the subgroups of W. Pretend that literature shows that the more someone loves puppies, the happier they are. We would like to test that theory, but with a moderator of time spent with puppies during a trial (dose).
Here, we are recognizing that Dose is a multi-categorical variable for control group (0 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes with puppies).
Typically, we would need to dummy-code these variables, but PROCESS does it for you, provided you remember one extra step. First, set up the model as usual in PROCESS. Note. Where the variables are in the image based on the new hypothesis. Next click on 'Multicategorical'<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-25.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-25.png" target="_self">
The next pop-up you will get is the multicategorical box. Here, you will select the checkbox under 'Variable W' to indicate that your moderator is multicategorical. Note. The other options, indicating that you can also do this for any X or Z variables(s) that have 3 or more categories. Click Continue.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-26.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-26.png" target="_self">
Click OK. One of the changes is the dummy coding. The coding scheme is provided just below the model overview and will look something like the table below.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-27.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-27.png" target="_self">
The next change is the model and product terms key tables. Just keep in mind the W coding scheme from before when interpreting each line, since now we are recognizing the separate levels of our W.
The final change is the set-up of the conditional effects table. Usually, this will either be representative of the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentile (default), or the means +/- 1 SD (if selected). However, now since we are recognizing W as a categorical variable, the doses are listed as the separate categories.
- Note how there is no mention of the percentiles in the 'Analysis Notes and Errors' section.<br>

Good fit Minimized error and strong correspondence between observed and predicted values (e.g., a large R-squared) F MSR / MSE provides overall statistical test of model fit H0 (Null Hypothesis) (x variable (s) do not predict y) With no better predictions than population mean of y H1 (Alternative Hypothesis) (x variable (s) do predict y) with better predictions than population mean of y. Mathematically accounting for the influence of another parameter on the relation between x and y.
When predictors are correlated, they potentially have shared or overlapping explained variance in Y. We need to consider the unique contribution of each.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) does NOT do this. Squaring an r statistic is only useful when there is only one predictor (R-squared)
Unique correlations are needed to account for multiple predictors: Partial (first-order) Correlation

Most common! Predicting variation in an outcome variable (y) based on changes in predictor variables (x1, x2, etc.)

Where the action is. Each row conveys information about the regression equation that SPSS produced as the 'best fitting' model.
Unstandardized coefficients are easier to interpret, but standardized coefficients are more useful for including in manuscripts (apples to apples instead of apples to oranges)
Significance level of .05 is standard, though more stringent p-values can be employed to address weaknesses in design. Zero-order correlations represent the standard correlation between each x and y
Partial and part correlations should be squared manually prior to interpretation. Squared partial correlation represents the variance remaining in y after factoring out the x variable. Squared part (semi-partial) correlation represents the unique variance explained in y by the x variable. Tolerance reflects the proportion of the variance in x that is not predictable from other x predictor variables. 0-1 with zero meaning no new contribution and one meaning completely uncorrelated with the other predictors. <br>VIF indicates the degree of similarity between an x variable and at least one other x variable in the model.

Think of dummy coding as light switches. 1 ('on') means group membership and 0 ('off') means no group membership. Dummy coding means giving every case k-1 variables that indicate group membership.
For the school variable So, someone from Cline elementary would have the following values for group membership: AEC = 0, Campbell County High = 0, Campbell County MS = 0, Campbell County Elementary = 0, Cline = 1, Crossroads = 0, Grants Lick = 0, Reiley = 0 k-1 groups are used to fully capture group membership. A 'reference' category is selected to represent group membership when all values are zero. Typically, the reference category is the most often selected category. For example, Campbell County High School has roughly 49% of the data in our sample dataset, meaning that category should be selected as the referent. Coefficients are interpreted as the mean differences between the reference category and the category in question. <br><img alt="2.

Sometime, interpreting the intercept becomes difficult or meaningless, especially when we are dealing with variables like IQ, SAT scores, etc.
We have to use what is termed as 'mean-centering' That is creating a new variable by simply subtracting the mean from each individual observation
E.g., Centered IQi = IQi - IQ-bar (mean of IQ scores) ** Centering mom_iq.
** Note that the mean for mom's IQ is 100
COMPUTE iq_c = mom_iq - 100

The scatterplot shows an inverse relationship between Mahal Distance and the associated p-values. So, if the p-value of the maximum Mahal distance (Check the 'Residual Statistics Table') is greater than the threshold of .001, you can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictor(s).
You do not even have to check the Mahal distance for individual cases. The absolute values of DfFITS (i.e., |SDF_1|) tells us the magnitude of the effect an individual case have on the predicted values. This indicates that, the SDF_1, similar to the Cook's distance, help examine the influence of some cases on the predicted values. Cases with absolute values of DfFITS greater than 2 (i.e., |SDF_1| &gt; 2) should be examined. <br><img alt="4.

Since the maximum absolute value is .33205, which is not greater than 2, we can conclude that there is no issue with an influential outlier(s). Helps examine whether a case is influential on the intercept or the slopes. The case should first be considered influential by looking at the D and/or the DfFITS. A case with an DfBeta greater than 2 can be said to have greater influence on the regression parameter in question (Pituch &amp; Stevens, 2016). This case then has to be investigated.<br>

The maximum absolute DFBETA (i.e., |DFBETA|) value for all the regression parameters (i.e., the intercept and the slopes) are less than 2, hence we can conclude that none of the cases have relatively high influence on our regression parameters. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/in-class-content/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/In-Class Content/4.

The change in the dependent (outcome) variable for a one unit change in the independent (predictor) variable, while holding all other variables constant.
Expressed in the original units of the dependent (outcome) and independent (predictor) variables. The values obtained after standardizing all variables (both dependent and independent variables) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
This allows for the newly calculated variables to represent the change in the dependent variable (in standard deviations) for one-standard deviation change in the value of the independent variable. Measures the relationship between two variables without controlling for any other variable(s) using simple correlation.
We would use this when we want to understand the simple bivariate relationship between two variables.
We would likely use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient R for this type of analysis. Measures the correlation between x and y while controlling for x2 (on both x and y).
We would likely use this when we want to understand the direct relationship between two variables, independent of influence of other variables. Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of one or more variables on only one of the two variables.

We would likely use this when we want to understand the exact contribution of an independent (predictor) variable to the dependent (outcome) variable, after taking into account the influence of other variables on the independent (predictor) variable. All predictors are added into the regression model at the same time.
The model evaluates the contribution of each predictor to the outcome variable while controlling for all other predictors.
R-squared is a static value that represents the variance explained in the outcome variable by the collective set of predictors.

Variables with non-zero values should be ‘centered’ Predictors are entered into the model in a pre-specified order based theory-driven blocks.
The model is built in blocks (steps) with each block adding one or more predictors. The change in the model’s R-squared is assessed at every step. A series of multiple-regression are performed, with each block being added to the next until all variables are included in the model.
The final block of hierarchical multiple regression = simultaneous multiple regression. Very useful to look at the change in R-squared for each variable or blocks of variables Allow for testing hypotheses in the order of importance/priority of predictors. Squared semi-partial correlation provides the unique variance explained by a given variable. Predictors are added/removed from the model based on statistical criteria such as p-values or R-squared change rather than being theory-driven. Predictors are added/removed in data-driven blocks.
Mathematically derives the highest R-squared value with the least number of predictors.
CAUTION: NEVER USE THIS METHOD UNLESS STUDY IS ABSOLUTELY EXPLORATORY. Most predictive variables are added first Least predictive variables are removed first When you square the semi-partial correlation, it yields the proportion of the variance of y uniquely explained by x while controlling for all other predictors.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK. The relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (outcome) variables is linear.
How to Check Use Scatterplots to visualize relationships. Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot.
Click Simple Scatter. Click Define.
Move your dependent variable (outcome) to the Y-Axis. Move your independent variable (predictor) to the X-Axis.
If the scatterplot is approximately linear, the assumption is met. If not linear, apply transformation. Observations are independent of each other (no autocorrelation, where observations are NOT independent)
How to Check Use the Durbin-Watson test by clicking the option under Linear Regression: Statistics.
If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 – 2.5, the assumption is met. <br>If data is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Autocorrelation" data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">autocorrelated</a>, use alternative models such as the generalized least squares (GLS) model. The residuals (errors) have constant variance across all levels of independent variable(s).
How to Check Plot residuals vs. predicted values and look for a random scatter.
In SPSS, request Linear Regression Plots. Move Y &gt; ZPRED. Move X &gt; ZRESID. If the scatterplots shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met.
If assumption is violated, you can transform the dependent variable, use standard errors, or apply weighted least squares (WLS). The residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
How to Check (For None or One Grouping Variable) Click Analyze &gt; Descriptives &gt; Explore
Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box.
Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected.
Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. Click Continue.
Click OK.
Check Shapiro-Wilk Test of Normality, Normal P-P Plot, Histogram, and Skewness/Kurtosis. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below .05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution. If the points are generally along the diagonal of the Normal P-P Plot, the assumption is met.
If the Histogram is approximately normal (distribution curve is bell-shaped), the assumption is met.
If Skewness and Kurtosis are between +2 and -2, the assumption is met. How far a case is from some point of reference <br>Identifies the distance of cases from the mean (s) of predictor (s). Extreme cases in multivariate space are found via a cut-off point (critical value of <a data-href="Chi-Square Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/chi-square-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chi-Square Test</a>) Measure the distance between an observed value and its predicted value that have all been converted to z-scores.

Typically flagged if value is over 1 Factor loadings help determine which variable is associated with which latent factor. For example, several likert-scale questions on a questionnaire observing psychological outcomes may load highly on a ‘depressive/depression’ factor, showing they measure the same underlying construct. Higher values of factor loadings (e.g., &gt; .4 or .5) indicate that a variable is a strong indicator of that factor. Lower values suggest the variable is less relevant to that factor. EFA can allow us to group variables with higher factor loadings on the same factor, reducing the complexity of our data.

The eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by each factor. If using the eigenvalue cutoff of 1, the cutoff is greater than 1 because the retained factors explain more variance. This can be seen on the Scree plot where there is a point where the slope of the curve changes, which is usually the cutoff for the number of factors we would retain. Factors to the left of the cutoff are considered meaningful. This is why there are only 3 out of the original 12 factors that were extracted from the analysis. The first three factors account for more of the variance in the model.

On request
Commercial datasets (unless you have access through a library, department, funding) Publicly available (i.e., de-identified)
Restricted access (i.e., request to use)
Unshareable (i.e., no sharing possible) All verifiable/reusable data possibly through anonymization
Aggregated/summarized/redacted version of the data
Publicly share some parts and restrict access to others
Restrict access, but share details of data held
Share only details about study, no sharing possible Many datasets have both public and restricted files.
Restricted data contains more data and a wider range of data values than are included in public use data. For most, the public-use files provide all the data they will need for most analyses, though some users may find that only the restricted files have the specific data they need. If you are not sure, first examine the public-use data. Outliers (unusually high or unusually low values) are top- or bottom-coded to prevent identification of unique schools, teachers, parents, and children without affecting overall data quality. <br>Some <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> variables are converted into categorical variables, and some categorical variables have their categories collapsed. <br>Category value labels are provided for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> variables that are converted into categorical variables. Variables with too few cases and/or a sparse distribution are suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2 and labelled 'suppressed' in the Electronic Codebook (ECB). The value -2 means that the data for this variable are suppressed to protect the respondent's confidentiality. Variables that provide a particularly identifying characteristic, such as a specific disability, or information that could be matched against external data sources to obtain a specific identifying characteristic, such as exact date of marriage or divorce, are also suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2. Will vary for different data, but for all, you will need to complete an application. Submit signed license document Primary researcher
Senior official at institution Submit signed and notarized affidavits of nondisclosure for all proposed users. Submit a signed security plan (must specify the exact locked location) where the data will be secured. You cannot transmit restricted-use data.
Maintain a data license file and ensure that all authorized users follow the agreed upon terms. Participate in unannounced security inspections to ensure compliance. Adhere to established publication rules. Submit all materials for disclosure review. Complete annual trainings online. Complete yearly reports of what work you have done. Start with a broad question. Think about who might collect that data (e.g., governments, other researchers, etc.) Want to stick close to a specific subfield or type of data? Look for recognized repositories in your field, large research projects, or publications that have data access statements. Likely need to combine several search strategies. Remember Some disciplines have more of a tradition of sharing

Searching by variable name is helpful when you are interested in a particular variable (e.g., spanking). Often, studies are organized into collections in each archive so a researcher can quickly identify groups of studies focused on a particular subarea. The organization of each archive varies, but most share several major features. Most archives allow you to perform basic descriptive analyses before the downloading a dataset. This is great because you can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in repsonses, for your purposes. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications.

Study usage reports Subject Matter Consider whether the subject is consistent with your problem definition and whether the data apply to the time/population of interest Methods Consider whether the data can be used with your preferred method of analysis or if you'll need ot learn a new skill. Measurement Determine whether the data capture the measures and constructs you are interested in with sufficient/adequate detail. Time You will save time on data collection and get access to larger scale data, but may spend more time on cleaning, modifying, getting documentation, etc. License/Copyright Is the data licensed? Does it restrict usage? Terms of Use Are the terms you need to meet to gain access to the data or other restrictions? Citations You will want to formally cite the data you use; data sets should have a persistent identifier to help cite the data, such as DOI. Documentation Look for good documentation on how the data was collected, for what purpose, how it was transformed. Credibility Is the data from a recognized lab, researcher, institution? Do the publications based on the data hold? Does the dataset contain the information you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?
Do the measures used match those you require?
Is the data set a proxy for the data you really need?
Does the dataset cover the population that is the subject of your research?
Does the dataset cover the geographical area that is the subject of your research?
Can data about the population that is the subject of your research be separated from unwanted data?
Are the data for the right time period or sufficiently up to date?
Are data available for all the variables you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?
Are the variables defined clearly? How reliable is the dataset?
How credible is the data source?
Is it clear what the source of the data is?
Do the credentials of the source of the data (author, institution, or organization sponsoring the data) suggest it is likely to be reliable?
Do the data have an associated copyright statement?
Do associated published documents exist?
Does the source contain contact details for obtaining further information about the data?
Is the method described clearly?
If sampling was used, what was the procedure and what were the associated sampling errors and response rates?
Who was responsible for collecting or recording the data?
(For surveys) Is a copy of the questionnaire or interview checklist included?
(For compiled data) Are you clear how the data were analyzed and compiled?
Are the data likely to contain measurement bias?
What was the original purpose for which the data were collected?
Who was the target The most important step is to read ALL the data documentation. Before assessing data, review codebooks and questionnaires What information was collected
For whom and when and where
What changes were made before archiving Codebooks also include other information (e.g., topics addressed, questions and measurements used, frequency of responses or values, how to use the data, etc.)
Like a regular book, some codebooks are better than others. If people code the variable in a certain way, is there potential for error? Would two researchers get the same outcomes if they chose to code the variable differently?

You do not need to install any package before using those functions
However, to access a function written by others (other than the original 'authors' of R), you first have to install it as a 'package.'
These packages often come with dataset(s), functions, examples, etc.
Install a package using 'install.Packages ('name of the package)')'
You need to install the package once and it will be on your computer permanently. After installing a package, you need to load it before having access to its functions, datasets, etc.

A simple scatterplot (with a regression line) showing the relationship between the covariate and the outcome variable can help verify this assumption. You can run the ANCOVA model by including an interaction term (groups x covariate). The interaction term should not be statistically significant. If it is statistically significant, then it means the slopes are different across groups, hence the violation of this assumption. UNIANOVA Dependent Variable BY Factor WITH Covar

The order matters! Each effects partials out the one before it. So, if you are looking at a, b, and a x b The first value is for a
The value for b is after controlling for a
a x b's value is after controlling for a and b. Best for specific theory where order matters I.e., partial out certain variables first. a accounts for b and vice versa. This is best when you don't have an interaction effect. Every value accounts for every other effect (main or interaction) If order matters, Type I. If order does not matter, and there is no interaction, Type II. If order does not matter, but there is an interaction, Type III. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/in-class-content/6.-analysis-of-covariance-(ancova).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/In-Class Content/6.

A moderator is a variable that affects the strength or direction of the relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y).
A mediator is a variable that explains the mechanisms or process through which an independent variable (x) affects a dependent variable (y). The purpose of the ‘seed’ option in a line of PROCESS syntax is to lock the random number generator. This ensures that the findings remain consistent across multiple runs of the analysis. Without specifying a ‘seed’ value, the random number generator would draw different values each time, leading to slightly different results. When a covariable absorbs variable from both the predictor and the error term, it can lead to: Sphericity is an assumption in repeated measures ANOVA that states the variance of the differences between all pairs of within-subject conditions (levels of the independent variable) should be equal. This means that if we have three time points (A, B, C), then the variance of (A – B) ≈ variance of (A – C) ≈ variance of (B – C).
Sphericity is a special case of homogeneity of variance assumption and is specific to repeated measures designs.
Potential Consequences of Violating Sphericity Inflated <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> Rate (False Positives) Standard F-tests assume sphericity, so violating it increases the risk of finding a significant effect when none actually exists.
The p-values become too small, leading to incorrect conclusions. Reduced Statistical Power (False Negative) If sphericity is violated and not corrected, the test might be too conservative, making it harder to detect real effects (Type II Error: Failing to detect a true effect). Distorted F-ratios The denominator degrees of freedom in the F-test get inflated which makes the ANOVA test statistics biased. This impacts the accuracy of hypothesis testing. Long-Format Data

Repeated measures designs are an extension of the dependent group (paired samples) t-test.
Paired samples t-tests are used to compare means between paired, dependent, or matched groups. Collection of data on the same persons over time means responses are related to each other, across time. They are <a data-href="Dependent Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Observations</a> Differences from pre to post (e.g., time 1 to time 2)
Often the same respondents, repeatedly measured (not always, but not our focus) In comparison, independent-groups designs look at: Differences in means across groups (often manipulated in experimental designs)
Mean differences across existing groups Gender, school level, generation status (e.g., quasi-experimental designs) With repeated measures designs, the structure of the data becomes relevant. Data types Long Respondents have multiple rows of data corresponding to multiple measurement occasions Wide Respondents have one row of data
Multiple variables are used to represent multiple measurement occasions GLM for repeated measures (aka repeated measures ANOVA/MANOVA) Combination of both between-and within-subjects factors are referred to as 'mixed designs' Different people are assigned to different levels of the factor
Each case (person) is exposed/included to only one condition or level The same person tests all conditions (i.e., is exposed to all levels of the factor)
Repeated-measures designs are 'within-subjects' designs, where each subject forms a 'group' or factor Repeated measures ANOVA SST = SS (Explained) + SS (unexplained) We are trying to explain differences in teh repeated measures due to time (or whatever the within factor is)
We are removing/controlling variability due specifically to subjects. We need to characterize unexplained/residual variability carefully for repeated measures designs (i.e., through the subject x time interaction)
One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA One-Way Repeated measures ANOVA with A treatments/times and B persons includes three 'sum of squares' terms. <br><img alt="7.

Relatedly, homogeneity of covariance is equal variances and covariacnes across time. Sphericity is a tough assumption to meet, as we don't expect correlations between times 1, 3, and 5 to be necessarily the same. Mauchly's sphericity test in SPSS tests this assumption. We do NOT want this to be statistically significant. The distribution of the data will not be in line with an F-distribution
Loss of statistical power
Post-hoc tests become uninterpretable
If violated, what should we do? Use a more conservative f-test. SPSS gives you three options increasing in conservatism
Consider using MANOVA
Consider using multilevel modeling Based on estimates of sphericity (Epsilon; ε) Ranges from 0 - 1 with higher scores meaning greater homogeneity Huynh-Feldt Correction (least conservative) ε &gt; .75
Greenhouse-Geisser (more conservative) ε &lt; .75
Lower-bound (most conservative) ε &lt;. 75
If the results change depending on which correction used, it's a safer bet to use Greenhouse-Geisser regardless of Epsilon value (e.g., the cutoff somehow made a difference) or report both and acknowledge the difference. <br>Instead of time as treatment effect (univariate), MANOVA treats time as separate <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> s (multivariate)
Repeated measures analyses automatically include both, but if sphericity is violated, it might be better to just use MANOVA. Repeated Measures ANOVA Univariate DV
More rigid assumptions of sphericity
When sphericity holds, use RM ANOVA
You can look at contrasts and other post-hoc tests MANOVA Multivariate DVs
Less rigid assumptions of sphericity
A large violation of sphericity (ε &lt; .70) and sample sizes of 10 people larger than the number of groups (j + 1), use MANOVA. The power of MANOVA varies as a function of the correlation between the DVs. <br>Multilevel modeling approach (aka <a data-href="Hierarchical Linear Models" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/models/hierarchical-linear-models.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Linear Models</a>; General Linear Mixed-Effects Models)
Growth curve models Predicts individual differences in change over time Time is nested within each subject
Very flexible Allows for random effects and variability in measurement occasion. If the overall F for differences among treatments is statistically significant, further analysis is needed to evaluate where the significant differences are. The SPSS procedure contrasts that can be used to evaluate differences. If the repeated measure has k levels, a set of contrasts include (k - 1) comparisons
Options Polynomial contrasts (the default in SPSS, but rarely used in social sciences)
Repeated contrasts
Simple contrasts For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them. <br>Very similar to dummy coding in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a>, where we only know differences between the reference category and all other categories (not each other) Compare the mean of each level (except the last) with the mean of the subsequent level Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 2 &gt; Time 3 Useful if the responses are in a meaningful order (like time)
Equivalence (or justifiable inequivalence) of measurement is crucial Makes more sense when the levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to different amounts of treatment (rather than different types)
If there are k levels for the repeated-measures factor, then (k - 1) polynomials will be tested. Example
- Patients' responses to an anxiety drug administered over time

Select your ID variable and put it as the case group identification. You could also 'use case number' and have the ID variable be a fixed variable, but I find that more troublesome. You then have to include all items to be stacked in separate blocks based on what the variable will be. You must do this for every variable to be stacked. The dataset has 129 such variables, so you can see that this will take a long time. Most of the time, stacked data comes stacked so you don't need to do this. “7.

<br>We reject our <a data-href="Null Hypothesis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/null-hypothesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Null Hypothesis</a>, F (4,28) = 9.435, p &lt; .001. There is significant difference in the mean fear of snakes during the different treatment times. Partial η2 = .574, indicating 57.4% of the variation in the scores is accounted for by the differences in the scores. When constructing our table, we have the Between Groups Line (the line for the test that we use for our final result).
We also have the Within Groups (error) line (the associated error line for whichever test we use).
But what about the between persons results and the total line? Below is the Test of Between Subjects Effects
We use the error line here to construct the Between Persons line “7. Repeated Measures Designs-14.png” could not be found. As for your Total Line, we just add Extension to the dependent t-test
Same individuals measured two or more times
Sometimes called a Within-Subjects Design
In a one-way repeated measures model, each subject responds to each level of the factor
In a balanced design Each subject responds to all J levels of the factor
Each of the n subjects has J scores do N = n x J
Unequal cells can only happen when subjects miss the administration of one or more levels of factor A A researcher tested whether 1-hour, biweekly yoga classes increased the fitness level of eight undergraduate studnets over a 4-month period (4 levels of within-subjects factors). Students were measured at the end of each month using a 10-point fitness measure (10 being most fit). “7. Repeated Measures Designs-10.png” could not be found.

The test scores were compared over time. Thus, we have 3 levels in the within-subjects factor (Time). For each pair of levels, we can obtain a st of difference scores. The sphericity assumption states that these three sets of difference scores have equal variance. If the variance of the difference scores are statistically equal then the sphericity assumption has been met. The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA
The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA. <br>The violation causes the 'Usual' F-test to become too liberal (i.e., an increase in the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate). Therefore, determining whether sphericity has been violated is very important. <br>Luckily, if violations of sphericity do occur, corrections have been developed to produce a more valid critical F-value (i.e., reduce the increase in <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate) Like in Levene's HOV test, the null hypothesis is the variances of difference scores are equal.
Test NOT Significant (p &gt; .05) &gt; Assumption MET! Variances are the same. Test Significant (p &lt; .05) &gt; Assumption NOT met! Variances are different. Measure: Score - Tests the null hypothesis that the error covariance matrix of the orthonormalized transformed dependent variables is proportional to an identity matrix: a Design: Intercept. Within Subjects Design: CAP. Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicates that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, , χ2 (2) = 7.916, p = .019.

For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them.

Family Influences]]></title><description><![CDATA[I. OverviewThis document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:
The impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.
Parental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.
The interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.
The importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.
II. Key Themes and FindingsA. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)
Core Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.
Key Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.
"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
Secrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.
Increased secrecy is linked to "stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret."
Implications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.
B. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)
Core Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).
Key Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (ρ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).
Psychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.
Parental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
Cultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.
Implications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.
C. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)
Core Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.
Key Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms
Greater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.
"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
Racial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety
Implications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.
D. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)
Core Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.
Key Findings:"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
LGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.
Latino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents
Implications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.
III. Quotes
Frijns et al. (2010): "Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
Liu et al. (2020): "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
Montoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): "Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
Ryan et al. (2010): "Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
IV. Overall ImplicationsThese studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on strengthening family bonds, addressing both cultural and economic stressors, and promoting positive family dynamics to support healthy adolescent development.]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/7.-family-influences.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/7.

In this week's spotlight for attractions, we have Ohio History Connection (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" target="_self">https://www.ohiohistory.org/Links to an external site.</a>)!&nbsp;The Ohio History Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society, is a statewide history organization with the mission to spark discovery of Ohio’s stories. As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state’s history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;<br>For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://mozartscafe.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://mozartscafe.com/" target="_self">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart’s brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This "taste of Austria" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most "brilliantly illuminated city in the country." Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days. The leaves are falling! Where does the time go.&nbsp;Have a wonderful week, and please reach out to myself or Anna, our TA, if you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerAnother week, another (late) announcement,I hope you are having a great week, we are halfway through, whether that's the semester or the week you decide! This week we will begin to look at the basic patterns of sexual orientation and behavior. We also look at the critiques on sexual attitudes, sex education, and the sexual double standard. By the end of this module, you will be able to answer some questions such as...
What is sexual orientation? How have attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the medical and scientific communities?
According to researchers, what is the role of genetics, evolution, and social environment in determining sexual orientation?
REMINDER: Please put aside enough time to watch 'How to Lose Your Virginity' (1 hour and 6 minutes) and 'Sex 101' (20 min).&nbsp;<br>In this week's restaurant, I chose Belle's Bread.&nbsp;Tucked away in the Japanese marketplace located on Kenny Centre Mall,&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" target="_self">Belle’s BreadLinks to an external site.</a>&nbsp;is a family-owned and -operated, French-inspired Japanese bakery. Takashi Takenaka opened the business after immigrating from Japan in 1972, and he pays homage to childhood treats with his red bean roll, frank roll, and curry and boiled egg doughnuts. The bear-shaped strawberry cream bun is all over social media, but the best-kept secret is the Mont Blanc roll with its layers of delicate, airy sweet cream and chestnuts.&nbsp;<br>In Columbus Lore this week, our amazing student Doug Motz wrote this piece on the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" title="Link" href="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" target="_self">AIU &amp; The LeVeque TowerLinks to an external site.</a>. I learned so much information from this article, and it is just one piece of history from our city. Please take a moment to read through this article, if you get the chance. You know that big building that has those beautiful lights displayed at the top? Yup, that's this place! It has gone through it's fair share of history, and many owners. Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!! Just a wonderful piece of history to share with you all.&nbsp;Go outside and play in the leaves, take a moment to breathe. You have done so well, and I am so proud of you! Keep working hard as you always have, and remember to take care of yourself this week. :)Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerGoooooooood Evening Buckeyes!

On this week's Columbus lore, I thought I would bring it a little closer to home and look into OSU's history. You know that beautiful building you most likely walk by regularly called University Hall? Well, do I have some interesting facts for you.This was the first classroom building opened in 1873!&nbsp;<br>

On the first day of classes in September 1873, the students entered an unfinished University Hall. This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.<br>In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today’s University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today’s University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/" target="_self">https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/Links to an external site.</a>)For a random Columbus restaurant, I wanted something close to campus. I chose Emmett's Cafe! This bakery/cafe is located in the Old North.&nbsp;Inspired by Australian coffee culture, Emmett’s is the top pick for morning hangouts with a flat white or cold brew. This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks. Get that pumpkin spice latte for yourself, you deserve that treat! I can't wait to see the leaves falling all over campus.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn Ash (Lynn Reidinger)Hey Class,I apologize for missing our weekly announcement last week, but I was unfortunately not feeling well. We can't skip this week, what if some of you are waiting on this week's Columbus lore? As always, I will have interesting history, activities, and suggested restaurants below.You worked through your midterm, WOO! I am so proud of each of you for getting to this point in the semester. I can't believe we are almost finished. It has been a pleasure getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to each of you that congratulated me on my marriage, and this week seems very fitting!This week we look at marriage and cohabitation. Be mindful as we reflect on diversity, inequality, and social change in terms of marriage. We will consider how marital quality changes across the life course and illustrate the hallmarks of poor marital communication. Do you know what are the predictors of a high quality, satisfying marriage? What specific relationships come to mind when you think of a healthy marriage?This week's assignments are outlined below. As always, we accept your assignments 24-hours late with a 2-point deduction on your essays and discussions, and a 1-point deduction for your weekly reflections. We are unable to accept your InQuizitive quizzes late.&nbsp;Please read:

Originally, there was no formal plan for an Oval. The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps “The Five Brothers,” which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" target="_self">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!<br><img alt="Announcements-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png" target="_self">
Anthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony’s dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony’s son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony’s Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father. Realizing&nbsp;the quality of the candy was creating a demand, Tom and his father decided to make it a full time trade, and using their first names they formed the Anthony-Thomas Candy Company in 1952.Astounding Activities: The Scioto Deer&nbsp;“Announcements-8.png” could not be found.You may have probably seen at least one of the three bronze deer sculptures located throughout Columbus, but do you know why they’re actually there? It’s okay, neither did I. These friendly, relaxed-looking deer were added to the Scioto Mile as part of the big rehabilitation project in 2014 that&nbsp;turned the area into the incredible multi-use park and trail space it is now.There are a total of three deer along the Scioto River admiring the river, and they were put in during the renovation. Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don’t worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;I hope you all have a great week. I should be on tomorrow for our office hours if you may need anything (My office hours are Tuesdays from 1p-2p). Please take some time this week to soak in some sun and enjoy this fall weather. You have worked so hard to get to this point!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshIT'S HALLOWEEN!!!This is my favorite holiday, and it makes me so happy to see people dressed up while walking around campus. Make sure to grab some candy for yourself (... getting it on sale tomorrow does in fact count), and take it easy this week. This week's topic some of you may already have some experience with, whether directly or indirectly, parenting. We will analyze societal expectations and attitudes around parenthood and childlessness. We will also look at concepts of intensive motherhood, helicopter parenting, and co-parenting.&nbsp;REMINDERS:InQuizitive (Chapter 9): 11/1Discussion (Intensive Parenting): 11/3Essay 9: 11/5Reflection 9: 11/5<br>On this week's Columbus lore, we are back on campus with my personal favorite:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" target="_self">Mirror Lake</a><br>

It is very fitting to choose this wonderful place as our topic for Columbus Lore. The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!“Announcements-9.png” could not be found.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" target="_self">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a>On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn’s products.Astounding Activities:&nbsp;“Announcements-10.png” could not be found.<br>For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" target="_self">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape.

Mr. Ted has been coming to campus with me, so if you ever see us walking by don't be afraid to say hi!Have a fantastic week!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHi Buckeyes!Though we are not covering anything this week, I wanted to send an announcement out to all of you regarding the event that will take place for each of you tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHappy Tuesday everyone!Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life. We discuss examples of implicit bias and microaggressions and how they impact the individual and family.&nbsp;<br>We will be reading Chapter 3 in Cohen (2020) this week, which is posted under the top module labelled '<a title="Textbook Information" class="internal-link" data-href="/courses/180658/modules/1814602" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Textbook Information</a>.' You will also be taking a look at a few videos on racism and microaggressions.&nbsp;Things to keep in mind for this week:

Title: A qualitative examination of familial racial-ethnic socialization experiences among multiracial American emerging adults., Author: Atkin, Annabelle L.; Jackson, Kelly F.; White, Rebecca M. B.; Tran, Alisia G. T. T.; Journal: Journal of Family Psychology, Volume: 36,
Issue: 2
Pages: 179-190
Year: 2022 DOI: 10.1037/fam0000918
ISSN: 1939-1293, 0893-3200
This qualitative interview study investigated the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages received by Multiracial American youth over the course of their development. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.

Virginia case. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18. There is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families. Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict. <br><a data-href="Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)</a> <br><a data-href="Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation</a> Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.
This model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development. Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.
MultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status. Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth: Cultural Socialization Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. Racial Identity Socialization Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves. Preparation for Bias Messages Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. Egalitarian Socialization Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same Negative Socialization Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial Exposure to Diversity Messages Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. No Racial-Ethnic Socialization Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews Racial Identity Socialization
Preparation for Bias Socialization
Colorblind Socialization
Diversity Appreciation Socialization
Race-Conscious Socialization
Exposure to Diversity Socialization
Negative Socialization
Silent Socialization Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture. Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures. Language Socialization There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group. Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned. "You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such." Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them. Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.
One way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@atkinqualitativeexaminationfamilial2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

The biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence stimulate young people to think about themselves, reﬂect on the kind of people they want to become, and ﬁnd their place in society. Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson’s theory and Marcia’s identity status model, but process-oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents ﬁnd a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well-being.

Teaching and talking about race and ethnicity with children and adults is especially important in racially diverse societies. This process has been coined racial/ethnic socialization (RES). Despite the importance of RES, we still know very little about how this process unfolds in the lives of White youth. Thus, from a social, cognitive, and developmental perspective, the authors summarize ﬁndings from empirical research and theory on RES for White youth across stages of development—early childhood through young adulthood. Since RES is linked with cross-group attitudes (e.g., less bias, prejudice, stereotyping) and behaviors (e.g., inclusion), we highlight future directions for research and discuss applications for existing ﬁndings for an increasingly diverse society.

Abstract
In the current decade, the U.S. population reached historically high levels of ethnic–racial diversity and reelected the nation's first Black–White biracial President. Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic–racial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‐seated ethnic–racial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic–racial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic–racial socialization in this decade. Furthermore, although it is clear that family ethnic–racial socialization is a robust predictor of youths' adjustment, the associations between socialization and adjustment must be considered with attention to specific socialization strategies, the confluence of strategies used, and the unique contexts within which families' lives are embedded.

Cultural-­ecological theories posit that ethnic-r­ acial identity (ERI) development is shaped by transactions between contexts of ethnic-­racial socialization, yet research considering intersections among multiple contexts is limited. In this study, Black, Latino, White, and Asian American adolescents (N = 98; Mage = 16.26, SD = 1.09; 55.1% female identifying) participated in surveys and focus group discussions (2013–­2014) to share insights into ERI development in context. Using consensual qualitative research, results indicated: (a) family ethnic-­racial socialization intersects with community-­based, peer, media, and school socialization; (b) ethnic-­ racial socialization occurs outside family through intersections between peer, school, community-­based, and media settings; and (c) ethnic-r­ acial socialization is embedded within systems of racial oppression across contexts. Discussion includes implications for future research and interventions supporting youth ERI.

Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood that begins around the onset of puberty and ends with relative independence from the parent. This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.

The dual-system based largely on Metcalf &amp; Mischel's (1999) two-system model of willpower. According to the model, self-control results from a balance between a 'cool' and a 'hot' system. The cool system is an emotionally neutral, strategic, and flexible cognitive system. The hot system is emotionally driven by fears, desires, and reflexes. The balance between these two system varies as a function of the individual, development, and stress. The dual-system model was used to heuristically explain brain systems underlying behavior involving immediate versus delayed rewards.

A research question is a statement that identifies the phenomenon to be studied. For example, "Does preschool influence children's language skills?" Why are good research questions important and what makes them 'good?' Purpose
Relevance
Feasibility To produce a research question, you need to know the literature first. Find out what has been done and how you can contribute to the existing literature. I have a research question. If you do not have a research question, narrow down your topic. Review the literature
Is the question viable, original. feasible?
You have a research question! Narrow down on an area of interest
Within that area, try to answer a question that: Has either not been addressed before
Has been addressed before but that you could extend (i.e., new data-set, different approach, etc.)
Has been addressed but requires replication
Starts a new research area (NOT recommended) Read as much as you can on the topic
Read recent studies first, then read backwards
Read all relevant papers (or at least the influential ones)
Ideas on the research topic often come from reading
The more you read, the easier it will be to come up with research questions Reviewing the literature will allow you to understand whether your question has been answered/is valid.
By reading previous studies, you might get ideas on how to tweak your original research question into a new one. Whether you have or do not have a research question, it is crucial that you review the literature in the area first. Many leave the review as the last step, but this is dangerous. Not original
Not feasible Time constraint (e.g., not enough time)
Resources (e.g., lack of data)
Knowledge (e.g., do I know method X?) Too broadly defined research question
Not well justified
Not motivated by literature Start searching for a topic as early as possible
Once you narrow down a topic/area, look at the relevant literature (i.e., a literature review)
Once you have done the literature review (has it already been done? No, why not? Is it interesting/relevant?), then ask yourself: Is the question specific (not too broad)?
Is it feasible in the allotted time?
Do I have enough resources (data) to answer this question?
How about knowledge (methods)?
Is the research question falling within my area of research?
If the answer is yes to all the previous question, congratulations, you have a research question. Your time is your most important resource. Do not take a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances) Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic/data set
More efficient time use (e.g., read similar lit)
Looks good when others are evaluating your CV A good research question will Allow outsiders to see your intentions
Help you develop hypotheses (not always)
Contributes to existing knowledge Contribution does not have to be huge
Replication is a contribution
Filling a gap is not enough justification, why does this gap matter? Guide the design of your methods
Allow the target population to be identified
Identify the outcome variables and key predictors of those variables
Determine what type of study is needed (e.g., descriptive, correlational, experimental)
Identify background characteristics that might influence predictors and outcomes
Raise questions about how to best collect data
Influence the number of participants in the study Writing a good question is an iterative process What do you want to learn about?
Draft and redraft with increasing specificity using the guidelines listed above. Ask for feedback from colleagues (science is a collective effort).
Build on the work of others by conducting a systematic literature review. This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. Hook the reader in. Practice! Explain the larger context that this study will inform. Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. Flows directly from the earlier points in paragraph 1. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. State the basic aims, hypotheses, questions, and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths) Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph - could be theoretically, in terms of policy, filling holes, etc. Can be combined with paragraph 2 in some cases.

Some measures were assessments over a five years. Some measures were common to each annual assessment, whereas others common to each annual assessment, whereas others were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote an article regarding the relation between divorce history an article regarding the relation between divorce history and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital satisfaction from those who did not experience the satisfaction from those who did not experience the transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The researcher decided to publish these as three separate researcher decided to publish these as three separate articles. Not Piecemeal Researcher B was interested in the relation between family process and adolescent adjustment. She conducted and published a study in which the main conducted and published a study in which the main objective was to identify specific family processes that objective was to identify specific family processes that mediated the relation between family structure and mediated the relation between family structure and adjustment. Later, she read a new study that proposed that two of the family processes that she studied had an interactive effect on adjustment. Although such an interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, in additional analyses she found that such an effect did occur in her sample, although in a slightly different than in the newly published article. She wrote a second article to address this issue. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the extent to which support for marriage from family and friends affects rating of relationship quality. He collected data from a large convenience sample. Although not planned, the sample contained about 60% of persons in their first marriages and 40% of persons in remarriages. The researcher prepared two papers that examined the question of interest. In the first paper, he used data from the first-marriage subjects, whereas in the second paper he used data from the remarried subjects. The variables assessed and reported in the two papers were the same. Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the links between family structure and child adjustment. The researcher administered a survey to high school students. She discovered that there were large numbers in two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families, but very few students were in the single divorced father and stepmother families as part of the survey, students in stepfamilies answered survey items regarding the parenting behaviors of their stepparents as well as of their parents. She wrote two papers. The first examined differences in adjustment in children from two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families (the groups with the largest sample sizes). To facilitate the interpretation of family structure effects, she decided to exclude the rather small number of students in the second paper, she explored whether children's adjustment was related to how they rated the parenting behaviors of their parents and stepparents. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in rates of divorce in first-marriages and remarriages in different countries. She obtained data from an international organization that contained information on a number of different countries and wrote two papers. The first addressed the divorce rates in these two kinds of couples in Canada, and the second dealt with the same issue in England. The same theoretical rationale and measures were used in both papers, although the results led to different conclusions. Piecemeal Focus on quality and not quantity of publications Replicate the study with a different sample, setting, or methodology. Do this if most of the past research you have read examines one type of sample, setting, or method. Examine the topic using a different design. If the study was a quasi- or non-experimental, conduct an experiment. Do this if causation has not been consistently established by past research, or it has not been consistently established with the population you are interested in. Examine how another variable might impact results Do this if you have research evidence to suggest that results may depend on another variable. Conduct a similar study with a different outcome or dependent variable. Do this if you find research evidence supporting the new associations you plan to examine. Being first is not always a sign of being a good scientist Many discoveries are wrong or over claimed. You do not show you are a great scientist by being the first to claim something. A large part of getting over being scooped is getting over yourself and realizing that science is bigger than any one of us. It also means you are doing something other people care about. If you are scooped, do not be discouraged. It is unlikely that any two researchers would address a question in the exact same way. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

ISSN: 1477-9137, 0021-9533 Keywords: Read Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Henry Taube (who won the Novel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I did not know was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right answer or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. We don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid - that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity.' that kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, ‘I don’t know’. The point of the exam isn’t to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it’s the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student’s weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student’s knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@schwartzimportancestupidityscientific2008.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Title: The Art of Data Science, Author: Peng, Roger D; Matsui, Elizabeth; Year: 2018 Keywords: In Progress The thinking begins before you even look at a dataset, and it's well worth devoting careful thought to your question. This point cannot be over-emphasized as many of the 'fatal' pitfalls of data analysis can be avoided by expending the mental energy to get your question right. There are six basic types of questions. Descriptive
Exploratory
Inferential
Predictive
Causal
Mechanistic Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. The type of question you are asking directly informs how you interpret your results. A descriptive question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. There is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the set of data that you are working with. An exploratory question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. These types of analyses are also called 'hypothesis-generating' analyses because rather than testing a hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question, you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. An inferential question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data. A predictive question would be one where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal. In other instances, even if your data are not from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer a causal question. A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a mechanistic question. By necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions. If a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering the inferential question. The type of question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis).
If this type of data set does not exist, then the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illness. Establish your expectations about the question
Gathering information about your question
Determining if your expectations match the information you gathered, and then refining your question (or expectations) if your expectations did not match the information you gathered. There are five key characteristics of a good question for a data analysis, which range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already been answered to the more abstract characteristic that each of the possible answers to the question should have a single interpretation and be meaningful. The question should be of interest to your audience, the identity of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with data.
You should also check that the question has not already been answered. With the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon to discover that your question of interest has been answered already.
The question should also stem from a plausible framework. If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end up with an answer that's difficult to interpret or have confidence in. Many questions are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible framework. The question, should also, of course, be answerable.
Specificity is also an important characteristic of a good question. Working towards specificity will refine your question and directly inform what steps to take when you start looking at data.
With this degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will either recommend or not recommend the specific action. Another aspect to consider when you’re developing your question is what will happen when you translate it into a data problem. Every question must be operationalized as a data analysis that leads to a result. Pausing to think through what the results of the data analysis would look like and how they might be interpreted is important as it can prevent you from wasting a lot of time embarking on an analysis whose result is not interpretable. The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question that uses inappropriate data. The problem with this question is that for a single possible answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations arises when at least one of the variables you use is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after. To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required to answer your question. A related problem that intergeres with interpretation of results is confounding. Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship between factors. A brief description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both your exposure of interest and your outcome of interest. As you refine your question, spend time identifying the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information about these potential confounders. Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a biased result. The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics above what exists in the general population. A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors, bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person might recall the past when responding to a survey. The best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the question with the data available to you. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@pengartdatascience2018.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Secondary data analysis of large longitudinal and national data sets is a standard method used in many social sciences to answer complex questions regarding behavior. In this article, we detail the advantages of using these data sets to study developmental questions across the life span. First, we provide an overview of how using secondary data can increase studies’ scientiﬁc integrity. Then, we detail where and how data sets can be obtained that answer speciﬁc questions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues related to using longitudinal, population data sets. These data sets can enhance science and test theories by increasing the rigor and generalizability of research to the general population, making secondary data analysis an important method to consider.
Keywords: Need to Read Primary data are collected by an individual or a team of researchers and are often based on the theory or models of the researcher or research team. These data are also generally proprietary and not shared with the larger research community. In contrast, secondary data analysis uses data collected by other researchers or organizations, and the users are generally not part of the design of the study. These data sets (e.g., most national studies) have been collected for the use of the research community or have been made available for other researchers to use (e.g., in data archives). These data sets were collected based on the research theories and models of the primary researchers and include extensive measurements on the areas of interest to the research team. Although some data sets remain proprietary to the original researcher or research team, new regulations on data sharing from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are increasing the amount of data available for secondary data analysis. Many secondary data sets contain similarities in measurement that allow many data sets to be combined using techniques such as integrative data analysis, a technique that is especially useful for data sets that represent highly selective groups (e.g., children of alcoholics) that would be difficult to find in a general population sample. Combining the data sets increases the sample size and thus the power to examine these groups. Using secondary data sets, especially those collected at the population level, increases statistical power and external validity as a result of a larger sample size and greater diversity of respondents (with regard to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). This advantage, combined with reducing the time and money it takes to collect one's own longitudinal data, makes secondary data analysis a good option.
These data resources are easy to obtain. In the US, the two largest social science data archives are the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Murray Research Archive.<br>
<img alt="Social Science Secondary Data Archives Table.jpeg" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/social-science-secondary-data-archives-table.jpeg" target="_self">
ICPSR requires affiliation with a member institution. Some data sets are available for immediate download while others require an application explaining the scientific purpose for data use. Data are generally free though fees may apply for digitization of not-yet digital materials or other labor-intensive data-preparation tasks. Archives are easily searchable, including the ability to search by study topic or variable name. Searching by study topic is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching by variable name is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching for variable name is helpful when the researcher is interested in a particular variable, such as rates of endorsement or forms of measurement of a variable across studies. Most archives allow researchers to perform basic descriptive analyses online before downloading a data set, including frequency counts for each variable and tabular analysis. Scientists can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in responses, or not too much missing data for the new study. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. The most important step is to read all the data documentation - text documents posted in the data archive alongside the data. Understanding and properly accounting for the sampling frame and necessary weights are crucial in producing accurate results, and the study documentation contains the necessary information. Secondary data rarely have all the measures to answer investigators' questions. Using data that have been collected by others typically means that measures for some of the constructs germane to the research question will be missing. Because population data sets typically measure a broad set of constructs with limited measurement on any given construct, they often are not ideal for answering nuanced questions that require in-depth measurement. Once a researcher has addressed the issue of obtaining the data set or sets to address his or her research questions and whether they adequately answer the relevant research questions, additional statistical issues must be considered in analyzing this data. Because oversampling of one or more subpopulations is common in population-based studies, researchers often must apply a same weight if they want their findings to generalize to the target population. Subpopulations that are underrepresented in the sample relative to the target population have sample weights larger than 1.0, while the opposite holds for subpopulations overrepresented in the sample relative to the target population. When no sample weights are applied, it is as if a sample weight of 1.0 is uniformly applied to all subpopulations. In effect, this assumes all subpopulations are represented accurately within the sample, leading to biased estimates when this assumption does not hold. Typically, the appropriate set of sample weights and its corresponding variable name are identified clearly within a data set's documentation files. <br>In contrast to sample weights, which adjust for <a data-href="Sampling Bias" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/sampling-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sampling Bias</a>, attrition weights correct for bias introduced by attrition. The objective of attrition weights is to render the Wave 2 sample comparable to the full Wave 1 sample. Mathematically, attrition weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition or dropping out: P (Wave 1) / (Wave 2) Combination weights (also called longitudinal weights) adjust for both sampling bias and attrition bias. Mathematically, combination weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., the sample weight) multiplied by the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition (i.e., the attrition weight): [P (target population) / P (sample)] x [P (Wave 1) / P (Wave 2)].
We suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights (either alone or as a part of combination weights) and instead of using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), or multiple imputation (MI) to adjust for attrition bias and then use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias. We make this recommendation because relative to FIML and MI, attrition weights (including combination weights) have two disadvantages: Unlike FIML and MI, attrition weights often sharply reduce the analytical sample size and, thereby, statistical power. Typically, only those participants with data at every wave are assigned an attrition weight and used in subsequent analyses. This problem is compounded as a study's number of waves (and therefore attrition) increases. Second, if many auxiliary variables (i.e., non-model variables related to missing data) are incorporated, FIML and MI may adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights. Most statistical packages can use FIML, including STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS, and AMOS, and many use MI (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS). Most large-scale data sets were collected using complex sample designs that entail a clustered sampling design (e.g., schools are randomly sampled and then all students within the selected schools are sampled). <br>Because a clustered sampling design reduces variance (e.g., 100 students from the same school are likely more similar to one another demographically than are 100 students from 100 different schools), it also reduces standard errors and thereby inflates the change for <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. To adjust for these design effects, a primary sampling unit variable (e.g., schools) and potentially a stratification variable are incorporated into analyses. Most statistical packages (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS) can adjust for a complex sampling design and typically the appropriate primary sampling unit and, if necessary, stratification variables are clearly identified within a data set's documentation files. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@davis-keanansweringdevelopmentalquestions2015.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Developmental Systems Perspective Adolescent development is best understood as a dynamic interplay between the individual and their changing context. Long-term impact of adolescence While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. Developmental Systems Model This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. This model emphasizes Change and Relative Plasticity Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development Relationism and Integration Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. Historical Embeddedness and Temporality Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. Implications for Research and Application This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions. 'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes. This knowledge will inform effective policies and interventions to maximize the positive potential of adolescence for individuals and society as a whole. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/1..html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/1..md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 03:24:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introduction to Criminal Investigation, Processes, Practices, and Thinking]]></title><description><![CDATA[
People constantly construct knowledge, and we function in a perpetual state of assessing the information that is presented to us. Interpreting the perceptions of what we see and what we hear allows us to reach conclusion about the world around us. The investigator's interpretation of information and evidence commonly requires answers to many questions that can lead critical of decisions, action, and outcomes, such as: What must be done to protect the life and safety of persons?
Should force, up to and including deadly force, be used to resolve a situation?
Who will become the focus or subject of a criminal investigation?
What is the best plan to apprehend the person or persons responsible for a criminal act?
Will someone be subjected to a search of their person or of their home?
Will someone be subjected to detention or arrest and questioning for a criminal act?
Will someone have a criminal charge sworn against them?
Will someone be subjected to a criminal trial?
Will someone's liberty as a free person be at-risk?
Will justice be served?
Will the community be protected? The investigator must always be ready to explain their thinking and actions to the court. Thinking must illustrate an evidence-based path to forming reasonable ground for beliefs and subsequent action. Thinking must demonstrate consideration of the statutory law and case law relevant to the matter being investigated. Investigation is the collection and analysis of evidence. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/books/introduction-to-criminal-investigation,-processes,-practices,-and-thinking.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Research Citations/Books/Introduction to Criminal Investigation, Processes, Practices, and Thinking.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:34:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bibliography: Nichols, M.

The Undeclared War: We came to think of asylums as places of cruelty and detention, they were originally built to rescue the insane from being locked away in family attics.
Therapists began to notice that often when a patient got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member.
Patients often improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home.
Parents use their children as a buffer to protect them from intimacy. Small Group Dynamics: Group dynamics were applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group.
The Group Mind (1920) (McDougall) A group’s continuity depends on boundaries for differentiation of function and on customs and habits to make relationships predictable. <br>Field theory by <a data-href="Kurt Lewin" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/kurt-lewin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kurt Lewin</a>. He developed the notion that a group is more than the sum of its parts. Quasi-stationary social equilibrium: changing group behavior requires ‘unfreezing.’ Only after something shakes up group’s beliefs will its members be prepared to change. In individual therapy this process is initiated by the unhappy experiences that lead people to seek help.
More effort is required to unfreeze, or shake up, families before real change can take place. The need for unfreezing foreshadowed early family therapists’ concern about disrupting family homeostasis.
<br><a data-href="Wilfred Bion (1948)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/wilfred-bion-(1948).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wilfred Bion (1948)</a>:
Fight-flight, dependency, and pairing: Some families skirt around hot issues like a cat circling a snake. Others use therapy to bicker endlessly, never really contemplating compromise, much less change.
Dependency masquerades as therapy when families allow therapists to subvert their autonomy in the name of problem solving.
Pairing is seen in families when one parent colludes with the children to undermine the other parent. Process/Content: Experienced therapists learn to attend as much to how people talk as to the content of their discussions. <br><a data-href="Role Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/role-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role Theory</a>: the expectations that roles carry bring regularity to complex social situations.

Roles tend to be complementary. Eventually parents of misbehaving children may become polarized into complementary roles of strictness and leniency. What makes such reciprocity resistant to change is that the roles reinforce each other.
Group and family therapy are similar: Both are complex and dynamic, more like everyday life than individual therapy. In groups and families, patients must react to a number of people, not just a therapist, and therapeutic use of this interaction is the definitive mechanism of change in both contexts.
It turns out that the differences between families and groups are so significant that the group therapy model has only limited applicability to family treatment. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy very different from group therapy.
This feeling of safety among sympathetic strangers cannot be part of family therapy because instead of separating treatment from a stressful environment, the stressful environment is brought into the consulting room. <br><a data-href="The Child Guidance Movement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Child Guidance Movement</a>: It was Freud who introduced the idea that psychological disorders were the result of unsolved problems of childhood.

Repeated experience.
A primary negative injunction, such as "Don't do X, or I will punish you."
A second injunction at a more abstract level conflicting with the first, also enforced by punishment or perceived threat.
A tertiary negative injunction prohibiting escape and demanding a response. Without this restriction the victim won't feel bound. Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer necessary once the victim is conditioned to perceive the world in terms of double binds; any part of the sequence becomes sufficient to trigger panic or rage. Most examples of double binds in literature are inadequate because they do not include all the critical features. An example of a double bind would be a teacher who urges his students to participate in class but gets impatient if one of them actually interrupts with a question or comment. A schizophrenic has to deal with them continually - and the effect is maddening. Unable to comment on the dilemma, the schizophrenic responds defensively, perhaps by being concrete and literal, perhaps by speaking in metaphors. Eventually, the schizophrenic may come to assume that behind every statement lies a concealed meaning. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families cause schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for the tragedy of their children's psychoses. <br><a data-href="Theodore Lidz" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/theodore-lidz.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Theodore Lidz</a>: Lidz refuted the notion that maternal rejection was the distinguishing feature of schizophrenic families.

Example: Parent telling a child who is feeling sad, 'You must be tired.' (Go to bed and leave me alone)
Mystification distorts feelings and, more ominously, reality. When parents mystify a child's experience, the child's existence becomes inauthentic. Because their feelings aren't accepted, these children project a false self. In mild instances, this produces a lack of authenticity, but when the real self/false self split is carried to extremes, the result is madness. <br>From Research to Treatment: <a data-href="The Pioneers of Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/the-pioneers-of-family-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Pioneers of Family Therapy</a>: Who started family therapy? <br>Distinction should be shared by <a data-href="John Elderkin Bell (1951)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/john-elderkin-bell-(1951).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">John Elderkin Bell (1951)</a>, <a data-href="Don Jackson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Don Jackson</a>, <a data-href="Nathan Ackerman" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/nathan-ackerman.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nathan Ackerman</a>, and <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a>.

A corollary of the rules hypothesis is that family members use only a fraction of the full range of behavior available to them. This is what makes family therapy so useful.
Jackson’s therapeutic strategies were based on the premise that psychiatric problems resulted from the way people behave with each other.

Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia Emphasized theory
<br>Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).

They wanted to have maximum impact in a short amount of time, so they worked intensively with the families for two full days.
Team approach continues to be one of the hallmarks of the field. Norman Paul developed an operational mourning approach designed to resolve impacted grief. Fred and Bunny Duhl set up the Boston Family Institute, where they developed integrative family therapy.
The McMaster model goes step by step—elucidating the problem, gathering data, considering alternatives for resolution, and assessing the learning process — to help families understand their own interactions and build on their newly acquired coping skills. Robin Skynner (1976) introduced psychodynamic family therapy at the Institute of Family Therapy in London; British psychiatrist John Howells (1971) developed a system of family diagnosis as a necessary step for planning therapeutic intervention; and West German Helm Stierlin (1972) integrated psychodynamic and systemic ideas in treating troubled adolescents. In Rome, Maurizio Andolfi worked with families early in the 1970s and established a training clinic that continues to accept clients and students today. In 1974 Andolfi also founded the Italian Society for Family Therapy; in Milan, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her colleagues founded the Institute for Family Studies in 1967. The Golden Age of Family Therapy: While they were struggling for legitimacy, family clinicians emphasized their common beliefs and downplayed their differences. 1960s: The leading approach to family therapy in the 1960s was the communications model developed in Palo Alto. 1970 to 1985: Classic schools of family therapy as the pioneers established training centers and worked out the implications of their models.

Instead of grasping the principles on which they were predicated, many therapists just tried to imitate his “uncommon techniques.”
To be any kind of competent therapist, you must keep your psychological distance from the supreme artists - the Minuchins, the Milton Ericksons, the Michael Whites. Otherwise you end up aping the magic of their styles rather than grasping the substance of their ideas. <br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>'s Strategic Directives: Wonderful way to gain control over people—for their own good—without the usual frustration of trying to convince them to do the right thing.

The original difficulty becomes a problem when mishandling leads people to get stuck in more-of-the-same solutions. Milan Group: Ideas pioneered at the MRI, especially the use of the therapeutic double bind, or what they referred to as counterparadox. Paradox and Counterparadox Appeal of Approach: Pragmatism
Making use of the cybernetic metaphor, strategic therapists zeroed in on how family systems were regulated by negative feedback. They achieved results simply by disrupting the interactions that maintained symptoms. Limitations: Interventions were transparently manipulative. <br><a data-href="Structural Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/structural-family-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Structural Family Therapy</a>: Straightforward way of describing family organization and a set of easy-to-follow steps to treatment. 1970s; Drew people to epicenter of family therapy movement: the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic The Postmodern Revolution: Postmodernism: family therapy models all had one thing in common: They each assumed there were certain “truths” about families and systems. Each model has embedded within it certain assumptions about the good life: what families should look like, how people should feel and act, and so forth Conclusion: Minuchin assumed that the hierarchical structure of a healthy family looked a certain way—parent(s) in charge, establishing order and providing for the family, while children remain subordinate, accommodating to family rules.
Bowen’s ideal family consisted of differentiated individuals, each simultaneously free to pursue their own growth and development while at the same time honoring their commitments to support one another

The process by which a system gets information necessary to maintain a steady course. Includes information about the system's performance and the relationship among the system's parts. If you see behavior that persists over time, there is likely something maintaining that behavior
Feedback loops can be negative or positive, or the effect they have on homeostasis, not whether they are beneficial.

Early family therapists tended to overemphasize negative feedback and resistance to change. <br><a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>: Reinforces the direction a system is taking. Positive feedback can have desirable or undesirable consequences. If left unchecked, the reinforcing effects of positive feedback tend to compound a system's errors, leading to a runaway process. Malignant worry, phobic avoidance, and other forms of neurotic behavior may start out with a relatively trivial concern and escalate into an out-of-control process. Example: a panic attack may start out as a relatively harmless instance of being out of breath, but a panicky response to breathlessness may spiral into a terrifying experience. Feedback loops indicate a basic circularity where each element has an effect on the next, until the last element 'feeds back' the cumulative effect into the first part of the cycle. Thus A affects B, which in turn affects C, which feeds back to A, and so on. To survive and adapt to the world around them, all communication systems - including families - need a balance of negative and positive feedback. The cybernetic system turned out to be a useful metaphor for describing how families maintain stability. Cybernetics was the brainchild of MIT mathematician Norbert Weiner (1948). During WWII, Weiner was asked to design a better way to control the targeting of antiaircraft artillery. Weiner's solution was to incorporate a system of internal feedback that enabled antiaircraft guns to regulare their own operations. The signal used to control the artillery was a self-regulating servomechanism - the technical term for the first automated machines.
He distinguish two modes of information, discrete or continuous - digital or analog.

The strategic approach introduced two of the most powerful insights in family therapy: Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions.

In 1967 Haley joined Salvador Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
In 1976 Haley moved to Washington DC with Cloe Madanes he founded the Family Therapy Institute. Madanes currently works with motivational speaker and life coach Anthony Robbins. In 1955 Haley moved back to California. He dies in 2007. Jame Keim in California, who developed an innovative way of working with oppositional children, is ably carrying on the Haley-Madanes tradition. Other prominent practitioners of this model include Neil Schiffin Washington DC; Scott Sells at the Savannah Family Institute; and Jerome Price in Michigan. The MRI model had a major impact on the Milan Associates, Mara Selvini Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo, Gianfranco Cecchin, and Guiliana Prata. The Milan Associates eventually split, with Palazzoli and Prata focusing on invariant prescriptions and eventually incorporating more psycho analytic concepts into their work, and Boscolo and Cecchin focusing on circular questioning. Both groups currently have training centers in Italy. Giorgio Nardone is another prominent Italian family therapist who trained at the MRI. In Pragmatics of Human Communication Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson sought to develop a calculus of human communication, which they stated in a series of axioms. People are always communicating. Since all behavior is communicative and since one cannot not behave, then it follows that one cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. The report (or content) of a message conveys information, while the command is a statement about the relationship. <br><a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>: <br>In families, command messages are patterned as <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>, which can be deduced from repeated patterns of interaction. <br>Jackson used the term <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a> as a description of regularity, not regulation.

Homeostatic mechanisms bring families back to equilibrium in the fae of disruption and thus serve to resist change. <br>Jackson's notion of family homeostasis describes the conservative aspect of family systems and is similar to the cybernetic concept of <a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>. According to the communication analysis, families operate as goal-directed, rule-governed systems. Communications theorists didn’t look for underlying motives; instead, they assumed circular causality and analyzed patterns of communications linked together in chains of stimulus and response as feedback loops. When the response to a family member’s problematic behavior exacerbates the problem, that chain is seen as a positive feedback loop.
The advantage of this formulation is that it focuses on interactions that perpetuate problems, which can be changed, instead of inferring underlying causes, which are often not subject to change. <br><a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>: Strategic therapists made the concept of the positive feedback loop the centerpieve of the model. For the MRI group, this translated into a simple yet powerful principle of problem formation: Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how family members respond to it. Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This only produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, and so on - in a vicious cycle. <br>The family system is reacting to a deviation in the behavior of one of its members within feedback designed to dampen that deviation (<a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>), but has the effect of amplifying the deviation (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>). In most families, unspoken rules govern all sorts of behavior Where a rule promotes the kind of rigid attempted solution described above, it is not just the behavior but the rule that needs to change. <br>When only a specific behavior within a system changes, this is <a data-href="First-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">First-Order Change</a>

Find a way to change the rules in order to interrupt problem-maintaining behavior. Jay Haley added a functionalist emphasis to the cybernetic interpretation with his interest in the interpersonal payoff of behavior. Later, he incorporated structural concepts developed during the years he spent with Minuchin. <br><a data-href="Hierarchical Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchical-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Structure</a>: Haley believed that the rules around the hierarchical structure of a family are crucial and found inadequate parental hierarchies lurking behind most problems. Haley suggested that 'an individual is more disturbed in direct proportion to the number of malfunctioning hierarchies in which he is embedded.' <br>To counter a problem's payoff, Haley borrowed Erickson's technique of <a data-href="Prescribing Ordeals" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/prescribing-ordeals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prescribing Ordeals</a>, so that the price for keeping a symptom outweighed that of giving it up. Like Haley, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her associates focused on power games in families and on the protective function symptoms served for a family. They explored families' histories over several generations, searching for evidence to confirm their hypotheses about how children's symptoms came to be necessary. These hypotheses often involved elaborate networks of family alliances and coalitions. They frequently concluded that patients developed symptoms to protect one or more family members so as to maintain the delicate network of extended family alliances. Strategic therapists say little more than whatever works is normal and that what makes families malfunction are solutions that don't work. <br>According to <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>, normal families, like all living systems, depend on two processes: They maintain integrity in the face of environmental challenges through negative feedback. No living system can survive without a coherent structure. Negative feedback resists disruptions Too rigid a structure leaves a system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. That is why normal families also have mechanisms of positive feedback. Positive feedback amplifies innovations to accommodate to changed circumstances. Recognizing that the channel for feedback is communication makes it possible to state the case more plainly: Healthy families are able to adapt because they communicate clearly and are flexible. <br><a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: Resolutely opposed standards of normality. "As therapists, we do not regard any particular way of functioning, relating, or living as a problem if the client is not expressing discontent with it." By limiting their task to eliminating problems presented to them, they avoided taking any positions regarding how families should behave. The Milan Associates: Did not apply preconceived notions or normative models. By raising questions that helped families examine themselves and that exposed hidden power games, they trusted families to reorganize on their own. <br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a> : Assessments were based on assumptions about sound family functioning. His therapy was designed to help families reorganize into more functional structures, with clear boundaries and generational hierarchy. According to communications theory, the essential function of symptoms is to maintain the homeostatic equilibrium of family systems. Symptomatic families were seen as trapped in dysfunctional, homeostatic patterns of communication. These families cling to their rigid ways and respond to signs of change as negative feedback. Change is treated not as an opportunity for growth but as a threat. There are three explanations of how problems develop: Cybernetic: Difficulties are turned into chronic problems by misguided solutions, forming positive feedback escalations.

One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families usually seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions. <br>Families are organized in <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> with <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> regulating the contact family members have with one another.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure
Seeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family." Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. "Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them." Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.
Maps the family's underlying structure.
Intervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating
Enactment
Structural Mapping
Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
Boundary Making
Unbalancing
Challenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong
Pushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Virginia Satir <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> and <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a>
Two of the newer models - Johnson's (2004) emotionally focused couples therapy and the internal family systems model - have combined the emotional impact of an experiential focus on the individual with a more sophisticated understanding of family systems. Whitaker was the leading exponent of a freewheeling, intuitive approach aimed at puncturing pretense and liberating family members to be themselves.

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href="Paul Watzlawick" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href="Richard Fisch" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. <br><a data-href="Integration of New Possibilities" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Integration of New Possibilities</a> Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?
Is each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness
<br>Accurate <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>
Unconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit
Open body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact
Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href="Role of the Symptom" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/role-of-the-symptom.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role of the Symptom</a> in the System <br>Describe how the symptom maintains the family's homeostasis at an emotional level, often regulating closeness and distance (<a data-href="Distance Regulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distance Regulation</a>; <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>) Family Dynamics Identify salient dynamics Power struggles

Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem.

Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns) This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child? Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. <br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.' The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions.

This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relational, family, or systemic goals
Individual goals The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication: The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.' What do I HEAR and SEE? The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. <br>This is similar to ' <a data-href="videotalk" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href="Solution-Focused Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see? After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. Meanings often connect back to past experiences. What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make? The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: "I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural."; incongruent: "I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.")
Subsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. What DEFENSES do I use? <br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>. What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use? Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'
Most of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques' What is my RESPONSE in the situation? How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?
Incongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change. Satir therapists work with clients to help them express difficult-to-articulate emotions related to the presenting problem. If the clients complain about family members or a difficult life situation, experiential therapists listen closely for the emotions, expressed or unexpressed, that are related to the problem circumstance. They listen not just for the surface emotions, but also for deeper levels of emotion and use questions and empathetic reflections to focus clients on those deeper emotions. If a client tells a story without identifying their emotions directly: "As I listen to you explain what happened to you during that argument, I am getting a sense that you were feeling [name the emotion]. Does that sound right?"
"That sounds like a very difficult situation. Can you share some of the emotions you have been expeirencing as you go through this?" If a client does identify emotions, the therapy can help explore them with questions such as: "You say you were feeling [emotion]. I am wondering if part of you is also feeling [name another emotion that client seems to be experiencing]."
"Can you say more about what feeling [name emotion] feels like for you." Satir coached families in softening rigid family rules by changing them to guidelines. For example, rather than saying "I should not get angry," a client or family was encouraged to revise the limiting rule to "What I am angry, I will express my anger in a way that is respectful to others and myself." Satir encouraged families to have as few rules as possible and to be flexible, adapting them for each context and as children's developmental needs change. <br>Coaching clients in how to have authentic, congruent communication in session, involves the ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' combined with specific communication coaching strategies. When coaching communication, Satir had clients turn their chairs toward one another and gave the clients prompts, such as, "Tell your partner how you feel about what happened on Saturday night." If the client was able to congruently address their partner about this, Satir then prompted the partner to respond in kind, continuing this process until the problem was resolved. When a person had trouble communicating congruently and reverted to a survival stance, Satir interrupted the conversation and suggested how to rephrase the statement or how to make the client's nonverbal communication more congruent (e.g., "Now, can you say that starting the statement with 'I' instead of 'you'?" or "Can you show me the emotion you say you are feeling when you speak to your wife?")

Sculpting involves putting family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family. Either the therapist or the client may direct the sculpting. If family members are directing the sculpting, each person in the family is given the opportunity to sculpt the family as they see it. Sometimes the sculptor assigns each family member to say a line that represents how they may be feeling, thinking, or viewing the situation. Usually, however, the essence of this intervention is to give a nonverbal, symbolic depiction of the family process from each person's perspective. Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses. Through the sculpting process, a person is able to literally see how they are contributing to the problematic family process far more quickly than when the same information is provided with words. When all family members are sculpting, it is generally best to let all family members sculpt how they see the family before allowing discussion of one another's sculpting. Therapists encourage family members to respect each person's subjective experience as illustrated in the sculpting and to use the experience to deepen their understanding of one another. Satir used touch in therapy to initially connect with clients and to encourage and reassure them when they were practicing new ways of communicating. In this way, she underscored emotional context and provided palpable support. She also used touch with children to help teach alternatives to violent behavior and to model for parents how to manage difficult children. In today's practicing environments, touching is generally discouraged because it can easily be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or may make a client feel uncomfortable. Therapists need to carefully consider the legal and ethical issues of using touch. Touch may be appropriate in certain practice and cultural contexts. At minimum, therapists can learn from Satir the importance of coaching clients in touching each other - their children and spouses - in more loving and helpful ways. For example, rather than using a demonstration, therapists can guide a parent on how to hold children who are having a tantrum. <br>A form of psychodrama, the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> is used to allow clients to explore unresolved family issues and life events in the safety of the group setting. <br>The client, who is called the ' <a data-href="Star" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Star</a> ,' first identifies key events in their life chronology and significant sources of influence.

Questions for both: What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?
Can you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?
What role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?
Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy? Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first): Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. (Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)
Ask them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement. Now work with the leaning-in partner: Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. Summary statement: Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?
What do you think the problem is now?
How will you know when the problem is solved?
How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today? So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen? What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?
What changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? How have you managed to cope, ensure, keep going? What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?
On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope? Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. How were you hoping I could help you?
Asking for clients' perceptions
Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
Is this conversation useful? How is it useful? Who is in charge, the person or the problem? Reading between the lines of the problem story
Can you remember a time... What does it say about you... If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
Who benefits from the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
Is the problem always with you? What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict... ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/questions-for-clients.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Questions for Clients.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:13:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Preparing for Co-Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Before each session co-therapists should have a pre-session meeting. Therapists pre-session so that co-therapists are on the same page. During pre-sessioning you should decide on the following: The intention or goals for the session
Agreement on a theoretical model
Create a session specific game plan
Discuss previous sessions, hypotheses, and evaluation of progress
Make decisions about next steps in treatment You should also consider the following questions amongst yourself: What would blow you out of the water?
What would be so shocking that you wouldn't know what to do?
Let's brainstorm what we would do if XYZ occurred in session Examples (arguing, escalation, high conflict, desire to end relationship, risk, etc.) How would you manage that?
What do you anticipate?
What is your theory of what's going on--your theory of the problem? Strategies for the therapy room As a co-therapy team you should determine which strategies you are going to use in the room. What is the role of each therapist and how will you work together. Some strategies to consider: Tag team One starts speaking, while the other would be writing questions, and perhaps nodding occasionally, or making validating and summarizing statements.
Then, when number one (i.e. the one who was speaking) runs out number two is ready. They're ready, because they've been writing questions, and they can jump in with those questions. Preparation and sharing airtime Who will do what in the session? Who is handling assessment or genogram?
Will we ever spend time one on one or break up subsystems of the client system?
Split the joining tasks
Before you go into the room, you decide which member of the couple each therapist will focus on with joining. For example: You're going to join with the husband, and I'm going to join with the wife.
It's very specific who we're each validating, empathizing, and summarizing. If you start asking questions of the husband, it's my job to ask the follow-up questions of the wife. In the same vein with the wife, so that we're like two advocates. Reflecting Team As co-therapists there may be times when you find it appropriate to turn to one another and talk about what is going on or what you notice in the room. This could be used as an intervention or to help determine the next steps in the session.
Example: Co-therapists turn to one another and debate or argue about what is happening with the client system. Have a discussion or debate about what is going on, and then turn back to the couple and say, "Where are we going wrong?, or "How are we getting it right?" ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Preparing for Co-Therapy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:13:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ECR-SF Scoring]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Results consist of two scores for the two separate factors; Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. The minimum score for each scale is 7 and a maximum score of 42. In addition, scores are represented in terms of percentile ranks compared to a normative sample. A percentile of 50 represents typical (and healthy) attachment, whereas higher percentiles represent more difficulties with adult attachment compared to peers.
Attachment avoidance is defined as involving fear of dependence and interpersonal intimacy, an excessive need for self-reliance, and reluctance to self-disclose.
Attachment anxiety is defined as involving a fear of interpersonal rejection or abandonment, an excessive need for approval from others, and distress when one’s partner is unavailable or unresponsive.
People who score high on either or both of these dimensions are assumed to have an insecure adult attachment orientation. By contrast, people with low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance can be viewed as having a secure adult attachment orientation (Brennan et al., 1998). In addition, higher scores are significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, interpersonal distress, or loneliness.

Why are couples behaving so badly? "The average couple waits 6 years before seeking out therapy." (Gottman) In those 6 years there is: Build up of resentments
Reinforced bad habits
No boundary enforcement
Erosion of positive perspective
Unconscious bias kicks - assumptions about purposeful poor behavior choices
Missed bids for attention
Depletion of emotional bank account
Never had any positive role models to begin with From a survey conducted in September 2020: Increases in substance misuse: Alcohol (88%)
Marijuana (37%)
Prescription Opioids (15%) Domestic violence cases increased by 25%-33% globally. How are these influences showing up in the clients in the therapy room? Passive/aggressive behaviors
Shut down/Withdrawn/Stonewalling
Withholding Sex or Avoiding Intimacy
Narcissistic Behavior Responses
Gaslighting
Anger
High Conflict
Boundary Crossing
Persistent and Ongoing Flooding
Unwilling to Repair/Apologize/Take Responsibility How to prepare yourself for the unexpected: When you open your office door, look for body language and non-verbals. Have confidence and KNOW that you are the expert in the room. Own it and be brave. Set the tone at the beginning of the session when you feel something is off. Let the clients know what you feel when you feel it, and be willing to talk about what is happening. (Do not wait for clients to bring it up or ignore it)
Model for your couples that you are going to talk about it, not let things be passive-aggressive or avoid dealing with hot topics. Remind clients who escalate that they are not in therapy to repeat old patterns. Pause and interrupt when you see unacknowledged emotion happening in the room. That is your job. Don't let your couples argue or verbally explode on each other. They can do that at home for free. Take Control. Develop your phrase to create stop-action with clients. Say things like, 'pause, stop,' or call out your client's name, etc. Be direct. What is acceptable and what is not acceptable about words or behavior in the room. What you would like your clients to do instead (as for their positive need). Why it's not okay for them to say or do the thing that you witnessed in the room. Let the clients know how painful it is for you to witness, so you can't imagine what it's like for their partner. Keep your eyes on each client in the room. Are you letting one partner high jack the session? Stop the speaking partner and ask, 'What's coming up for you?' Notice if the other partner checks in. Be mindful of the need to stop and tend to the party not speaking. This is how you keep explosions from getting out of control because you have been checking in on what is happening on the other side of the couch. Step in for clients when they don't have words and find a way to speak their pain to their partner. Keep it fair, so both partners feel you are connected with their pain, needs, and wanted outcomes. Normalize high emotion and disappointment of partner not being able to acknowledge perspectives not because they don't love you. Differences on family of origin, difference in expectations, etc. Prior traumas and life experiences make it hard for partners to always regulate their emotions in ways they would hope. Untreated mental health issues impact ability to manage emotions. Not finished working on the 'Me' stuff versus the 'We' stuff and bleeding over into our relationship. Discuss the impact of substances and the impact it has on being able to manage emotions. Gottman Method: Flooding is expected because partners are experiencing physiological arousal. Utilize pulse oximeters to help validate their elevated heart rate. Be okay with breaking it up. Sometimes you need to have one couple leave the room while you do some one-on-one with the other partner. Let an explosive partner leave if they want. Don't chase them or try to convince them to stay or come back. Talk about the flooding in the room and share ways to help self-regulate, like taking deep breaths or pausing to find ways to reframe. You need to be prepared when working with couples that you might need to a break from couples therapy or stop all together based on how the clients present. This is your call as a therapist to evaluate if working with the couple is contraindicated because of co-occurring mental health, substance, unresolved trauma, suicidal ideation, personality disorders, characterological DV, or anger management issues. Often necessary to request that clients seek out individual therapy to strengthen their individual coping skills before attempting additional couples' therapy. Expect your clients to disagree and give you pushback. Attitude is everything in this conversation. Remember, your clients are not your peers, and we often have to make unpopular decisions about the course of care. When you feel anxious and flooded as the therapist: Notice where you are breathing. Plant both feet on the floor. Take your shoulders back against your chair, take a deep breath into your belly, and repeat to yourself: "This is not my pain to feel." Get in touch with your client's inner 5-year-old old in the room. What is hurting them, and what is the catastrophe scenario that is playing out for them?
When I de-escalate, so do my clients. When my voice gets softer and quieter, so does my clients, and they can often match my tone and calm demeanor. Don't shy away from acknowledging they have the right to feel upset, and it makes sense they would be even if their partner does not agree. Ask their partner to find something they said that they can validate for their partner. Remind them this is not the same as agreeing. Focus on the behavior or the words you heard. We can help facilitate meaningful conversation about the emotions each partner is feeling. Ask the partner who is feeling a big emotion related to their partner to name their emotion. Then talk the behavior they say their partner do or the words they heard them say. Remind and monitor clients to avoid telling their partner their evaluation of why their partner did it or the mind set they were in when it happened. This often happens and only creates defensiveness in their partner. No one likes to be told how they feel. Ask for your positive need. Even if the answer is no - you need to hear yourself asking for your need. Gottman Method Stress Reducing Conversation 10-minutes each partner. Listening for understanding and share emotion. (Not problem-solving)
How do clients know it's working? Does your partner feel hear and understood? Then yes. Use of open-ended questions to help partners attune, connect, and provide empathy and support. Questions that allow for each partner to draw out their partner's experience, such as: "What is this like for you? What do you need? What don't you like about this situation?" Gottman Method Dreams within Conflict Asks clients to suspend problem-solving so they can have a better understanding of the childhood stories, values, or core ethics and beliefs that keep their partner rooted in their perspective. Clients take turns asking each partner a set of questions so they can better experience what it's like to walk in their partner's shoes. Preparation for compromise like partners who love each other. Gottman Method Injuries Exercise Helps partners find a structured and safe format to talk about old injuries in a way that helps facilitate compassion, acceptance, and understand about prior and shared traumas.
Creates awareness and insight about the impact and ways these traumas have shaped the way each partner views their world.
Helps evaluate how clients have learned to cope and survive. Can help some clients gain insight on how they behave in relationships in ways that no longer serve them.
Helps couples therapist normalize and make recommendations of ways those old injuries get triggered in the relationship and behavior changes that might be beneficial. Gottman Method Appreciations Exercise Changes tone and energy in session.
Allows each partner to find something positive to notice about their partner to demonstrate holding each other from a positive perspective.
Makes deposits into each partner’s emotional bank account.
Starts conversations about how to do small things often in the relationship for highly disconnected couples.
Way to end session, so couples can ground before leaving in turmoil. If apologies are made, they are often expressed as implying you misunderstood something but without remorse for poor behaviors
Outside behaviors or the other person is ALWAYS the source of conflict or turn it around on the other person implying they are really the culprit for the issue
Self-doubt creeps in and the partner being gaslit internalizes their lack of hard work in the relationship as the cause of all the problems.
Guilt develops about bringing up issues in the relationship.
It feels very much like the result of narcissistic behavior responses.
The partner who is doing the gaslighting may do so unconsciously to gain control or power in the relationship when they feel out of resources or support.
Manipulation that involves making someone question their own reality, feelings, and experiences of events, in order to maintain CONTROL over that person. Deflecting the other person by use of lack of acknowledgement, negative body language, and minimizing statements about the other person’s perspective or feelings. Unwillingness to accept any part of the responsibility for a misunderstanding or conflict. Intentional implication that the other person is over-reacting or has fabricated a situation in order to create doubt or challenge the other person’s reality Being cut off from making points, asking questions, or providing input during a disagreement. No acknowledgment of your hurt feelings when expressed. Lacks Empathy.
Clients are often overly invested in using narcissist label with each other. Only 5% of population are diagnosable with narcissistic personality disorder
You should be aware that most clients who have diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder are not going to be served in couples therapy and may be contra-indicated. Gottman Interventions to Bring into Session Introduces the idea that anything our partner does for us is a gift - they are not required to do so because we are in a relationship with each other.
Softened Start Up: This is helpful for the narcissistic leaning partner to learn how to be clear in their needs and learn how to share why it is important to them. This helps them to slowly understand they are not entitled to anything. Appreciations: Help the narcissistic partner to think about what the other person adds to their life and to acknowledge it. Accept the things you can't change. Helpful for both partners to understand there are some things that are unlikely to ever completely be different in their dynamics. Helps partners make a choice about the relationship from that space of acceptance. Aftermath of a Regrettable Incident: Introduction to Narcissistic person about their role in feeling disrespected or unappreciated. Active listening exercises like the Gottman-Rapport You must interrupt patterns of rage, repeated interruptions, storming off, or screaming. Be on the lookout for a partner who has NPD to be overly charming or makes big declarations of victimhood, or says their only goal is “to fight for the relationship.” Avoid becoming a victim of triangulation or becoming caught up in buying into the hope that you can fix the narcissistic behaviors. You MUST be comfortable being direct, holding a strong position of authority in the room, and be willing to call out poor behavior that is impacting the relationship. Strongly suggest and sometimes require that both partners be in individual therapy and check in with this therapist to make sure they are aware of the dynamics happening in the relationship. The only goal you may accomplish is validating the victim that they are correct in their reality and that they can trust their intuition. You may serve as the objective voice this person needs to get clear and end the relationship. Don’t fight, argue, or try to overpower the narcissist.
There is a very strong likelihood that despite your support that these sessions may not go as you hope! Many clients who have narcissistic behaviors can and will use the tools they learn in session to abuse, further manipulate, or weaponize against their partner. True NPD will NOT be ok with the change in or loss of power and will retaliate. Evaluate if the partner is becoming more agitated, aggressive, and if you suspect there is an increased likelihood for physical abuse-stop sessions. Recognize you can and potentially should take a break from therapy with the couples. Should you refer them to seek individual therapy for a while and then re-evaluate if they are good candidates for couples therapy? Couples therapy can re-traumatize the partner who is being victimized. Consider if this is in the scope of your practice? Do you need to refer out? Make time before letting clients go to let them know that it was a hard session and how important it was to have it. Let your partner know that if they are flooded when they will come back and talk about it with you. Make a date with each other to come back and process. Check in with each partner about what they will do to self-soothe. Remind clients that emotions and feeling hurt or misunderstood happens in relationships. The couple is not in this situation because they don’t love each other but because the stakes are so high. This is your person and if we are not ok then nothing feels ok. Let them know you are proud of them for doing the work.

Increase understanding of the prevalence, characteristics and impact of trauma on individuals. Understand the neurobiology of trauma and how the stress response system impacts functioning. Identity and apply trauma-informed strategies for deescalating crisis situations and working with people who are emotionally distressed. An event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects. Abuse, neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, incarceration of family members, family substance abuse, sudden or expected loss of a loved one Exposure to war, political violence, torture, forced displacement, migration and acculturation stressors, fears of deportation Pain, injury and serious illness; invasive medical procedures or treatments Lack of resources, support networks, or mobility; financial stressors; homelessness Hurricanes, fires, floods Accidents, wars, environmental disasters, acts of terrorism Robberies, shootings, assault, gang-related violence, hate crimes, group trauma affecting a particular community Threats, fights, school shootings, bullying, loss of a student or staff member Exposure to multiple traumatic events from an early age.
The immediate and long-term effects of these experiences over development. "The cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations, including the lifespan, which emanates from massive group trauma." (Braveheart)
Examples: American Indian and Alaskan Native communities
Communities of color
Holocaust survivors
Japanese-American survivors of internment camps
LGBTQ communities Potentially traumatic experiences resulting from: Direct experiences of racial harassment
Witnessing racial violence toward others
Experiencing discrimination and institutional racism A single traumatic event that is limited in time Experiencing multiple traumatic events Exposure to chronic trauma which impacts the child's development Usually caused by adults entrusted with the child's care NORMAL response/reaction to stress and even trauma (4-6 weeks) Exaggerated and prolonged stress response beyond 4-6 weeks and even years later Dysregulation of stress chemistry - stress hormone levels don't decrease
Increased activation of Sympathetic Nervous System (heart rate, startle response, fight response) 70% of adults in the US have experienced some types of traumatic event at least once in their lives. 223.4 million people In public behavioral health, over 90% of clients have experienced trauma.
Trauma is a risk factor in nearly all behavioral health and substance use disorders. Collaboration between the CDC and Kaiser Permanente study of over 17,000 adult patients in health maintenance organizations (1995-1997); 2 waves of data collection
Gathers information about health history and exposure to the following events prior to age 18: Recurrent physical abuse
Recurrent emotional abuse
Sexual abuse
An alcohol or drug abuser
An incarcerated household member
Someone who is chronically depressed, suicidal, institutionalized or mentally ill
Mother being treated violently
One or no parents
Emotional or physical neglect “How ACEs influence health and wellbeing through lifespan.png” could not be found. Nearly two-thirds Ohioans have been exposed to ACEs
Ohioans more likely to experience multiple ACEs: People of color
People with low-income
People with a disability
Residents of urban and Appalachian counties Stress: Unpredictable, Severe, Prolonged -&gt; Vulnerability
Predictable, Moderate, Controlled -&gt; Resilience Natural response to the prolonged uncertainty and disruption caused by a pandemic Lack of motivation
Stress over tasks that would generally be managed well
Changes in eating or sleeping habits
Irritability
Feelings of hopelessness
Difficulty concentrating At any given point in time, we have a limited supply of 'adaptive energy'
In the best of conditions, this reservoir is quite high and will allow us to meet unusual challenges
Chronic and prolonged stress related to COVID-19 and other stressors has depleted the reservoir of adaptive energy, making us all more vulnerable to stress. The amygdala senses threat and sets off the alarm. Thinking brain assess the situation. Thinking brain goes offline. Emotional brain activates fight or flight response. Thinking brain helps shut off the alarm and helps us to calm down. An experience becomes traumatic when it overwhelms our system for responding to stress. The emotional brain continues to sound the alarm and send messages to fight or flee, even after the threat has passed. Autonomic Nervous System: Direct role in physical response to stress. Sympathetic Nervous System: 'Fight or flight' response
Body shifts energy resources toward fighting off or fleeing a threat
Signals release of adrenaline and cortisol
Heart beats faster, respiration rate increases, blood vessels in arms and legs dilate, digestive process changes, glucose levels in blood (sugar energy) increase Parasympathetic Nervous System: Facilitates recovery once acute stressor is over
Over-activity can contribute to stress reactions Chronic stress can result in a long-term drain on the body Wear and tear
Continuous activation of the nervous system can be problematic in all systems. Musculoskeletal System: Muscles in body are in constant state of guardedness Muscle tension, headaches, migraines, back pain Respiratory System Shortness of breath
Rapid breathing Cardiovascular System Elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, elevated stress hormones, inflammation Endocrine System Increased production of cortisol Gastrointestinal System Changes in gut bacteria, pain, bloating, discomfort Esophagus Eat more or less than usual, increased use of substances, heartburn/acid reflux History of previous exposure to trauma
Age of exposure Gender
Cognitive ability
Self-efficacy
Biological factors (e.g. flexibility in thinking, emotional regulation) Nature of the traumatic event
Proximity to the traumatic event
Culture and ethnicity
Level of social support
Quality of parent-child relationships, parent mental health, and parental history of trauma
Health of the broader community Positive: Resilience A positive, adaptive response to significant adversity. Adaptable, caring, and supportive relationship with an adult. A sense of mastery over life circumstances. Strong executive function and self-regulation skills.
Affirming faith or cultural traditions Individuals may demonstrate resilience in one type of situation but not another. Coping skills that support resilience can be developed at any age. Children do not develop the capacity to positive adapt to adversity in isolation. Regardless of resources, individuals who face extreme adversity are likely to be significantly impacted. We all play an important role in fostering resilience. Recovery
Post-traumatic growth Negative: Severe persisting distress
Decline
Stable maladaptive functioning We need to presume the clients we serve have a history of traumatic stress and exercise “universal precautions” by creating systems of care that are trauma-informed. Understanding trauma and its impact
Promoting safety
Ensuring cultural competence
Supporting control, choice, autonomy
Collaboration and mutuality
Integrating care
Healing happens in relationships
Recovery is possible Bringing a volatile and potentially explosive situation to a peaceful, calm resolution by verbal means... and no one getting hurt.

Objects around that could be used for violence?
Open path to exit? Think and plan ahead Be familiar with agency policies/procedures
Develop plans for 'high risk' clients in advance Develop plans for common scenarios based on your role, department, program, etc. Monitor and manage your own stress level Clients in crisis require structure and boundaries to help re-establish stability
Engaging client in discussion (repeated concerns can inadvertently contribute to chaos and triangulation; following the identified plan is the best way to support and care for these clients)
Parallel Process: Don't get pulled into the chaos
Setting firm, clear boundaries creates safety and minimizes potential for triangulation and miscommunication Identifying single point of contact for clients help ensure we have clear, consistent communication and avoids potential for triangulation People are doing the best they can to get their needs met
Escalation is likely a learned behavior
Be PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE Attend to person before things escalate Stage 1: Anxiety/Agitation
Stage 2: Argumentative/Defensive
Stage 3: Verbally, Physically Threatening
Stage 4: Assaultive The more threatened the individual, the more 'primitive' (or regressed) becomes the style of thinking and behaving. When a traumatized person is in a state of alarm: They will be less capable of concentrating
They will be more anxious
They will pay more attention to non-verbal cues Tone of voice, body posture, and facial expressions Trigger: Any stimulus that acts as a reminder of past overwhelming experience Internal: Body sensations, emotions, etc. External: Sounds, sights, smells, facial expressions, etc. Common triggers: Unpredictability, sudden change, transitions
Loss of control
Feeling vulnerable
Feeling rejected
Confrontation
Loneliness
Sensory overload
Intimacy (safety, love, security, family)
Peace, calm, quiet 'Re-Experiencing' can lead to out-of-control behavior When someone with a trauma history begins to escalate, it may be because they are remembering or re-experiencing a traumatic event
They may be reminded of the trauma and be flooded or overwhelmed with memories of that earlier traumatic event. Remember your superpowers: Body language Facial expression
Posture
Position Tone of voice
Active listening Calm and caring attitude
Ask for help Someone who is escalated is under stress and not likely to think clearly
Your perception of your ability to cope with the situation is going to impact your own stress level when managing these interactions
De-escalation skills start with self-awareness. Understanding how stress affects how you act, think, and communicate Speak in a calm, slow, warm, clear voice
Show that you care
Be aware of your non-verbal communication
Acknowledge feelings
Maintain eye contact (but don't stare)
You may need to repeat yourself; the client may be distracted
Be patient; give the situation time; time is on your side
Remain a friendly tone and join with the client Helps the client see that you and the client are a team
"We are going to figure this out" Allow the client to vent ("Tell me more about that")
Use 'Please' and 'thank you' often
Accept the client's feelings, thoughts and behaviors without judgement Remember that most of us have been irrational and said inappropriate things when we are under extreme stress Effective communication often depends as much on how you say the words you choose as much as the words themselves
Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings
Alert others, if needed
Evaluate each situation for violence
Keep an open path
Remove yourself/others if situation is getting out of control Open up clear lines of communication
Build trust and validate the client's situation (even if you don't agree)
Get the client talking about concerns as a route to calming
Gather the necessary information to make a good resolution If a client is escalated, they feel out of control which tells us that their normal coping measures are not working
Keep your focus. You are trying to give the client a sense that they are in control. When someone feels out of control, they are more likely to escalate Your ability to engage a client in conversation successfully can resolve the conflict
If it seems you may not get there, ask for help Shows interest
Close-ended questions may be necessary but client is more likely to tell you what you want to hear
"What can I help you with today?" vs. "Do you want to schedule an appointment?"
"What time of day works best for you?" vs. "Can you come at 2 pm?"
"Can you tell me..." Being expressively/explicitly kind
Builds rapport and nurtures competence "I appreciate you telling me what's wrong."
"It took a lot of courage for you to reach out today."
"You've done a great job of keeping your appointments in the past. We really appreciate that." Validates and shows you’ve heard the client
Mirror back what you’re hearing is going on • Allow further explanation of the concern by not inserting your opinion
Listen for feelings, themes, motivations, unmet need “It sounds like you’ve had a really tough time.”
“You’re really angry about what’s happened.” “You’re ____.” Insert any emotion—“mad,” “upset,” “frustrated,” “worried,” etc. You can’t do it wrong! “Sounds like…”
“Seems like…”
“It feels like…”
“To you, it looks like…”
“I am hearing…”
“I am wondering if…” Help transition the client to resolution: “So you’ve been through a lot and you’re really upset about everything that’s happened before. It sounds like we need to get you in to talk to someone. Would it be okay to get you scheduled for an appointment?”
“The last time you were here, you thought you got the run around and didn’t have time to see the provider. You were really frustrated by all that. How about if we get you scheduled again and see if we can get things resolved?” Remember the overall goal - client care
If you take a LESS authoritative, LESS controlling, LESS confrontational approach, you actually will have MORE control in the situation. Responding angrily
Not listening
Criticizing
Being defensive
Arguing with the client
Engaging in power struggles
Ordering the client what to do Threatening (to cancel an appointment, etc.)
Minimizing the importance of the client's concern
Moving quickly (can be perceived as aggressive) Saying "You need to calm down"
Trying to be right
Giving commands "lower your voice" Arguing with the client
Taking the words or actions of the client personally (even if the client tries to make it personal)
Minimizing the situation ("It is not that bad")
Asking a lot of questions
Asking 'Why' questions
Forcing discussion Do not express anger, impatience, or irritation Breathe
Take a moment away, if possible Never use inflammatory language ("You are acting crazy")
Notice if you are feeling as though you have to rush or feeling like you are stuck if it takes time to get to work through the client interaction Breathe through it, be patient
Request help, if needed Don't intervene too quickly or try too hard to control the interaction by interrupting or talking over the client Follow agency policy Document Debrief Strategies to manage/avoid similar situations in future What went well? What didn't go well?
Did anything contribute to the escalation?
Did anything help diffuse the situation? Support for staff, clients, and individuals involved People are coping the best way they can - our job is to help them find a better way
Requires building trust, creating safety, and creating a trauma informed culture that provides a safe and healing environment
Healing takes more than therapy Support services can create therapeutic, healing experiences - a place of safety Screen for trauma history
Deepen attunement skills - learn to interpret behavior effectively as communication
Employ person-centered, strengths-based thinking and language
Provide stability and empowerment
Consider the physiological, psychological, and social risks of physical interventions - choose the least restrictive option as a last resort if somebody is a danger to themselves or others
Prioritize debriefing after a crisis to help foster resilience and develop successful coping skills Be empathetic and non-judgemental
Respect personal space
Use non-threatening non-verbals
Avoid overreacting
Focus on feelings
Ignore challenging questions
Set limits
Choose wisely what you insist upon
Allow silence for reflection
Allow time for decisions

The acute phase of a suicidal crisis is when a person is ready to actually make an attempt to end their life. Suicidal crises are often brief. While some attempts follow a long period of deliberation, other attempts are acted on hastily and may be difficult to predict. Most people who attempt suicide don't necessarily want to be dead, but they want the pain they feel to stop. Most people who attempt suicide and survive do not ultimately kill themselves - even people who make a very serious suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Crisis: The period when a person transitions from being at risk for suicide or considering suicide to being ready to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;make an attempt. Can come on rapidly
Can be difficult to predict
Can lead to an unplanned suicide attempt
People were asked when they has first started thinking about making an attempt; 48% said they starting thinking about it within 10 minutes of attempting. Often brief The period during which a person is actually ready to take their life is usually brief. Rarely is it a chronic state. The impulse to die often fades. It may never recur, or it may flare up episodically. Duration of Suicidal Crisis: Evidence by Attempters: 0-10 minutes: 48%
11-60 minutes: 2%
1-24 hours: 9%
1-7 days: 16%
1-4 weeks: 15%
1-12 months: 11% Long-Term Survival: More than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not actually kill themselves. 60% of people who commit suicide die on their first attempt. (Means reduction saves lives by decreasing the likelihood that an attempt will be fatal) In describing the moment he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, Ken Baldwin said, "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped." It is not easy to determine. Examples: Clients who have suicidal thoughts. Clients who are in distress and have attempted suicide in the past. Clients who are struggling with mental health or substance misuse issues, especially if they are also coping with painful life crises. A clinician should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and feelings. Talking about suicide does not create or increase risk, in fact, it can reduce the risk of suicide. A clinician’s ability to calmly, compassionately, and matter-of-factly explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors may encourage an individual to disclose suicidality, if it exists. Often, clients who have considered suicide will be relieved that you raised the subject. Use direct questions about current or past suicidal thoughts and behavior. Let the client know that other people have similar thoughts and feelings.
Any of your clients who have a prior history of suicidality or current distress could benefit from lethal means counseling. If your conversation with your client results in disclosure of past suicidal thoughts or behaviors, probe more about current suicidal feelings. Find out specific details about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Some Questions to Ask: Tell me about a couple of times in the past few months when things were the worst for you—did you think about suicide? If yes, then ask:&nbsp;Did you take any specific steps toward an attempt? What methods did you think about? What kept you alive?&nbsp; Tell me about the last couple of days—how much would you say suicide has been on your mind, if at all?&nbsp; If so, then ask:&nbsp;Are there specific methods you’ve thought about? Have you thought about how you'd kill yourself?&nbsp; If yes, then ask: Have you thought about when or where you'd kill yourself?
If they mention a specific method of suicide, then ask: What other methods are you thinking about? Is there a specific scenario where you think you would attempt suicide?
Have you ever attempted suicide in the past, or started to? Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Lethal means counseling makes sense for anyone at risk.
Individuals who struggle with mental health and/or substance use issues, and who are experiencing a major crisis, stress, or trauma, are also at risk of suicide and should receive lethal means training. Individuals who currently have suicidal thoughts would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who struggle with mental health/substance abuse issues, especially when they are also experiencing painful life crises, would benefit from lethal means counseling. Ask clients at risk directly about suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Ask clients at-risk specifically about their suicide plans, such as how and when they would do it. Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. People sometimes deny these even when they exist. Also, suicidal thoughts can emerge rapidly and many attempts are unplanned. Lethal means counseling should take place before a suicidal crisis occurs. Firearms is the method used most frequently in suicidal deaths. Suicidal Death Rates by Method: 51% Firearms
26% Suffocation/Hanging
12% Poisoning/Overdose (Poisoning from intentional drug or medication overdoses)
3% Gas Inhalation (Inhaling gas, usually carbon monoxide from motor exhaust)
2% Jumping/Falling (Jump from high place like bridge)
2% Cutting (Sharp instruments like razor)
4% Other Methods (like drowning) The lethality of the method used in a suicide attempt is one of the biggest factors determining whether the person lives or dies. While the intent matters, means also matters. If the method a person wants to use for suicide if not available when they are actually ready to go through with an attempt, one of two things is likely to occur: They will delay the attempt as they try to get access to the method they want to use. The greater the delay, the greater the chance the suicidal crisis will pass. They will substitute another method. If the substituted method is less lethal, this increases the chance the person will not die. And most people who survive an attempt do not later go on to kill themselves. The two methods used in the majority of nonfatal suicidal attempts are overdosing with medications and cutting with sharp instruments. Many people think these two methods are far more deadly than they actually are. This misperception may save a lot of lives.
We recommend that you do not share specific information with your clients about the low lethality of sharp instruments and medications. Which suicide methods are amenable to a means reduction approach? It depends on the following criteria: Number of Suicide Deaths: The number/percent of suicide deaths caused by a specific method. Lethality: The proportion of attempts by a given method that end in death (case fatality rate). Irreversibility: The inability for someone attempting suicide to stop once it has begun or to be rescued. More people stop an attempt than carry through with it. Accessibility: The immediate availability of the method. Access is particularly important when attempts occur rapidly with little or no planning. Acceptability: Cultural and/or individual tolerance or preference for using a particular method to kill oneself. Cutting: Low Number of Deaths

High Acceptability Firearms are used in more suicide deaths in the US than all other methods combined. They are also highly lethal irreversible, and easily accessible in many homes with guns (one-third of homes have guns). Since gun owners can voluntarily undertake steps to reduce access, you will want to discuss safe firearm storage with all clients at-risk of suicide. Medication Overdoses are not as lethal as firearms (though some medications and poisons are very lethal). It is also usually possible for someone to stop an overdose mid-attempt or to be rescued. However, overdose is by far the most frequent method of attempt, and medications are easily accessible in most homes. Therefore, it is wise to routinely advise at-risk clients to dispose of unnecessary medications and keep accessible only quantities that do not pose a lethal threat. When your client's suicidal ideation focuses on any other method, you will want to discuss with them ways to reduce access to that method. More suicide deaths are from firearms than any other method in the US. Firearms, jumping, and suffocation are most lethal than other methods. Cutting and poisoning/overdose have low lethality, on average. The method used in a suicide attempt can determine whether the person lives or dies. Use a method reduction approach for any lethal method that is mentioned by clients at risk. How amenable each method is to a means reduction approach depends on the following criteria: Frequency
Lethality
Irreversibility
Accessibility
Acceptability Since firearms are used in most suicide deaths and they are also highly lethal, acceptable, and accessible (in homes with guns), be sure to ask all clients at risk if they have access to firearms and discuss ways to reduce access. A method is considered lethal if a high proportion of attempts by that method end in death.
Approximately 80%-90% of intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates.
Only 1%-2% of intentional, self-inflicted wounds from sharp instruments, like a razor, are fatal. Cutting is not a highly lethal method. However, it is the second most commonly used method in attempts. Only 1%-2% of intentional overdoses or poisonings are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates. This is on average, however, certain medications and poisons are far more lethal than others. In addition, medication overdoses are the most common method of suicidal attempts. People who attempt suicide typically struggle with ongoing mental health or substance abuse issues.
While some attempts are planned, many are not. Acute suicidal crises are often brief, and escalation from thought to action can occur rapidly.
The lethality of the method used in an attempt can determine whether that person lives or dies. If a highly lethal means is not available, the individual's chance of survival is greater. Over 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not take their life later on, so reducing access to lethal means can save many lives.
An effective way to protect clients at risk of suicide is to reduce their access to highly lethal means before they experience an acute suicidal crisis. Feasibility: Can the client or their family actually take the steps at home to reduce access to the method? Reducing access to&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;and&nbsp;medications used for poisoning/overdose&nbsp;could feasibly be accomplished at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so could potentially save thousands of lives in the U.S. if routinely implemented with people at risk for suicide.
Access can be feasibly be reduced for these two methods: Firearms: Firearms are used in roughly half of all suicide deaths, are highly lethal, and are very accessible if they are kept at home. Medications: Medication overdoses are by far the most common method in suicide attempts. Although the vast majority do not result in death, some medications and medication combinations are highly lethal - and, if kept unlocked at home, very accessible. We recommend routinely discussing firearm and medication storage with all clients at risk of suicide. If a client's suicidal ideation focuses on a method other than firearms or medication, we also recommend discussing ways to reduce access to that method as well. When discussing firearm storage with clients and their family members, the goal is to maximize the client’s safety by reducing immediate access to firearms as much as possible while they are at risk for suicide. There are two main options for reducing access to firearms.
Safest: Store firearms away from the home: Storing firearms away from home is the most effective way to ensure clients don't have easy access to a gun if they experience a spike in suicidal feelings. Off-site options are listed in the next section. Second-best: Secure storage inside the home: The second-best option is securely locking firearms in the home (or disassembling guns and locking a critical component). The person at risk should not have the keys, know where the keys are kept, or know the combination to the storage unit. Keep in mind that safes and locks can be broken into or picked, some more easily than others. But any measures that put time and distance between a suicidal person and a firearm may save their life. Storing firearms away from the home temporarily until the person improves is the best way to reduce access to them. Self-Storage Rental Units: Many facilities allow firearm storage. Typically, the smallest units are 5 ft. By 5 ft., but some offer storage drawers or bins, which are less expensive. Prices typically include a small one-time administrative fee as well as a monthly charge that depends on unit size. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored in a facility. Friends or Relatives: Storing firearms with a trusted person is an excellent and free option, provided the person is legally allowed to hold them. Some state laws require a background check prior to transfer to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing firearms. Shooting Ranges: Shooting ranges and sportsmen’s clubs sometimes offer locker rentals for a relatively low monthly fee. Typically, only the owner holds the key and no background check is required because the ownership of the guns is not transferred. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored. Law Enforcement: Some law enforcement agencies will temporarily store firearms for safety purposes; others will not. It is best to know the processes and policies in your region before you need to implement these with a client. You or your client should contact the agency first; walking in unannounced with firearms could be mistaken as a threat. Some agencies will pick up the firearms at the person’s home. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required. Most agencies offer disposal services, if that is desired. Gun Shops: Some gun shops offer storage services, and a few specialize in this service (e.g., provide pick-up services, offer discounts for longer-term and multiple gun storage). Prices vary, although some shops will provide regular customers with free storage when there is a safety concern. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required, depending on the type of storage the shop uses. Pawn Shops: Pawning guns for a small loan amount can be a relatively low-cost, secure storage option in most states. Interest charges must be paid monthly. To reclaim their firearms, gun owners must repay the loan and go through a background check to verify they are not prohibited from owning firearms. Clients and family members who decide to store their firearms away from their house usually want to know when it’s safe enough to bring their firearms back into the home. "Yes. … It’s a case-by-case decision based on how the client is doing. Acute suicidal feelings can spike episodically. While these spikes are often brief, they can recur. It is prudent to wait until there has been a relatively long period of stability before returning the guns." Temporary storage of firearms away from the home cannot always be arranged immediately and isn’t always acceptable to the client or others in the home. Store in a gun safe or lock box: Lock guns, unloaded, in a gun safe or lock box. Many gun owners have multiple guns and ALL of them should be locked up, including rifles and self-defense guns. Remove a component: Remove a key component of the guns (such as the slides or firing pins) and lock them up - or better yet, store them away from the home. Use Gun Locks: Trigger locks, cable locks, and clamshell locks aren't as safe as locking in a secure gun safe, but they are better than not locking it at all - and when used in conjunction with a safe, can provide an additional layer of protection. Change the Combination or Key: If guns are already locked, change the combination or key location in case the person at risk knows how to access them. Remove Ammunition: Remove ammunition from ALL firearms. Keep all ammunition out of the home for now - or, at least, locked separately. Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
We recommend triple safety when storing them in the home: Locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked up separately (Ideally away from the home while the client is at risk)
What About a Self-Defense Gun? In some situations, clients or members of their household may want to keep their gun available for self-defense purposes. If this is the case, how you approach the situation and what you say will depend on whether the gun owner or the household member is the person at risk. Person At Risk: If the gun owner is the person at risk: Discuss the specific threats that are a concern to the client and the realistic risk of home invasion crimes.
Find out what other means of protection they would consider, such as self-defense sprays (if legal in your state), flood lights, an alarm system, or a dog.
Discuss what they are willing to do to keep themselves safe from suicide.&nbsp;
Would the client consider locking a self-defense gun and having another family member hold the key? If there’s resistance, consider creative solutions, such as putting pictures of loved ones or other reminders of reasons to live on their gun or lock box to interrupt or slow down a suicidal impulse. Work toward additional steps to reduce access over time. Household Member: If the gun owner is a member of the household: First, discuss the probabilities of suicide attempt versus risk of home invasion in the near term (i.e., the risk of a violent home invasion is very small for most people and is dwarfed by the far greater risk of suicide if a despairing person has a gun close at hand)
If the gun owner is concerned about protecting family members, it may be helpful to mention that part of protecting them is keeping everyone safe from suicide.
If self-defense is determined to be essential, one option is for the gun owner to keep the firearm either on them or in a quick-release handgun safe to which the person at risk has no access. Overdose accounts for roughly two-thirds of suicide attempts treated in the hospital, but only a very small proportion (2% or less) prove fatal. However, some medications are more dangerous than others, especially when taken in combination. With over 250,000 attempts annually, at least 5,000 people die each year from an intentional overdose. According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the medications most frequently involved in overdose suicides are opioids (e.g., prescription pain medications such as oxycodone, methadone, and morphine). 5&nbsp; In suicide deaths by drug overdose, over half tested positive for an opioid. 6&nbsp;Opioids, when used alone or in combination with other types of drugs or alcohol can cause death by depressing the respiratory system. Other drugs that are frequently implicated in overdose deaths include benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolytics and muscle relaxants), antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping pills (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially diphenhydramine—Benadryl), and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). These substances usually do not appear alone but rather in combination with an opioid, with one another, and/or with alcohol. Alcohol use can increase the lethality of an overdose and may increase the risk that the person will carry through with an attempt.
Unfortunately, information about lethal combinations of medications is readily available on the Internet. Safely dispose of all unneeded and outdated medication in the home. Opioids should not be kept at home unless absolutely necessary to manage pain. If opioids must be kept at home, they should be locked and inaccessible to the person at risk. If the at-risk client must take the opioids to manage pain, discuss the possibility of having another household member or support person dispense the pills. In high-risk situations involving opioid use, also keep at least two doses of Narcan Nasal Spray, which is a highly effective rescue drug that lay people can administer. When used in time, Narcan can immediately reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Always lock up abuse-prone drugs such as prescription painkillers, anxiety medications, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Many inexpensive lock boxes can easily be broken into. A steel toolbox secured by a padlock is a safe, inexpensive option. For other necessary medications (both over-the-counter and prescription), only keep on hand limited quantities that would not constitute a serious danger if taken together. Lock up the rest. Advise families to ask their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what constitutes a safe quantity of medication to have in their home. The Poison Control Hotline at 800-222-1222 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) can also provide guidance on safe quantities. A family member or support person should seek this information, not the person at risk for suicide, since the information could be used to increase the lethality of an attempt. Use lower-toxicity rather than higher-toxicity medications, if possible, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant rather than a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant. Limit medication to quantities and combinations that, even if taken all at once, will not do serious harm. Consider requiring weekly refills to reduce lethality and increase contact.
Take into account the client's use of alcohol and other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. Some combinations are more deadly than others. If you have a client with a prescription for psychiatric medications, choose your words carefully so that you don’t send mixed messages or inadvertently inform the person about the lethality of the medications. If a client’s suicidal thoughts focus on methods other than guns or medications, incorporate those methods into your lethal means counseling. For example, if ideation focuses on filling the garage with car exhaust or crashing the car into a telephone pole, and the client has strong suicidal feelings, discuss ways to limit access to the car, such as having a family member hold onto the car keys temporarily.
What if ideation focuses on a certain method? There are times when a client’s ideation focuses on a very specific method that serves as their escape plan and may also have personally significant meaning. For example, your client carries around a belt that he could use to hang himself like his uncle did. If ideation focuses in this very specific way on one particular item, work with the client on agreeing to give up that item for now, while identifying strategies for staying alive. What about methods that cannot easily be restricted at home? Sometimes a client’s ideation focuses on suffocation or other highly lethal methods that are nearly impossible to control access to. These clients may need close supervision from family, friends, or others to ensure they don’t attempt suicide, particularly if their suicidality is of a more chronic or recurring nature. The client may opt to stay in a hospital if they feel the supervision would be helpful. Just One Part of a Safety Plan: In all cases, reducing access to lethal means should be part of a broader collaborative safety plan aimed at helping a client learn how to cope with suicidal feelings, as well as part of a broader therapeutic plan aimed at reducing the reasons for dying and increasing the reasons to live. To reduce access to firearms, the safest option is to store them away from the home. Possible storage options include with a relative or friend; with law enforcement; in a self-storage rental unit; or at a gun shop, shooting range, or pawn shop.
To reduce access to firearms that are stored in the home, use triple safety measures: Lock all firearms (or disassemble guns and lock a critical component), unload all firearms, and lock ammunition separately (or don’t keep ammunition at home for now).
Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
Guns that are kept at home for self-defense must be addressed since they are usually the ones that are most accessible. To reduce access to medications, remove unneeded medications from the home; keep only non-lethal quantities on hand; and lock up abuse-prone drugs, such as prescription painkillers, anxiety pills, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Discuss ways to reduce access to any method a client mentions using. Since escalation to a suicidal crisis can happen rapidly, the goal is to make the home safer for clients at risk before they are actively suicidal. Counseling on access to lethal means is for three types of clients:
Clients who have recently had suicidal thoughts.
Clients who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress. Clients who are struggling with a difficult mental health or substance abuse issue, particularly when they are also coping with a life crisis, such as relationship breakup, housing dislocation, arrest, or financial or job problems. These clients may not be currently suicidal but could become suicidal quickly. Routinely discus ways to reduce access to firearms and medications routinely with any client at risk of suicide. In addition, discuss any other method that a client with suicidal ideation considers using. Lethal means counseling is a client-centered intervention, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Your approach and the language you use are important to making this conversation effective, whether speaking to your client or to their friends and family members. Have a collaborative conversation and work together. With this approach, the client is the expert and the clinician is a resource. Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis as well as the need to reduce access to lethal means. Make specific and feasible plans. Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences. A guiding approach that is collaborative and client-centered is usually best, such as that used in motivational interviewing. Seek input from the client about their own reasons for - and against - reducing access, their own safety concerns, and what they would be willing to do. A collaborative approach accepts the client's values and works from the client's own motivations. "I can see how hard this has been for you lately, and I'm concerned about you. Are you concerned too?"
"What ideas do you have about ways to increase your safety in case you experience suicidal thoughts?" If your client is a gun owner: "Lots of people have guns at home. Some will store their guns outside of their home temporarily - such as at a relative's house or a gun shop - until they are feeling better. What do you think about a strategy like that?" A directive approach has a less collaborative tone and puts the clinician in the role of the expert. With certain clients, this approach may be more appropriate, for example: Clients who are too overwhelmed or stressed to make clear-headed decisions. Clients from certain cultures who may feel more comfortable getting advice rather than being asked for their ideas. Examples of Directive Statements: "I'm going to recommend that for now you store your guns away from home. Is that something you can do?"
"You'd be safer if you stored your guns away from home for now."
"I'm going to suggest you use this gun lock and have your wife keep the key."
"It would be best if you kept only a week's supply of medications at home and had a family member store the rest."
"For now, let's have your partner store your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in a lock box." No Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts: Some clients may disclose that they are suffering but say they are not suicidal. This may well be true for some clients; however, others may in fact be suicidal or likely to become so. If the client is having a very difficult time, and especially if life stressors are also present (e.g., custody battle, painful breakup, upcoming prison sentence, housing dislocation, work troubles), engage them in a conversation about reducing access to firearms and medications in case suicidal feelings develop.
Examples of how to respond to clients who say they are not suicidal: "I'm glad you're not feeling suicidal right now. Sometimes people who are struggling may have a crisis and suddenly experience strong suicidal feelings. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but if it does, I want to be sure you make it through safely and get the help you need. Can we talk over a plan, just in case?" When clients you suspect are suicidal don't disclose: "It's not unusual for people who have experienced the kind of pain you are going through recently to feel like it will last forever and to think they would rather be dead. Can we talk over a plan for how you'd stay safe if you started feeling suicidal?" Some clients, even if they are suicidal, may express resistance to reducing access to lethal means, like firearms. If clients or family members seem resistant, listen to what they say and work collaboratively toward solutions that address their concerns. For instance, some gun owners find the idea of living without a firearm in the home, even temporarily, very difficult. Don’t minimize that this may be a difficult decision. Examples on how to respond to clients who are in denial or resistant: When clients won't tell you whether they have a gun: Will you tell me what you’re worried would happen if you say you have a gun? I may be able to ease those worries. When clients think you are trying to take their gun away: "I am not questioning your right to own guns. Since you’ve talked about feeling suicidal, I’m concerned about helping you stay safe. Have you also been concerned?” When clients are concerned about what will go in their record: “Before we talk about your specific situation, I can let you know what sort of information I will write down and what I can omit.” When a client is concerned about chronic pain: “I hear that you are concerned you won’t have access to your medications during a flare-up. Let’s come up with a plan that supports both your health and safety.” When a family member is resistant to safely storing medications at home: “While it is true your child could get pills from a store, most suicide attempts occur at home with little or no preparation. Let’s talk about a plan that addresses your concerns and also ensures your daughter cannot take enough pills to harm herself.” Conversations about reducing access to lethal means are not always straightforward or easy. This can be especially true when discussing firearms. As a clinician, if you own guns you may feel more at ease raising the topic and more knowledgeable about storage options. If you aren’t a gun owner, it’s possible you might feel uneasy broaching the topic or overestimate client resistance. However, most gun owners value firearm safety and protecting their family—values that dovetail well with preventing suicide. When firearms are a family tradition and bonding experience: Consider alternatives
Discuss safety
Store guns elsewhere When guns provide safety and protection: Weigh concerns: Weigh the safety concerns of suicidality versus the concern of temporarily not having a firearm at home. Consider other options: Consider other things that could help keep the family safe such as pepper spray, alarms, or outdoor motion-detector lighting. Prioritize client's health: Underscore that part of protecting the client's family is ensuring the client is alive and well. Discuss behavioral history: Ask about any history of impulsive or unexpected behavior, and build on that to reinforce your concern. When guns provide security due to PTSD: Ask how client feels: Ask if the client trusts themselves with a loaded gun close at hand. Consider behavioral strategies: Use a behavioral intervention (e.g. behavioral modification, behavior shaping, rehearsal) or other interventions that focus on taking small steps to reduce access and gradually increasing these steps. Talking to Parents/Guardians: When working with a person under age 18 who is at risk for suicide, involve parents or guardians. Let them know that you are concerned about a possible suicide attempt and explain that reducing access to lethal means can reduce the likelihood of a suicide death.
When the youth has expressed suicidal ideation: “The fact that your child has had suicidal thoughts means we need to take the risk of suicide seriously. We’ve talked about getting him into treatment. I’d also like to talk about steps you can take at home to help keep him safe.”
"If a child or teenager attempts suicide, it’s usually at home and it’s often a quick decision. Putting time and distance between them and a method that could do serious harm is one of the single most effective steps to protect your child." When the youth is not currently suicidal but at risk: “I’ve asked her about suicidal thoughts, and she hasn’t disclosed any. Suicide is still a concern when kids are struggling. These thoughts can develop rapidly, often without warning, and can prompt an unplanned suicide attempt. Therefore, we routinely suggest a few important steps you can take at home.”
"With everything going on in your home right now and the impact on your child, it is best to make the environment in your home safer in case a suicidal crisis occurs unexpectedly. It is safest to temporarily remove all firearms from the home and to reduce access to medications, particularly those for pain and other drugs of abuse, while your child is at risk." Since firearms are the leading cause of suicide deaths, be sure to talk with the youth and their parents/guardians about guns in the home. Gather information from youth: Talk to your young clients about whether there are guns in the home and find out if they have access to them.&nbsp;For example, some clinicians ask youth, “How long would it take you to get access to guns in your home?”
Talk to the parents about gun access and storage:
Speak to the adult in the household who is the primary gun owner (unless there are contraindications such as spouse abuse).&nbsp; Find out the following: How are the guns stored in the home? Since gun owners often have more than one, gather information about all of them.
Does their child have access to any of the guns in the home? Many parents underestimate their children’s knowledge about where guns are stored and how to access them (e.g., key or combination).&nbsp;
Are there other homes where the youth stays that may have guns? Discuss all possibilities, such as joint custody situations, relatives, hunting buddies, or other friends.
Make sure the youth cannot hear your discussion (even if it is by phone), especially if there’s a chance the child is unaware of household firearms. Explain the focus on firearms, if necessary: If parents ask why you are focusing on firearms, explain that they are the most lethal method of suicide and that unlike nearly every other method, there’s no opportunity for the person to change their mind or be rescued mid-attempt. Since suicidal feelings are often short-lived and can come on unpredictably, putting time and distance between an at-risk youth and firearms is an effective way to protect them. Lethal means counseling is client-oriented. When discussing lethal means with clients or family members, make it a collaborative conversation. Your approach and the language you use matters. A collaborative, guiding approach is usually best. A more directive approach is less collaborative but may be more appropriate with certain clients. When working with a young person at risk for suicide, always involve parents or guardians. Together with your client, collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means. Depending on the client’s situation, this plan usually covers firearms and medications, as well as any other methods that are the focus of your client’s ideation.
The plan should include the following: Clear roles and tasks: Who will do what (this is especially important to do if others are involved) A timetable: When each part of the plan will be done Family members may not be aware that suicide attempts usually occur with little or no planning and that the method a person chooses often depends on its availability. It can be helpful to inform family members or significant others and to enlist their support in reducing access to lethal means, for example, if there are medications which the client must access daily or occasionally. Benefits: Involving family can be very effective. In fact, families counseled to remove or secure lethal means are far more likely to do so than those who are not counseled. Additionally, results of a pilot study indicate the majority of families reported that the counseling they received was respectful of their needs. Considerations: Some clients will not want you to enlist the help of their family members. In these situations, close friends or peer mentors may be more acceptable and less risky to involve than family members. Collaborate with your client on who would be best to engage.
- Permission:
- Ask your client for permission to talk with others before doing so (e.g., spouse, romantic partner, parents, friends, or peer mentors). For minors (under age 18), you may talk to the parents or legal guardian without the client’s permission. To help maintain your relationship with a minor, however, be sure to inform your client before speaking with a parent or guardian.
- Permission Denied:
- If a client does not give you permission to talk with anyone, yet you believe that removal of a lethal means is necessary for the safety of that individual, this could be considered permissible communication. Consult the current HIPAA guidelines for situations like this.
- Remember, in order to collaborate effectively with a client (or their parents), the clinician should:
- Use language that indicates acceptance of gun ownership without judgement.
- Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis and the need to reduce access to lethal means.
- Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences, recognizing that gun owners tend to prefer language that emphasizes options and autonomy. Consider the Client's Reaction: Before finalizing a plan to reduce access to firearms, or any suicide method, consider your client's reactions to it and the likelihood of follow-through with the plan. If you are working with the parents or guardians of youth, take their reactions into consideration. The client’s (or parents’) response may reveal whether the plan is likely to be carried out. Examples: Initial reluctance from client: Is your client initially reluctant to implement the plan and then relieved when they agree? This may indicate strong commitment to that particular method and a positive indication that, for now at least, they are electing to live. Readily agreeable client: If your client readily agrees to give up access to means and puts up no resistance, you may need to be a little suspicious. Sometimes lack of resistance means that the person is already considering a substitute method or holding something back. For example, the client may be thinking, “Okay, now that I don’t have guns, I’ll just use pills.” If you have doubts, say something like, “Thank you for your help on this. Now I’m wondering what other means you’ve considered and if those means are available to you.” Mixed messages from family members: If you are working with family members and one member is agreeable but the gun-owning family member seems reluctant, this may indicate a lack of commitment by the gun owner to follow through with the plan. Monitor Progress: Document and Monitor: Once you've arrived at a mutually acceptable plan for reducing access to lethal means, document it in your notes. Access to lethal means: For all persons identified at risk for suicide, indicate that you have assessed for specific access to lethal means. Recommendations and Steps: List any recommendations and steps agreed upon with the client to reduce access to lethal means and make the environment safer. Contact with Others: Indicate if you contacted family members or a support person to confirm the removal or securing of lethal means. If the client or family has engaged law enforcement, a pharmacy, or others to hold or dispose of lethal means, this should be documented in the medical records. One way to ensure that lethal means counseling becomes a standard component of working with people at risk of suicide is, where possible, to build prompts into electronic templates and paper forms that serve as a reminder. For example, systems that use electronic medical records can embed specific lethal means documentation into templates for intake assessments, crisis appointments, therapy or medication appointments, and many other appointment types. Recommendations for Follow-Up: Never assume that the agreed-on plan will go as intended. Follow-up is essential. Suggestions for monitoring progress: Make follow-up calls Call to check on progress and assess how the client is doing. Or ask the client or family member to contact you when they've carried out the tasks in the plan. Continue to assess suicide risk: Assess and monitor your client's risk of suicide on an ongoing basis. Things can improve or deteriorate rapidly. Return to discussions of means reduction as needed. Adapt plan Make any necessary changes to the plan if the client's situation changes. For instance, if a client moves out of their current home and in with a friend, the plan would need to be updated for the new living situation, and the friend would need to be collaboratively engaged in the plan. Encourage close supervision Encourage family, relatives, and friends to provide closer supervision since clients may struggle with their moods or have episodes of suicidal thoughts interspersed with stretches of feeling okay. Key Points: Collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means and enlist the support of family and friends. Agree on roles and timetable.
Document the plan in your notes and monitor progress. Continue to monitor the client's suicide risk as treatment continues. Update the plan to reduce means, as needed.

History and Ethical Principles: Introduction: The foundation of the federal regulations that govern the protection of human subjects in research can be found, in large part, in the ethical principles detailed in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>Belmont Report
The ethical principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. <br><a data-href="Respect for Persons" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/respect-for-persons" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Respect for Persons</a>:Respect for Persons
This principle includes two requirements: Acknowledge and treat individuals as autonomous. Protect those with limited autonomy. <br><a data-href="Beneficence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/beneficence" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Beneficence</a>:Beneficence
Two general rules reflect this principle: Do no harm. Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. <br><a data-href="Justice" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/justice" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice</a>:Justice
This principle requires researchers to: Treat people fairly. Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>. . Informed Consent: People have the right to expect that researchers will treat them as autonomous individuals, respecting their decisions about whether to take part in research and about what personal information they will or will not share with others. This is accomplished through a thorough informed consent process that is presented in a language understandable to the research subject. The Consent Process: The federal regulations about informed consent list elements of information that the researcher must provide to subjects. The regulations divide the elements into two categories. One category includes basic elements to be provided to all subjects. The second set includes elements that must be provided, when appropriate. Consent should begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a subject in understanding the research, what is expected of them, and the potential risks of harm and benefits. Regulations require that this information be understandable to the subject and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. The emphasis on subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) comprehension and presenting information that a 'reasonable person' would want to have in order to make an informed decision to participate, and providing an opportunity to discuss. This 'key information' is not defined in the regulation, but examples of key information were provided in the preamble to the revised Common Rule: The fact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary. The purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective subject's participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research.

It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness in non-global-directed activity).
Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition. Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndrome level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis. Note: Criteria 1-4 constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&nbsp;is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through adolescence and into adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity (over-activity). Based on data from the NSCH, the median age for onset for children with current ADHD was 6 years. More severe cases of ADHD in children, as described by parents, were diagnosed earlier. The median age of diagnosis for severe ADHD was 4 years. The median age of diagnosis for moderate ADHD was 6 years.
The median age of diagnosis for mild ADHD was 7 years. Approximately one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. Medication can be used to effectively treat ADHD symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity, and is the single most effective treatment for reducing ADHD symptoms.
Figure 2 is based on data from the NSCH and shows medication use among children with ADHD in 2011. An estimated 69.3% of children with a current diagnosis of ADHD received medication for ADHD.
Medication use increased 4% overall from 2007 to 2011, particularly among male teens.

Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts in mood and energy levels are more severe than the normal ups and downs that are experienced by everyone. Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older. An estimated 2.8% of U.S. adults had bipolar disorder in the past year.
Past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among adults was similar for males (2.9%) and females (2.8%). An estimated 4.4% of U.S. adults experience bipolar disorder at some time in their lives.

The signs and symptoms of SAD include those associated with depression as well as disorder-specific symptoms that differ for winter-pattern versus summer-pattern SAD.
Symptoms of depression can include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks
Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
Feelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
Decreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
Changes in sleep or appetite or unplanned weight changes
Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment
Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts For winter-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Oversleeping (hypersomnia)
Overeating, particularly with a craving for carbohydrates, leading to weight gain
Social withdrawal (feeling like “hibernating”) For summer-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
Poor appetite, leading to weight loss
Restlessness and agitation
Anxiety
Violent or aggressive behavior Winter-pattern SAD should not be confused with “holiday blues”—feelings of sadness or anxiety brought on by stresses at certain times of the year. The depression associated with SAD is related to changes in daylight hours, not the calendar, so stresses associated with the holidays or predictable seasonal changes in work or school schedules, family visits, and so forth are not the same as SAD. To be diagnosed with SAD, a person must meet the following criteria: They have the symptoms of depression or the more specific symptoms of winter- or summer-pattern SAD listed above.
Their depressive episodes occur during specific seasons (winter or summer) for at least 2 consecutive years. However, not all people with SAD experience symptoms every year.
Their depressive episodes during the specific season are more frequent than depressive episodes experienced at other times of the year. It is estimated that millions of Americans experience SAD, although many may not know they have this common disorder. In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.
SAD occurs much more often in women than in men. Winter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-pattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people living farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in the winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England are more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida.
SAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves repeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes (less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I disorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other mental disorders, such as <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Eating Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eating Disorders</a>, <a data-href="Anxiety Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety Disorders</a>, or <a data-href="Panic Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Panic Disorder</a>. <br>SAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common in people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, such as <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. Researchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most research to date has investigated potential causes of winter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier to study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern SAD, and more research is needed.
Studies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-pattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also suggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help maintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may prevent these molecules from functioning properly, contributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.
Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in people with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is believed to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin D consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the winter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, further reducing serotonin activity.
Other studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to altered levels of melatonin—a hormone important for maintaining the normal sleep−wake cycle. People with winter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can increase sleepiness and lead to oversleeping.
In contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have reduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days worsening sleep quality and leading to depression symptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high temperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, these theories have not been systematically tested.
Both serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body’s daily rhythm tied to the seasonal night−day cycle. In people with SAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal daily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to seasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and behavior changes.
Negative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer and its associated limitations and stresses are also common among people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, however, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the mood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment. Treatments are available to help people with SAD. They fall into four main categories that can be used alone or in combination: Light therapy
Psychotherapy
Antidepressant medication
Vitamin D Light therapy and vitamin D are treatments for winter-pattern SAD, whereas psychotherapy and antidepressants are used to treat depression in general, including winter- and summer-pattern SAD. There are no treatments specific to summer-pattern SAD. Since the 1980s, light therapy has been a mainstay for treating winter-pattern SAD. It aims to expose people with SAD to a bright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in darker months.
For this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright light box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30−45 minutes, usually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light box, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor light, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making this a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain eye diseases or people taking certain medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative treatments or use light therapy under medical supervision. Psychotherapy can help people with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that contribute to depression.
<br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a type of psychotherapy aimed at helping people learn to challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive and anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with SAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in two weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing negative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts about the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with more positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called behavioral activation, which helps people identify and schedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to offset the loss of interest they typically experience in the winter or summer.
When researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light therapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving SAD symptoms—although some symptoms got better slightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a long-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters found that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer. Medications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can be effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with talk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress.&nbsp;
Antidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work. Problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may need to try several medications to find the one that works best.
Because SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with disturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly enhance a person’s mood.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release form designed to last longer in the body. For many people, bupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive episodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring. Because many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. However, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD have produced mixed results, with some studies indicating that it is as effective as light therapy and other studies finding no effect. Because the onset of SAD is so predictable, people with a history of the disorder might benefit from starting the treatments mentioned above before the fall (for winter-pattern SAD) or spring (for summer-pattern SAD) to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms. To date, few studies have investigated whether SAD can be prevented.

Perinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. In rare cases, the symptoms are severe enough that the health of the mother and baby may be at risk. Perinatal depression can be treated. This brochure describes the signs and symptoms of perinatal depression and how you or a loved one can get help. Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The word “perinatal” refers to the time before and after the birth of a child. Perinatal depression includes depression that begins during pregnancy (called prenatal depression) and depression that begins after the baby is born (called postpartum depression). Mothers with perinatal depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that may make it difficult for them to carry out daily tasks, including caring for themselves or others. The “baby blues” is a term used to describe mild mood changes and feelings of worry, unhappiness, and exhaustion that many women sometimes experience in the first 2 weeks after having a baby. Babies require around-the-clock care, so it’s normal for mothers to feel tired or overwhelmed sometimes. If mood changes and feelings of anxiety or unhappiness are severe, or if they last longer than 2 weeks, a woman may have postpartum depression. Women with postpartum depression generally will not feel better unless they receive treatment. Perinatal depression is a real medical illness and can affect any mother—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Women are not to blame or at fault for having perinatal depression: it is not brought on by anything a mother has or has not done. Perinatal depression does not have a single cause. Research suggests that perinatal depression is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Life stress (for example, demands at work or experiences of past trauma), the physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby, and changes in hormones that occur during and after pregnancy can contribute to the development of perinatal depression. In addition, women are at greater risk for developing perinatal depression if they have a personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder or if they have experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mental illness that occurs after childbirth. PP is a medical emergency, and it is important to seek help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Women who have PP can have delusions (thoughts or beliefs that are not true), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling things that are not there), mania (a high, elated mood that often seems out of touch with reality), paranoia, and confusion. Women who have PP also may be at risk for harming themselves or their child and should receive help as soon as possible. Recovery is possible with professional help. Some women may experience a few symptoms of perinatal depression; others may experience several symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of perinatal depression include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
Irritability
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
Fatigue or abnormal decrease in energy
Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
Difficulty sleeping (even when the baby is sleeping), awakening early in the morning, or oversleeping
Abnormal appetite, weight changes, or both
Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause or do not ease even with treatment
Trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with the new baby
Persistent doubts about the ability to care for the new baby
Thoughts about death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby Treatment for perinatal depression is important for the health of both the mother and the baby, as perinatal depression can have serious health effects on both. With proper treatment, most women feel better and their symptoms improve.
Treatment for perinatal depression often includes therapy, medications, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may be an option to explore. Several types of psychotherapy can help women with perinatal depression. Two examples of evidence-based approaches that have been used to treat perinatal depression include <a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> and interpersonal therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help people with depression and anxiety. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations. People learn to challenge and change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior as a way of improving their depressive and anxious feelings and emotions. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar concerns. IPT is an evidence-based therapy that has been used to treat depression, including perinatal depression. It is based on the idea that interpersonal and life events impact mood and vice versa. The goal of IPT is to help people to improve their communication skills within relationships, to develop social support networks, and to develop realistic expectations that allow them to deal with crises or other issues that may be contributing to their depression. Women with perinatal depression are most commonly treated with antidepressants, which are medications used to treat depression. They may help improve the way the brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should notify their health care provider before starting antidepressants so their&nbsp;health care provider can work to minimize the baby’s exposure to the medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take antidepressants during pregnancy is very low; however, women should work with their&nbsp;health care provider to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and to find the best solution for their situation. Women may need to try several different medications before finding the one that improves their symptoms and has manageable side effects.
Antidepressants take time—usually 6 to 8 weeks—to work, and symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give medication a chance before deciding whether or not it works.
Do not stop taking antidepressants without the help of a health care provider. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. When a woman and her health care provider have decided it is time to stop the medication, the health care provider will help her to decrease the dose slowly and safely.
After the birth of a child, many women experience a drop in certain hormones, which can lead to feelings of depression. FDA has approved one medication, called brexanolone, specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. Administered in a hospital, this drug works to relieve depression by restoring the levels of these hormones. It is important to understand that depression is a medical condition that impacts the mother, the child, and the family. Spouses, partners, family members, and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of perinatal depression in a new mother. Treatment is central to recovery. Family members can encourage the mother to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.

Depression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.
To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.
There are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances. Includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities. (Also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder)
Consists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years. Depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression. Depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. A severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see). Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributed to another medical condition) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others 9 e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)
Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)
Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The episode is not attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria 1-3 represents a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a>, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion 1, which may resemble a depressive episode. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity.
In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: Major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. Specify if: With anxious distress (pg. 210-211)
With mixed features (pg. 211)
With melancholic features (pg. 211-212)
With atypical features (pg. 212)
With mood-congruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
With catatonia (pg. 213) [Coding Note: Use additional code F06.1]
With peripartum onset (pg. 213)
With seasonal pattern (applies to pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes) (pg. 214) Major depressive disorder is defined by the presence of at least one major depressive episode occurring in the absence of a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day, nearly every day (Criterion 1). The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes: Changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity
Decreased energy
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. To count toward a diagnosis of a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared with the individual's pre-episode status. The symptoms must occur nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation, which must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs to occur once. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly increased effort. The presenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest. The failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near delusional guilt.
The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps' (Criterion 1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, 'not caring anymore,' or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion 1.2)
Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations. In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion 1.3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion 1.3). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too ealry and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume)

Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>) <br>This diagnosis cannot coexist with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a>, or <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a>, though it can coexist with others, including <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Conduct Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/conduct-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Conduct Disorder</a>, and <a data-href="Substance Use Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/substance-use-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Substance Use Disorder</a> s. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. Chronic, severe, persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations: Temper outbursts: These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others).
They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion 3) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria 5 and 6). Chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion 4) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Consistent gender difference in prevalence have not been reported in population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance. The diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (6-18 years).
Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. A relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of: <br><a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>

<br><a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A family history may be a risk factor. Those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The same behavior deficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. Socioeconomic factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as post-conflict zones or communities affected by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and transitory. While irritability has a strong genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role. Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common. <br>Differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> and <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> requires particularly careful assessment. <br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> s in children involved longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child. During a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baselines. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. The irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder required severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. <br>In only approximately 15% of individuals with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. There is a more prominent mood component among individuals with mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. It should also be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood patterns. Children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. Children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual's mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice-weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. These two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. <br>The strongest overlap is with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. <br>If children have symptoms that meet criteria for <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a> and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Depression Disorder due to Another Medical Condition]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/depression-disorder-due-to-another-medical-condition.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Depression Disorder due to Another Medical Condition.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mood Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. But like people with anorexia, they often fear gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/bulimia-nervosa.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Eating Disorders/Bulimia Nervosa.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Binge Eating Disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Binge eating disorder&nbsp;is characterized by recurrent binge eating episodes during which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating. Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge eating episodes are not followed by purging, excessive exercise or fasting. As a result, people with binge eating disorder often are overweight or obese. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/binge-eating-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Eating Disorders/Binge Eating Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anorexia Nervosa]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Anorexia nervosa&nbsp;is characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health; a relentless pursuit of thinness; a distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight; and extremely disturbed eating behavior. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely malnourished. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).
A past year prevalence estimate for anorexia nervosa was not generated in the NCS-R sample of respondents.

Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person’s eating behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia nervosa. Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), median age of onset was 21 years-old for binge eating disorder and 18 years-old for both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Based on diagnostic interview data from the NCS-R, the data below indicate the past year prevalence of each type of eating disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&nbsp;can develop after exposure to a potentially traumatic event that is beyond a typical stressor. Events that may lead to PTSD include, but are not limited to, violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, combat, and other forms of violence. Exposure to events like these is common. About one half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but most do not develop PTSD. People who experience PTSD may have persistent, frightening thoughts and memories of the event(s), experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or may be easily startled. In severe forms, PTSD can significantly impair a person's ability to function at work, at home, and socially. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Anxiety Disorders/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panic Disorder]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Anxiety Disorders/Panic Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Start with a bowl of apples (or any fruit). Pass the bowl around and have each person take one item. Mindfully observe the piece of fruit for a few minutes. When the bell rings everyone puts the fruit back into the bowl and then see if each person can "recognize" their original fruit.
Instructions: First take your piece of fruit and weigh it up in your hands. Get a sense of the texture of the skin, the temperature, the weight, how it feels in the palm of your hand, how it feels as you run your fingertips across its surface. What do you notice here? Spend a few moments doing this.
Next, we are going to use our sense of smell to breathe in the scent of the fruit. What do you notice here? Try to stay with just sensing the fruit, perhaps notice if your mind begins to make associations.
Your mind will likely wander or begin thinking about things as you move through this exercise, so just notice make a note of these thoughts, and come back to paying full attention using your five senses.
Next, take a good look at the fruit. Noticing its visual qualities - color, shape, any irregularities, the stalk, surface texture. Just take it in - looking for details. Keep an eye out for any tendency to make comparisons or judge the fruit! You'd be surprised how often our mind rushes to judgements.
You could try next bringing the fruit up to your ear and listening to the sound it makes when you squeeze it or tap it. What sound does a fruit make? (I'll bet you never wondered that before!)
Next, take a few moments to feel your fruit. Noticing how it feels. Is it smooth? Is it rough?
Bring the practice to a close when you are ready.
When you are finished, it's good to reflect on the exercise... what did you notice? Was anything surprising? Where did your mind go? What do you miss when you are on autopilot? How might the skill of mindfulness and observing be helpful to you in your daily life? Under what circumstances might you use this skill? ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/observing-a-piece-of-fruit.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Observing a Piece of Fruit.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Therapist Activities]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This activity is to help identify the similarities and differences we may have. We want to honor and acknowledge those differences but also brings to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. This process might prove difficult or awkward. This is about getting to know each other and breaking down stereotypes. You can choose if and how you participate. This acticity is simple. Each one of us will read a statement. If the statement is something you have experienced, you cross the line. We will then reset and read the next statement. This exercise has to be done in complete silence.
The purpose of this exercise is to help students become more aware of the many types of diversity that exist and to find students who share the same experiences. For this exercise, students form a line across the classroom. Students are asked to step forward and then back into the line based on questions asked by the instructor. Start with questions that are non-threatening to get students comfortable with the exercise. Students can choose to “pass” if they want. Vary the questions to suit your group of students. Listening: Let’s have silence throughout the exercise – no talking, snickering, giggling, etc. Silence will allow all of us to participate fully. Silence will also enable us to experience our personal thoughts and feelings more deeply. Respect: It is imperative that we respect the dignity of each person who is here. Everything that is shared should remain confidential. Nothing that is offered should leave this room. Each statement will require you to make the decision crossing the line or not crossing the line. There are no right or wrong answers. NO PRESSURE. No one here is under any pressure to respond in any particular way to any of the questions. If you have any doubts about sharing some part of yourself, you should feel perfectly comfortable with your decision not to step forward.
What kind of feelings did you have as you participated?
How did you feel when there were fewer of you on one side of the room?
How did the movement of others influence you?
What did you learn through this activity that can make our group more welcoming. Walk across the line if your favorite color is blue. Look into the eyes of those you brought with you. Look at those you left behind. Allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling. Walk back across the line.
Questions: You prefer the city. You have visited another country. You have never flown. You know very little about your cultural heritage. You are the oldest in your family. You have lost someone you loved. You are from Ohio. You enjoy sports. You are an only child. You got picked on in school. Your parents divorced. You consider yourself a religious person. You prefer Coke to Pepsi.
You prefer vanilla to chocolate.
You have been in love
You have had surgery. You have lived in another state. You know someone who has been sexually assaulted. You have felt alone, unwelcomed, afraid. You knew someone who has attempted to die by suicide. You have cried at least once this year for someone or something other than yourself. You or someone you know is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. You have been a bystander to a racial, sexual, or cultural joke. You have read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. You did not cross the line in a previous statement when you should have. You are willing to understand, support, and celebrate diversity. If you have not crossed the line during this activity, cross it now. Here are some additional questions: Walk across the line if you have ever experienced a bad hair day.
Walk across the line if you are undecided about your major. Walk across the line if your parents are divorced. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is in a gang. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about lives in poverty. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about has been homeless. Walk across the line if you have been told or think you are fat. Walk across the line if someone you care about has been abused physically, psychologically, or sexually. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is dependent on alcohol or drugs.
Walk across the line if you know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Walk across the line if you know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDS. Walk across the line if you have been put down by someone else and it hurt you. Walk across the line if you put someone down and you knew it hurt them. At the conclusion of this exercise, ask students what they learned from it. The usual comment is that students are not aware that so many share the same experiences.

Ho was the last week? Highs? Lows? Accomplishments? Stressors?
Triggers: What emotional states have you experienced? What situations did you encounter that were difficult? How did you handle triggers? Address any significant changes in your life including in your living environment, employment, relationships, etc. Is there anything you would like to focus on today in group? Any questions or personal situations you would like to discuss with the group. It helps to talk about the things your group members are doing well first. Start with the positive before providing more challenging feedback. Empathy statements are helpful. Put yourself in the other person's shoes. Self-relating statements are also beneficial. Explain how you have had similar thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Some suggestions for how to start feedback include: "I really thought you did a good job talking about..."

What is your current emotional state? Do Frank Weber's emotions assignment. Color in the amount of each feeling inside you in this moment. Explain why you have that level of the emotion
Emotional Alphabet Activity Identify as many emotions as possible for each letter of the alphabet. Role-Play In groups of two, they are to create a scenario based on an emotion and role-play it for the group. They cannot actually state the emotion, or describe it in detail, but rather show the situation that elicits that emotion. The other group has to guess the emotion being displayed and explain how they saw that emotion (verbals and non-verbals)
Have clients select feeling words or emotion cards and act out that card. Have clients select feeling words and roleplay when they felt this way. Collage Cut out pictures that relate to emotions. Find as many emotions as possible. Label the emotion. Feelings Charades Write different emotions on cards, clients draw a card to select an emotion. She then acts out the emotion without using any words. The other clients guess the emotion based on the client's facial expressions and other non-verbal clues/cues. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/emotion-regulation/emotions-activities.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Emotion Regulation/Emotions Activities.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Emotional Awareness Lesson Plan]]></title><description><![CDATA[

What do you need from the group?
Process reactions to last week's start of group, check-in around how they are feeling today, any barriers to getting here? Review Treatment Plan Goals Complete Goals of Skills Training - General Handout 1 What are the client’s personal goals of behaviors to decrease?&nbsp;
What are the client’s personal goals of skills to increase?&nbsp; Administer the Weekly Progress Check-In Sheet (see sheet below)&nbsp; Review last week’s skill of “Mindfulness”&nbsp;&nbsp; Did anyone practice it? Was it helpful? If so, how? If not, what got in the way?&nbsp; As we move into today’s group and the introduction of new skills, here is some “food for thought” from Linehan:&nbsp;&nbsp; “This book is dedicated to all the clients of the world who think that no one is thinking of them. I considered telling you that I would practice skills for you, so you don’t have to practice them. But then I realized that if I did, you would not learn how to be skillful yourself. So, instead, I wish you skillful means, and I wish that you find these skills useful.”&nbsp; Facilitate Mindfulness Guessing Item Activity: Start by educating on mindfulness (observing, describing, participating, being non-judgmental, one-mindful, and effective). Explore how these aspects of mindfulness will be integrated into the activity. Put items into a bag. Go around the room, everyone closes their eyes except the describer. The describer describes the item you gave them starting with broad descriptions and moving into more specifics. I usually write on the board types of descriptions in case the person gets stuck such as the shape, purpose, feel, color, weight, size, texture, smell, taste, etc. As the describer begins describing the object, the rest of the group begins guessing what it is, until some gets it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Wise Mind Activity:&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding what is emotion mind, rational mind, and wise mind.&nbsp; Invite clients to draw what it looks like for you to be in rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Wise Mind Activity: [SKIP]&nbsp; Chain of commitments to wise mind: cut slips of paper, write or draw descriptions of wise mind, hand the chains in your room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise:&nbsp; Ask group members to identify one thing in their life right now that they know they need to accept. They can take a moment to identify that thing, write it down, and maybe even describe why they belief they need to accept it. Then they rate their level of acceptance on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 being no acceptance and 10 being full acceptance – if they have written it down, they are beyond a 0 which is positive).&nbsp;&nbsp; View Linehan introducing “Practicing Radical Acceptance”&nbsp; <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI" target="_self">https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI</a>&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding practicing acceptance.&nbsp; Introduce worksheets.&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise: [SKIP]&nbsp; Defining Myself Circle: Draw a large circle on a piece of paper. Ask clients to write or draw words that describe the ideal them inside the circle. Everything they are willing to accept about themselves. Outside of the circle draw what others have said about them that they do not believe to be true, the things they will not accept because it is not them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminder that there are two broad types of skills – practicing acceptance skills (for the things we cannot change) and change skills&nbsp; ACCEPTANCE SKILLS: Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance&nbsp; CHANGE SKILLS: Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness&nbsp; ACCEPTANCE + CHANGE&nbsp; WRAP UP, REACTIONS, AND TAKE AWAYS&nbsp; Process reactions to participating in group&nbsp; What was today like for you?&nbsp; Was anything surprising or new for you?&nbsp; What are you taking away?&nbsp; Videos&nbsp;<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI" target="_self">https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI</a>&nbsp;<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/rU7Knx3VByA" target="_self">https://youtu.be/rU7Knx3VByA</a>&nbsp; “You can’t teach something you don’t know yourself”&nbsp; Skill = changing behavior ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/curriculum/week-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Curriculum/Week 2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Week 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Title: Protective Factors for Adverse Childhood Experiences: The Role of Emotion Regulation and Attachment, Author: Tanner, Mackenzie A.; Francis, Sarah E.; Journal: Journal of Child and Family Studies, Year: 2025 DOI: 10.1007/s10826-024-02989-7
ISSN: 1062-1024, 1573-2843
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents’ development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n = 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difﬁculties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These ﬁndings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.

In 1896 on a hill overlooking what would become Mirror Lake, Ohio State's first astronomical observatory was build. It was named the McMillin Observatory after the New York banker who funded the project. He also provided the funds to beautify the area around the observatory, including Mirror Lake. At the time, the university had been considering laying a road through Mirror Lake, which was nothing more than a collection of interconnected bogs fed by an underground stream. \

A 'horiculture wagon' was pushed into the lake as a Halloween prank.

"To guard against trouble the street car authorities had heavy guards at the end of the Neil avenue line and on High street near the University. They were entirely unnecessary, no trouble whatever occurring." <br>Mirror Lake Islands:<img alt="1898 Mirror Lake.jpg" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/mirror-lake/1898-mirror-lake.jpg" target="_self"> First reference of freshmen being thrown into the lake.

Mirror Lake Bridge (Two Men on Bridge) (1915): Windstorm Damage (1918): Snow Scene:
But 1920 is when it seems the tradition became more serious with approval from student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step foot on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson Library. Only assigned enforcers, members of the Bucket and Dipper club, were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. 1922, the Lantern reported members of Bucket and Dipper would even defend freshmen from being dunked in the lake by those who were not permitted to do so, i.e. non-Bucket Dipper members. "Bucket and Dipper announces that no promiscuous 'ducking' or 'dipping' is to take place under the auspices of other organizations. Any attempt to haze freshmen in this manner by other organizations will result in Bucket and Dipper's strong-arm squad defending the freshmen."
The student council rejected alternatives to the dunking in Mirror Lake put forth by faculty members.
1922 was the last tug-of-war across Mirror Lake. University president said, "The University is trying to make the lake a place of as much beauty as possible." 1926: Freshmen got fed up with dunking into Mirror Lake and planned an event to burn the hats they were forced to wear. A huge fight ensued and police were called to the scene. Sophomore was hospitalized. 1929: "For all practical purposes, freshmen rules are already a thing of the past. Although several attempts have been made to revive the freshmen taboos, and particularly the cap-wearing tradition, the rules have been virtually non-existent since Bucket and Dipper was shorn of its power to enforce them." Mirror Lake Fountain (1931): 1942: Tug-of-war made another appearance for tradition week and stuck around for May week in following years. Ariel View (1947): Mirror Lake (1950s):
Last known reference of tug-of-war across the lake. In 1955, references to dunking popped back up in a Lantern editorial with the following reasons given for dunking: honorary initiates, fraternity seniors, pinned or engaged couples and any other willing soul. Mirror Lake facing North East (1961): 1964: An engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. 1967: Last reference of Bucket and Dipper initiating members by dunking them in Mirror Lake.

Literally, 'something for something,' an equal exchange or substitution.

Lederer &amp; Jackson proposed The Quid Pro Quo contract as an implicit contract that every relationship contains. It is a contract in which people exchange positive things with one another. They suggested this kind of reciprocity breaks down in relationships that are ailing, and trust becomes eroded. In 1977 Bernard Murstein found that quid-pro-quo way of thinking was characteristic of both ailing friendships and relationships. Once a partner becomes an emotional 'accountant' there is something wrong. (i.e., when the thinking is, "I did this for that person and it never got reciprocated,"), then that is a sign that the relationship is in trouble. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/quid-pro-quo.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Quid Pro Quo.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Psychoeducational Family Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

In other words, the moderator influences how, or under what conditions, the IV affects the DV. Helps determine under what conditions or for whom an effect holds true. Imagine you are studying the impact of a training program (IV) on job performance (DV). However, you hypothesize that this relationship differs based on work experience (moderator). For individuals with high work experience, the training might have a stronger (or weaker) effect on performance compared to those with low work experience. In this case, work experience moderates the effect of training on job performance. <br>When conducting moderation analysis (typically through <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a> with an interaction term).

Look for a straight-line relationship between each predictor and the DV. <br>Run your <a data-href="Regression Analysis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/regression/regression-analysis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Regression Analysis</a> Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear
In the Linear Regression dialog, click Plots. Move the standardized predicted values on the X box and standardized residuals to the Y box. Click Continue and then OK. Check the plot for a random scatter (no obvious patterns or curves) which supports the linearity assumption. The variance of residuals should be consistent across levels of the predictors. Use the same plot created for checking linearity. Look for a consistent spread of residuals across all predicted values (no funnel shape or systematic change in spread). You can also use tests like the Breusch-Pagan test in SPSS (via additional syntax or plugins) if a more formal assessment is needed. Residuals from the regression should be approximately normally distributed. After running your regression, save the standardized residuals. Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram and plot the residuals. The histogram should show a bell-shaped curve. In the regression dialog (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), Click Plots.
Add a Normal Q-Q plot by moving the standardized residuals to the Y box. A Q-Q plot where the points closely follow the diagonal line indicates that the residuals are normally distributed. <br>The observations should be independent of each other (i.e., no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>) Ensure that your data collection method supports the assumption of independence (e.g., participants are sampled independently) When running the regression (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), SPSS outputs the Durbin-Watson statistic.
A value around 2 suggests that the residuals are independent. Values deviating substantially from 2 indicate potential issues. Predictor variables (including the interaction term) should not be too highly correlated. <br>Ensure that variables are centered (or standardized) to reduce <a data-href="Multicollinearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multicollinearity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multicollinearity</a> when creating interaction terms. <br>Multiply the centered <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a> and <a data-href="Moderator" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/moderator.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Moderator</a>. Click Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS v
<br>Enter the IV, moderator, and the interaction term as <a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a> s. For moderation analysis, use Model 1. PROCESS automatically creates the interaction term (Training x Work Experience)
If your variables are continuous, it is often recommended to center them first (or use PROCESS options that center them automatically) IV and Moderator Coefficients: These represent the effect of the IV and moderator on the DV when the other variable is at its mean (if centered). Interaction Coefficient (IV × Moderator): Significance: A statistically significant interaction term (typically p &lt; .05) indicates that the effect of the IV on the DV changes depending on the level of the moderator.
Interpretation: If the coefficient is positive, as the moderator increases, the effect of the IV on the DV becomes stronger (or more positive); if negative, the effect weakens (or becomes more negative). Purpose: To determine how the IV-DV relationship varies at specific values of the moderator (e.g., at the mean, one standard deviation above, and one standard deviation below the mean).
Output: SPSS (via PROCESS) often provides these slopes along with their confidence intervals and p-values. Suppose you get the following (hypothetical) output:
IV (Training): b = 0.30, SE = 0.10, p = .003
Moderator (Work Experience): b = 0.20, SE = 0.08, p =.012
Interaction (Training × Work Experience): b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002 The significant interaction (p = .002) suggests that the effect of training on job performance depends on work experience.
A simple slopes analysis might reveal that for individuals with high work experience (e.g., +1 SD), the effect of training on performance is stronger (say, b=0.45b = 0.45b=0.45) compared to those with low work experience (e.g., -1 SD, b=0.15b = 0.15b=0.15). Below is an example of how you might report your findings in APA style:
A moderation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 1) to examine whether work experience moderated the relationship between training and job performance. The results indicated a significant interaction between training and work experience, b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002, suggesting that the effect of training on job performance varied as a function of work experience. Simple slopes analysis revealed that the relationship between training and job performance was stronger for participants with high work experience (b = 0.45, p &lt; .001) compared to those with low work experience (b = 0.15, p = .045). These findings indicate that work experience significantly moderates the relationship between training and job performance.

In other words, it is a variable that you control for to help isolate the effect of your main <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable(s)</a>. Covariates are used to adjust for variables that might confound the relationship between your main predictors and the outcome. For example, if you're studying the effect of a new teaching method on exam scores, you might include prior GPA as a covariate to account for baseline academic ability. By accounting for variability in the dependent variable that is due to covariates, you can reduce the error variance. This improves the precision of your estimates and increases the statistical power of your tests. Including covariates can help provide a clearer picture of the relationship between your primary variables of interest and the outcome, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. In analyses like ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance), covariates are used to adjust the means of the groups so that comparisons are made at a common level of the covariate. Imagine you're evaluating the effectiveness of a training program (the primary independent variable) on job performance (the dependent variable). However, work experience (the covariate) might also affect job performance. By including work experience as a covariate, you control for its effect, allowing you to more accurately determine the impact of the training program on job performance.

An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" target="_self"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File
Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/Testing for Normality.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:33:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structural Equation Modeling]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Structural equation modeling Thumbnail" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Example_Structural_equation_model.svg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">

Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. <br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ≈ .487
This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA. Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
Recall 'ballpark' effect size: Weak (|r| ≥ .2) Weak (r2 ≥ .04 or 4%) Moderate (|r| ≥ .4) Moderate (r2 ≥ .16 or 16%) Strong (|r| ≥ .8) Strong (r2 ≥ .64 or 64%) ACES (Adverse Childhood Experiences) -&gt; Psychological symptoms

𝛽1: Slope (How much DV increases as IV increases by 1 unit) One statistician movie fan decided to use statistics to study the movie ratings in his favorite movie guide, Movie and Video Guide (1996), by Leonard Maltin. Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film. The statistician used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 100 movies rated by the Guide.

"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package." The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: β1 = 0
H1: β1 ≠ 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: ρ &gt; 0
H0: ρ2 = 0
H1: ρ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br><img alt="9.

AKA dependent t-test:
Dependent variable (DV): Scores being compared Measured on at least an interval level scale
Often used to compare post-score to pre-score Independent variable (IV): The treatment or intervention Typical research question: Is there a mean difference between the post-score and pre-score?
Also used to compare twins, couples, eyeballs, etc. 20 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy -&gt; Amount and severity of depressive symptoms

NR O1 (pre) X O2 (post) Nondirectional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly different from pre-score (µ1) H0: µ2 = µ1 vs. H1: µ2 ≠ µ1 Alternatively, in terms of mean difference: H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 The mean difference is the difference in pre- and post-scores, so a paired-sample t-test is identical to a one-sample t-test, testing the difference in scores against the hypothesized (test) value! Directional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (µ1). H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 Directional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (µ1): H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0 One Sample StatisticsOne-Sample Test
For negative emotion change (hypothesized to decrease), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = -2.393, p = .011. The mean difference is -0.20 (negative emotion decreased after watching the video). The 95% upper confidence limit -. 0585 below zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly smaller than 0).
For positive emotion change (hypothesized to increase), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The mean difference is 1.06 (positive emotion increased after watching the video). The 95% lower confidence limit .7809 above zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly greater than 0). tobs = d ÷ sd-bar or d ÷ (sd ÷ √n) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - µ0) (s ÷ √n)
Where is µ0? Given 𝛼 level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).
Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; 𝛼 (SPSS) 𝛼 level is usually .05 (95% confidence level) Nondirectional: 100 (1 - 𝛼)% CI: ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x (sd-bar ÷ √n) To test greater (significant increase in post-scores): 100 (1 - 𝛼)% LCL: - tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores): 100 (1 - 𝛼)% UCL: + tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS
IV (treatment, intervention) is usually not recorded as a variable in SPSS
Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. Paired Samples StatisticsPaired Samples CorrelationsPaired Samples Test
For negative emotion change: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n = .48742 ÷ √34 = .08359
tobs = d-bar ÷ sd = - .2000 ÷ .08359 = -2.393 For positive emotion change: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n = .95754 ÷ √34 = .16422
tobs = d-bar ÷ sd = 1.05882 ÷ .16422 = 6.448 Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to decrease (one-tailed test). H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = - .2000, SD sd = .48742, sd-bar = .08359
tobs = -2.393, df = 33, p = .011
Since the p-value (. 011) is smaller than the 𝛼 level (. 05), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' negative emotion significantly decreased after watching the cat videos. Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to increase (one-tailed test). H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 Mean difference d-bar = 1.05882, SD sd = .95754, sd-bar = .16422
tobs = 6.448, df = 33, p &lt; .001
Since the p-value is very small (&lt; .001), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' positive emotion significantly increased after watching the cat videos. Cohen's d = d-bar ÷ sd-bar Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test: d = ( - µ0) ÷ s Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ±0.2: Small effect
d = ±0.5: Medium effect
d = ±0.8: Large effect Paired Samples Effect Sizes
For negative emotion change, Cohen's d (- 0.410) suggests a small to medium effect. For positive emotion change, the effect size (d = 1.106) is quite large. The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The results from the pre-test (M = 13.5, SD = 2.4) and post-test (M = 16.2, SD = 2.7) memory task indicate that the presence of caffeine in the bloodstream resulted in an improvement in memory recall, t(19) = 3.1, p = .006. There was a significant increase in the volume of alcohol consumed in the week after the end of semester (M = 8.7, SD = 3.1) compared to the week before the end of semester (M = 3.2, SD = 1.5), t(52) = 4.8, p &lt; .001

If your t-test is one-tailed, you need to say so. It's preferred to report the exact p-value unless it's smaller than .001. You need to state your alpha level (usually .05) early in the results section. If your p-value is smaller than .001, it's conventional simply to state p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)
Remember to drop the leading 0 from the p-value. No need to provide a formula for observed t in your paper. Observations are from a random sample, and the scores are independent of each other. Dependent variable of interest is measured on at least an interval scale. Difference scores (d's) are normally distributed. Typically considered robust to violations of non-normality, especially for big sample (n &gt; 30)
If one of the samples is highly skewed (particularly for a one-tailed test), a lot of error will tend to be built into the difference scores. Other non-parametric analyses would be better alternatives. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/paired-t-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/Paired T-Test.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:31:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Values for the F statistic should all be positive. F = 1 means no mean difference because the between and within group variabilities would be the same. The higher your F, the greater change of it being significant (would mean there is a much higher variability between groups than you see within groups) Complete F Table Compare the calculated F-value against the F-crit value If F-value is greater than F-crit then you can say there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups. When looking at the F-crit table, the df between is horizontal and df within is vertical. Make a Decision Write up the F-values (i.e., F (1,10) = 41.227, p &lt; .001). A bar graph can be used to visually depict the differences as well. Example Language: "We conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine whether there was a mean difference of depression scores between subjects who were diagnosed with depression and who were not. The ANOVA results showed that there was a statistically significant mean difference between the two groups (F (1,22) = 117.42, p &lt; .001)." The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-4.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-4.png" target="_self">
Where µ = group mean and k = number of groups. If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which is that there are at least two group means that are statistically significantly different from each other. The one-way ANOVA is an Omnibus test statistic, and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test. It is used to test research questions and hypotheses where you want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single dependent variable. You are asking if there is a significant difference between the groups based on a single categorical independent variable with multiple levels. If you are dealing with individuals, you are likely to encounter this situation using two different types of study design: One study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then randomly split this group into three or more smaller groups (i.e., each participant is allocated to one, and only one, group). You then get each group to undertake different tests (or put them under different conditions) and measure the outcome/response on the same dependent variable. For example, a researcher wishes to know whether different pacing strategies affect the time to complete a marathon. The researcher randomly assigns a group of volunteers to either a group that (a) starts slow and then increases their speed, (b) starts fast and slows down or (c) runs at a steady pace throughout. The time to complete the marathon is the outcome (dependent) variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-5.png" target="_self"> A second study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then split them into groups based on some independent variable. Again, each individual will be assigned to one group only. This independent variable is sometimes called an attribute independent variable because you are splitting the group based on some attribute that they possess (e.g., their level of education; every individual has a level of education, even if it is 'none'). Each group is then measured on the same dependent variable having undergone the same task or condition (or none at all). For example, a researcher is interested in determining whether there are differences in leg strength between amateur, semi-professional and provessional rugby players. The force/strength measured on an isokinetic machine is the dependent variable. <br><img alt="Midterm 2-6.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-6.png" target="_self"> <br>Every time you conduct a t-test there is a chance that you will make a <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. This error is usually 5%. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of "making a mistake" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests. However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors. An ANOVA controls for these errors so that the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> remains at 5% and you can be more confident that any statistically significant result you find is not just running lots of tests. When you choose to analyze your data using a one-way ANOVA, part of the process involves checking to make sure that the data you want to analyze can actually be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a one-way ANOVA if your data "passes" six assumptions that are required for a one-way ANOVA to give you a valid result. <br>Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (<a data-href="Interval Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Interval Variable</a> and <a data-href="Ratio Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratio Variable</a>) (i.e., they are <a data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous Variable</a>; IQ score, exam scores, weight, etc).
The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group that is being compared in the one-way ANOVA (technically, it is the residuals that need to be normally distributed, but the results will be the same). <br>For example, if we were comparing three groups (e.g., amateur, semi-professional, and professional rugby players) on their leg strength, their leg strength values (<a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>) would have to be normally distributed for the amateur group of players, normally distributed for the semi-professionals and normally distributed for the professional player. You can test for normality in SPSS. <br><a data-href="Testing for Normality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Testing for Normality</a> There is homogeneity of variances. This means that the population variances in each group are equal. If you use SPSS Statistics, Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances is included in the output when you run a one-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics. <br><a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>. This is mostly a study design issue and, as such, you will need to determine whether you believe it is possible that your observations are not independent based on your study design. <br>Your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Typically, a one-way ANOVA is used when you have three or more categorical, independent groups, but it can be used for just two groups (but an <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> is more commonly used for two groups)
Example independent variables that meet this criterion include ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate, and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist) and so forth. <br>You should have <a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. For example, there must be different participants in each group with no participant being in more than one group. This is more of a study design issue than something you can test for. If your study fails this assumption, you will need to use another statistical test instead of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., a repeated measures design). There should be no significant outliers. Outliers are simply data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern (e.g., in a study of 100 students' IQ scores, where the mean score was 108 with only a small variation between students, one student had a score of 156, which is very unusual, and may even put her in the top 1% of IQ scores globally). The problem with outliers is that they can have a negative effect on the one-way ANOVA, reducing the validity of your results. <br>Your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. We talk about the one-way ANOVA only requiring approximately normal data because it is quite 'robust' to violations of normality, meaning that assumption can be a little violated and still provide valid results. You can test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which is easily tested for using SPSS Statistics. <br>There needs to be <a data-href="Homogeneity of Variances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/homogeneity-of-variances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homogeneity of Variances</a>. You can test this assumption in SPSS Statistics using Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If your data fails this assumption, you will need to not only carry out a Welch ANOVA instead of a one-way ANOVA, which you can do using SPSS Statistics, but also use a different post hoc test. <br>The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options: Transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed
Choose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality. There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated. Welch
Brown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you can run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most situations, it has been shown that the Welch test is the best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in SPSS. A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumptions to fail. Often, there is little you can do that offers a good solution to this problem. Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-Way ANOVA<br>

When the initial F-test indicates that significant differences exist between group means, contrasts are useful for determining which specific means are significantly different when you have specific hypotheses that you wish to test. Contrasts are decided before analyzing the data (i.e., priori). Contrasts break down the variance into component parts. They may involve using weights, non-orthogonal comparisons, standard contrasts, and polynomial contrasts (trend analysis).<br>

However, you will probably also want to report means ± <a data-href="Standard Deviation (SD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviation-(sd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Standard Deviation (SD)</a> s for your groups, as well as follow up a statistically significant result with a post hoc test. The general form of writing the result of a one-way ANOVA is as follow:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-7.png" target="_self">
You should not report the result as 'Significant difference,' but instead report it as 'statistically significant difference.' this is because your devision as to whether the result is significant or not should not be based solely on your statistical test. Report the result of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., 'There were no statistically significant differences between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 1.397, p = .15)'). Running a post hoc test is usually not warranted and should not be carried out. You need to report your results. You then need to follow-up the one-way ANOVA by running a post hoc test. You need to perform the same procedures as above, but add into your results section that this assumption was violated and you needed to run a Welch F test. ANOVA test tells you whether you have an overall difference between your groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups differed - post hoc tests do. Because post hoc tests are run to confirm where the differences occurred between groups, they should only be run when you have a shown an overall statistically significant difference in group means (i.e., a statistically significant one-way ANOVA result). Post hoc tests attempt to control the experiment-wise error rate (usually alpha = 0.05) in the same manner that the one-way ANOVA is used instead of multiple t-tests. Post hoc tests are termed a posteriori tests; that is, performed after the event (the event in this case being a study). There are a great number of different post hoc tests that you can use. However, you should only run one post hoc test - do not run multiple post hoc tests. For a one-way ANOVA, you will probably find that just two tests need to be considered. If your data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances, use Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. Note that if you use SPSS Statistics, Tukey's HSD test is simply referred to as 'Tukey' in the post post hoc multiple comparisons dialogue box. If your data did not meet the homogeneity fo variances assumption, you should consider running the Games Howell post hoc test. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/one-way-independent-anova.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Research Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis/One-Way Independent ANOVA.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:31:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/one-way-anova.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/one-way-anova.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Multivariate Model]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The simple model (i.e., mean-only model) is not very informative and has a lot of error.
- Y = 𝛽0 + 𝜀
Our model-building goal is to improve prediction and thereby reduce the error. To improve prediction and reduce error, we add a predictor variable (X) to the model. This enhanced model is the beginning of a 'predictive formula' that predicts individual outcome variable scores (Y) better than just predicting the mean. To use a bivariate regression model, identify two types of variables: <br><a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a>, or known variable (x)

The estimate of the population parameter, which we calculate using our sample data, is designated by the Arabic letter b. We can predict a person's score on an outcome (dependent) variable (Y-Hat) based on what we know about that person's score on a predictor (independent) variable (x). If variables x and y are related to each other, then adding x to our model improves prediction and produces less error (SSE) than the simple model generated. Here we have two competing models: You can use bivariate regression to answer the following questions about the pattern of data points and the significance of a linear equation: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?
Which equation of a straight line can best describe this pattern?
Are the predictions made from this equation significant? More questions using Bivariate Regression: What is the nature of the relation between x and y?
Is b statistically significant? What is the Confidence Interval for b. What is the effect size?
How is the y variance partitioned between explained and unexplained?
Do plots of residuals indicate violations of assumptions for bivariate linear regression? The error produced by Model C is the most error a parametric model can have. Thus, we often call this model as the simplest or null model.
<br>We call the sum of squared errors generated by Model C the <a data-href="Sum of Squares Total (SST)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares Total (SST)</a>.
We call the sum of squared errors by Model A SSEA. SST is almost always greater than SSEA. SST = SSEA + SSR Y-Hat = b0 + b1X Y-Hat: Predicted value of Y
b0: Intercept, the value of Y when X = 0. b1: Slope, the change in Y relative to the change in X. We actually never know the true population value of parameter β; we only estimate with our data. Yi = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1Xi + 𝜀i We will calculate b1 first. Determine b0 and using b1.

To estimate the error generated by this augmented model (SSEA) we need to Predict a score on Y for each subject. Find the difference between each subject's predicted and actual scores on Y. Square the differences. Add them up. Y = 10.268 - .776x + 𝜀 <br><img alt="3. Bivariate Regression-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/3.-bivariate-regression-3.png" target="_self"> It is difficult to judge is an error reduction of 64.383 is a lot or a little. To help us get a sense of how much error we reduced, we express this reduction in error as a percentage of the total error (SST).
The regression model explained .805 (80.5%, effect size) of the original SST in variable Y. <br><img alt="3.

Bivariate Regression-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/3.-bivariate-regression-5.png" target="_self"> For the simple mean-only model, 𝛽0, was a constant equal to the mean of Y. Since the mean of Y was 6, 𝛽0 = 6. The intercept, 𝛽0, is the predicted value of Y when X is zero. Thus, if X has no meaningful value of 0, the estimated intercept is not informative. Centering the predictor of X to its mean can generate a better estimate because then the estimated 𝛽0 is now the predictor value of Y when the predictor X is its mean. Think about the 1 st year college CPA as the outcome (Y) predicted by the SAT score (X).

Y = 10.268 - .776 X + 𝜀

This new regression equation shows the exact same relationship between Y and X' as we found for Y and X. If you calculate the error of this regression model, you will get the exact same SSEA Allows us to answer the following: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?

The&nbsp;Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)&nbsp;is a measure of <a data-href="multicollinearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multicollinearity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">multicollinearity</a> in <a data-href="regression analysis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/regression/regression-analysis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">regression analysis</a>.

VIF = 1&nbsp;→ No collinearity.
VIF between 1 and 5&nbsp;→ Moderate collinearity (acceptable).
VIF &gt; 10&nbsp;→ High collinearity (problematic, requires corrective action). A high VIF suggests that one independent variable is highly correlated with others, making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.
<br>You can calculate VIF in SPSS using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Linear Regression</a>:
Click&nbsp;Analyze&nbsp;→&nbsp;Regression&nbsp;→&nbsp;Linear.
Specify Variables: Move the dependent variable to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box.
Move the independent variables to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box. Enable Collinearity Diagnostics: Click&nbsp;Statistics.
Check&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tolerance/VIF.
Click&nbsp;Continue. Run the Analysis:&nbsp;Click&nbsp;OK. The&nbsp;Coefficients Table&nbsp;in SPSS will include two relevant columns: Tolerance: The proportion of variance in a predictor not explained by the other predictors (Tolerance = 1/VIF).
VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): The degree to which variance is inflated due to multicollinearity. If&nbsp;VIF &lt; 5, multicollinearity is not a major concern.
If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 5, review the correlation between predictors.
If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 10, severe multicollinearity exists, and corrective action (e.g., removing variables, combining correlated variables, or using Principal Component Analysis) may be needed. "A multiple regression was conducted to predict Y based on X1, X2, and X3. The VIF values were examined for multicollinearity, with all values below 5, indicating no severe multicollinearity concerns (X1 VIF = 1.18, X2 VIF = 3.12, X3 VIF = 11.11). However, X3 showed high collinearity (VIF &gt; 10), suggesting a need for further analysis or model revision."

A statistical procedure designed to assess whether differences in the means of two groups reflect differences in their respective populations or are simply due to chance. Non-directional (two-tailed): To test if mean where sample came from (µ) is significantly different from hypothesized mean (µ0). H0: µ = µ0 vs. H1: µ ≠ µ0 Alternatively in terms of mean difference: H0: µ - µ0 = 0 vs. H1: µ - µ0 ≠ 0 Directional (One-Tailed): H0: µ ≤ µ0 vs. H1: µ &gt; µ0
H0: µ ≥ µ0 vs. H1: µ &lt; µ0 Reject H0 if tobs = (x bar - µ0) ÷ (s ÷ √n) falls into the critical region (determined by tcrit given the df) Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-sample t-test Pick variable and enter the Test Value (µ0) SPSS reports p-values for both one-sided (directional) and two-sided (non-directional) tests. However, confidence interval (CI) of mean difference is only constructed for two-sided. <img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-3.png" target="_self"> Set up hypotheses based on the research question. Where does the sample/observed mean lie on the sampling distribution?
Given the confidence level 100 (1 - 𝜎)%, what is considered extreme evidence?
Compared to the critical value, is the sample mean extreme enough to be considered different from µ0? For one-sample t-test (population σ unknown), we use Cohen’s d to report effect size.
Cohen’s d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ s Recall Cohen’s d for one-sample z-test: d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ 𝜎 So, here sample SD (𝜎) is used to estimate 𝜎.
Notice, unlike z or t scores, effect sizes are not affected by sample size Size of Cohen's d (by convention): Small effect: d = ± 0.2 Medium effect: d = ± 0.5 Large effect: d = ± 0.8 SPSS reports both one-sided and two-sided p-values, but only two-sided CI is reported. To obtain one-sided upper or lower confidence limits, run a test doubling the 𝛼 (alpha) level This doe snot affect the p-values reported in the output. Say if you are conducting a directional test a 95% confidence level and want to see LCL or UCL, you can change the confidence interval percentage from 95% to 90% in Options. The lower end of reported 90% CI would be 95% LCL (Lower Control Limit), and the upper end of reported 90% CI would be 95% (Upper Control Limit). Any variation detected inside the control limits probably occurred by chance. On the other hand, variation outside of the control limits likely occurred due to special causes. The upper control limit (UCL) and the&nbsp;lower control limit&nbsp;(LCL) serve as boundaries for expected deviation in data.

The null hypothesis stated that WTP would not differ from the retail price. The alternative hypothesis stated that WTP would differ from the retail price.
Based on a random sample of 20 OSU students, there was a mean WTP of $181.9 and a standard deviation of $231.215. Then compared against the hypothesized mean of $899, the one-sample t-test was statistically significant, t(19) = -13.87, p &lt; .001, indicating WTP is significantly different from $899.
In addition, the effect size Cohen’s d was -3.101, generally interpreted as a large effect (Cohen, 1988), indicating that there is about 3 standard deviations difference between WTP and retail price, with the WTP lower than the retail price. <br><a data-href="7.

Paired-Sample T-Test</a> Nondirectional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly different from pre-score (µ1) H0: µ2 = µ1 vs. H1: µ2 ≠ µ1 Alternatively, in terms of mean difference: H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 The mean difference is the difference in pre- and post-scores, so a paired-sample t-test is identical to a one-sample t-test, testing the difference in scores against the hypothesized (test) value! Directional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (µ1). H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 Directional: Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (µ1): H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0 tobs = d ÷ sd-bar or d ÷ (sd ÷ √n) d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference: sd-bar = sd ÷ √n sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). n is the total number of pairs. Recall in one-sample t-test: tobs = ( - µ0) (s ÷ √n)
Where is µ0? Given 𝛼 level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).
Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; 𝛼 (SPSS) 𝛼 level is usually .05 (95% confidence level) Nondirectional: 100 (1 - 𝛼)% CI: ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x (sd-bar ÷ √n) To test greater (significant increase in post-scores): 100 (1 - 𝛼)% LCL: - tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores): 100 (1 - 𝛼)% UCL: + tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS
IV (treatment, intervention) is usually not recorded as a variable in SPSS
Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. Cohen's d = d-bar ÷ sd-bar Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test: d = ( - µ0) ÷ s Size of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ±0.2: Small effect
d = ±0.5: Medium effect
d = ±0.8: Large effect The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. Used for questions about whether the population standard mean (µ) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (µ0).
Non-directional (two-sided) or directional (one-sided)
Population standard deviation (𝜎) is unknown: estimated by sample standard deviation (s).
Assumptions: Observations come from a random sample, and subjects are independent of each other. Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30). <br><a data-href="P-Value" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/p-value.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">P-Value</a>

Sampling is the process of selecting a given number of units of analysis from a population. Although in social research these units are often individuals, they do not need to be but could be households, firms, countries, or whatever. Sampling is often based on randomness to ensure representativeness, although non-random sampling might be used in some circumstances. <a data-href="Access" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Access</a>

A statistical method analyzing the linear relationship between an interval level dependent variable and two or more independent variables. Predicts a continuous dependent variable using multiple independent variables.
Example:&nbsp;Predicting exam scores based on study hours and attendance. Analyze → Regression → Linear.
Move your&nbsp;dependent variable&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box and predictors to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box.
Click&nbsp;Statistics&nbsp;and select&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Durbin–Watson.
Click&nbsp;OK. Interpretation:&nbsp;R² = 0.61 indicates that 61% of the variance in exam scores is explained by the predictors. Interpretation:&nbsp;A significant F (p &lt; .001) indicates the model fits significantly better than one with no predictors. Interpretation:&nbsp;Both predictors are significant. VIF values are acceptable (&lt;10). The Durbin–Watson statistic (not shown here) should be near 2. "A multiple linear regression was conducted to predict exam scores from study hours and attendance. The overall model was significant, F(3,56) = 15.41, p &lt; .001, R² = 0.61. Study hours (β = 0.45, t(56) = 6.83, p &lt; .001) and attendance (β = -0.28, t(56) = -3.78, p = .002) were both significant predictors."

How to Check Plot residuals vs. Predicted values
Look for a random scatter.
In SPSS: Request Linear Regression Plots. Y &gt; ZPred
X &gt; Z Resid
If the scatterplot shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met. <br><img alt="Testing Homoscedasticity Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-homoscedasticity-example.png" target="_self"> Example Check if the spread of residuals is consistent across predicted house prices. Solution Apply transformations or use weighted least squares. An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <br><img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png" target="_self"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png" target="_self">
The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png" target="_self">
In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">
If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File

The statistical association between two variables measured at ordinal, interval or ratio level. Many different 'correlation co-efficients' are used as measures of association. We already know many ways to represent the association between two variables, both measured on at least an interval scale. Scatterplot
Covariance sxy = (∑i = 1n (x1 - x-bar)(yi - y-bar)) ÷ n - 1 (𝜎xy for population)
Pearson correlation coefficient rxy = (sxy) ÷ (sxsy) (𝜌xy for population) The correlation reflects the noisiness and direction of a linear relationship, but not the slope of that relationship, nor many aspects of non-linear relationships. <img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).webp" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).webp" target="_self">
To test whether the sample correlation between x and y is significantly different from zero (non-directional): H0: 𝜌 = 0 vs. H1: 𝜌 ≠ 0 Directional alternatives are also possible. Assumptions: Linearity: The Pearson correlation assumes that the relationship among x and y is a linear relationship. Independence: Units or cases are randomly sampled from the population. tobs = r√(n - 2) ÷ (1 - r2)
tcrit: Given the 𝛼 level, t distribution with degrees of freedom (df = n - 2)
Reject H0 if tobs &gt; tcrit (or for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit)
Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; 𝛼
APA Style Writing Template: A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the linear relationship between x and y. There was a (weak / moderate / strong negative / positive) correlation between x and y, r (df) = (p-value). Notice: No need to report t. Restricting the range of scores on one or both variables will reduce the strength of a correlation. If the size of the standard deviation for one variable is reduced, everything else being equal, then the size of correlations with other variables will also be reduced. In other words, we need sufficient variation for a relationship to be evidenced through the correlation coefficient value.
HS GPA and ACT example: The strength of correlation between GPA and ACT will be lessened if we only focus on the graduates with summa cum laude (weighted GPA 4.2 or above). Correlation means the variables are related in some way, but correlations alone should not be used to infer cause. A high correlation between x and y might be a result of: x causes y
y causes x
A third variable z is causing both x and y (or even more variables are involved). Causality is not easy to prove. Application of complex statistical methods is not evidence for causality!
Causation (x -&gt; y) can only be inferred (formalized by the 19 th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill) if: x proceeded y
x was related to y
We can find no other plausible alternative explanation for the effect on y other than x. 'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .2 (weak)
r = ± .4 (moderate)
r = ± .8 (strong)
It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .1 (weak)
r = ± .3 (moderate)
r = ± .5 (strong) Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. You will learn regression models with multiple predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), in more advanced stats classes. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. <br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
Square it: r2 = (. 698)2 ≈ .487
This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA. Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
Recall 'ballpark' effect size: Weak (|r| ≥ .2) Weak (r2 ≥ .04 or 4%) Moderate (|r| ≥ .4) Moderate (r2 ≥ .16 or 16%) Strong (|r| ≥ .8) Strong (r2 ≥ .64 or 64%) xi: IV data point for subject i
yi: DV data point for subject i
yi: Expected/predicted value for subject i (i.e., the regression line)

The slope is determined by the correlation between x and y with a scale of y per change in x. Analyze -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear
Define DV and IV (one IV for SLR)
Usually you'd already review descriptive statistics and correlations before running a regression, but you can also ask SPSS to report Descriptive in the Statistics option. Many other options are for MLR only. The default SPSS output has 3 sections: Model Summary (How much variance in DV is explained by the model)
ANOVA Table (Model significance)
Regression Coefficients (Equation for the regression line) Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts: What we can explain by the model (regression)
What we still cannot explain (error) Regression sum of squares (SSR)
Error Sum of Squares (SSE)
Total Sum of Squares (SSTO)
SSTO = SSR + SSE
SSR, SSE, and SSTO are available in the ANOVA table R2 indicates the proportion of variance in DV explained (accounted for) by the model, which can be considered the overall model fit. R2 = (SSR) ÷ (SSTO) = 1 - (SSE ÷ SSTO) = (Multiple R)2 In SLR, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation between x and y Multiple R is the correlation between yi and y-hati (always positive) In SLR, Multiple R = | rxy | Omnibus: Comprising several items
"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package." The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: β1 = 0
H1: β1 ≠ 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: ρ &gt; 0
H0: ρ2 = 0
H1: ρ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value. <br><a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>

A method of statistical inference named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English mathematician. The method involves working backwards from effect to cause, by estimating the conditional probability of a cause given that certain events have occurred.

Many statistical procedures depend on the assumption that modelling errors are independent of one other. In the xontext of time-series research designs where, for example, repeated observations are made of the same entity such as an individual or country, this assumption is often not met. Where this occurs the errors are said to be autocorrelated. <a data-href="Heteroscedasticity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/heteroscedasticity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Heteroscedasticity</a>

Culturally humble therapists rarely assume competence. Requires the therapist to engage in self-reflection and self-critique. Ability to express respect and lack of superiority even when cultural differences threatened to weaken alliance. Approach clients with respectful openness, and work collaboratively with clients to understand the unique intersection of clients' various aspects of identities. It is a disposition rather than a competency per se. "Culturally humble therapists not only strive to be effective but also cultivate a growing awareness that they are inevitably limited in their knowledge and understanding of a client's cultural background, which motivates them to interpersonally attune themselves to the client in a quest to understand the individual client's cultural background and experience."
Developed a measure of cultural humility from client's perspective, found that it was associated with alliance, and progress, added explained variance to alliance above and beyond cultural competence measure. Relational Ethics Perspective: Take responsibility for the way our communication shape others' understandings. Build relationships based on curiosity, openness, respect, and understanding of the mean making process. Participate in meaning making in ways that allow for creating inclusive positions. Understand how our positioning contributes to the creation of social reality. Transparently share our positions of power and their impact on moral decisions that are made, ideally collaboratively. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/ethics/ethics-and-cultural-awareness.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Ethics/Ethics and Cultural Awareness.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:25:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Worldview]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Any oppressive system has at its core the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. This idea gets elaborated in many ways - more intelligent, harder working, stronger, more capable, more noble, more deserving, more advanced, chosen, normal, superior, and so on. The dominant group holds this idea about itself. And, of course, the opposite qualities are attributed to the other group - stupid, lazy, weak, incompetent, worthless, less deserving, backward, abnormal, inferior, and so on. The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society - the laws, the legal system and police practice, the education system and schools, hiring policies, public policies, housing development, media images, political power, etc. When a woman makes two thirds of what a man makes in the same job, it is institutionalized sexism. When one out of every four African-American young men is currently in jail, on parole, or on probation, it is institutionalized racism. When psychiatric institutions and associations 'diagnose' transgender people as having a mental disorder, it is institutionalized gender oppression and transphobia. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. For example, if a policy unintentionally reinforces and creates new inequalities between privileged and non-privileged groups. The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close--the racist jokes, the stereotypes, the beatings and harassment, the threats, etc. Similarly, interpersonal sexism is what men do to women - the sexual abuse and harassment, the violence directed at women, the belittling or ignoring of women's thinking, the sexist jokes, etc. Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal. These kinds of oppressive attitudes and behaviors are backed up by the institutional arrangements. This helps to clarify the confusion around what some claim to be "reverse racism." People of color can have prejudices against and anger towards white people, or individual white people. They can act out those feelings in destructive and hurtful ways towards whites. But in almost every case, this acting out will be severely punished. The force of the police and the courts, or at least a gang of whites getting even, will come crashing down on those people of color. The individual prejudice of black people, for example, is not backed up by the legal system and prevailing white institutions. The oppressed group, therefore, does not have the power to enforce its prejudices, unlike the dominant group.
For example, the racist beating of Rodney King was carried out by the institutional force of the police, and upheld by the court system. This would not have happened if King had been white and the officers black. A simple definition of racism, as a system, is: RACISM = PREJUDICE + POWER. Therefore, with this definition of the systemic nature of racism, people of color cannot be racist. The same formula holds true for all forms of oppression. The dominant group has its mistreatment of the target group embedded in and backed up by society's institutions and other forms of power. The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change. Likewise, people who benefit the most from these systems internalize privilege. Privileged people involuntarily accept stereotypes and false assumptions about oppressed groups made by dominant culture. Internalized privilege includes acceptance of a belief in the inherent inferiority of the oppressed group as well as the inherent superiority or normalcy of one’s own privileged group. Internalized privilege creates an unearned sense of entitlement in members of the privileged group, and can be expressed as a denial of the existence of oppression and as paternalism. It should be clear that none of these four aspects of oppression can exist separately. As the diagram below suggests, each is completely mixed up with the others. It is crucial at see any oppression as a system. It should also be clear that trying to challenge oppression in any of the four aspects will affect the other three.

Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence.

This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda.

A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. While the 13th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries. We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community. We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/labor-acknowledgement.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Labor Acknowledgement.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kinesics]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change.

The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society - the laws, the legal system and police practice, the education system and schools, hiring policies, public policies, housing development, media images, political power, etc. When a woman makes two thirds of what a man makes in the same job, it is institutionalized sexism. When one out of every four African-American young men is currently in jail, on parole, or on probation, it is institutionalized racism. When psychiatric institutions and associations 'diagnose' transgender people as having a mental disorder, it is institutionalized gender oppression and transphobia. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. For example, if a policy unintentionally reinforces and creates new inequalities between privileged and non-privileged groups. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/institutional-oppression.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Institutional Oppression.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:24:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Internal Locus of Control]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Any oppressive system has at its core the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. This idea gets elaborated in many ways - more intelligent, harder working, stronger, more capable, more noble, more deserving, more advanced, chosen, normal, superior, and so on. The dominant group holds this idea about itself. And, of course, the opposite qualities are attributed to the other group - stupid, lazy, weak, incompetent, worthless, less deserving, backward, abnormal, inferior, and so on. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/ideological-oppression.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Ideological Oppression.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:23:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Identity Uncertainty]]></title><description><![CDATA[

A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/identity-politics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/Diversity/Identity Politics.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:23:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Identity Centrality]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The handbook used by health care professionals in the US and much of the world as the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders DSM contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders. It also provides a common language for researchers to study the criteria for potential future revisions and to aid in the development of medications and other interventions. Used universally with Guidelines for disorders
Not a 'perfect mirror of nature'
Imperfect because there is more to understand through research. Right now, it is a culmination of mental disorders, a dictionary used to communicate with administrators, clients, and clinicians. Provide a shared language among professionals and clients. Most up to date information to provide help and assistance
Clinical judgement, DSM is a 'part' of diagnosis. It must be used with clinical judgement. (What does 'clinical judgement' mean?)
We should not be using the DSM too rigidly, but providing the help our clients need. Problem: People who should take it least seriously is scientists. Cannot make the psychiatric progress clients need. 1840: Category 'insanity' first attempt to quantify and name psychiatric diagnoses 1844: APA published a predecessor of the DSM: A classification of institutionalized mental patients Early 1900's First description of schizophrenia by Emil Kraeplin 1917: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the insane, including 22 diagnoses. 1952: First DSM, 130 pages long, 106 disorders 1994: DSM-IV, 886 pages long, 297 disorders 2000: DSM-IV-TR, 943 pages long, 365 disorders 2013: DSM-5, 991 pages long, 157 disorders 2022: DSM-5-TR, 1050 pages long Standardizes billing and coding
Standardizes diagnoses and treatment
Guides research
Guides treatment Oversimplifies human behavior
Increases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis
Provides labels, which can be stigmatizing Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation
Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy Categorical: A categorical approach to assessment relied on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity.

Discernment counseling is a short-term process (one to five sessions) with the goal of greater clarity and confidence in the decision about a direction for the marriage, based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and each partner's contribution to the problems. It is not intended for cases in which one partner has made a final decision to divorce and simply wants a venue to convince their spouse to accept the decision. The immediate decision is whether to carve out a 6-month period of all-out effort in couples therapy to restore the marriage to health, with divorce off the table during that time. At the end of 6 months, they can reopen the decision about divorce on the basis of what they have learned about the prospect of successfully rebuilding their marriage. Therapy aims for improvement in the relationship (e.g., increased intimacy, decreased toxic conflict), whereas discernment counseling aims for clarity and confidence about a next step. The goal of discernment counseling is not to solve marriage problems but to see whether they can be solved.
There is no relationship homework for couples in discernment counseling, no teaching of skills during sessions, and no enactments of deeper ways to connect.
If clients ask for ways to manage their problems during discernment counseling, we use a 'restraint from change' approach by reminding them that relationship change should not be expected during discernment counseling. Path 1: The marraige as it has been: the status quo, neither divorce nor working in therapy to improve the relationship. Path 2: Separation or divorce Path 3: A 6-month commitment to couples therapy (and sometimes other forms of help, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, or individual therapy) with divorce off the table and with the possibility of putting divorce back on the table at the end of the 6 months. The idea behind path 3 is to move beyond amibalence about working on change and see whether it is possible to put the marriage into a place that would be good for both partners.
Path 3, as we emphasize repeatedly, involves each partner developing a personal agenda for change on the basis of a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and their role in the problems. An advantage of framing the immediate outcomes as paths is that it moves clients past the dichotomous choice between staying together or breaking-up. The therapist too can support the idea that something has to change - the marriage cannot continue as it has been. So sometimes the discernment process begins with agreements instead of disagreement - something has to change; the old ways of being married is no longer viable. Implicitly we are saying that divorce is not a failure in this process; it is simply one of the options to be explored in a serious way, even thought only one spouse is actively considering it. Sometimes it has taken years to build up the courage to put divorce on the table in a chronically distressed marriage. Path 3 avoids the 'in or out' conundrum by offering a provisional commitment to work hard on the relationship for a period, with divorce not an option for this period but something that can be revisited later if things do not change enough. Most of the work occurs in separate conversations with each spouse, with carefully orchestrated sharing of take-home messages from the individual conversations. The flow of the sessions goes this way: Time with the couple together
Meeting with one spouse alone (the other goes to the waiting room)
The other spouse returns and the first spouse summarizes key learning from the individual conversation Meeting with the second spouse alone
The second spouse shares learning from that conversation A check out with both spouses during which time the therapist shares reflections on the process thus far. The majority of the time is with each partner alone. Times when both parties are together in the room are carfully orchestrated to minimize demoralizing exchanges and to maximize the focus on what each is learning about themselves in the process, rather than what each wants the other to change. The individual conversations have both similar and different areas of focus for the leaning-in and leaning-out partners. Similar themes are helping each better understand the dynamics of the relationship (their relational dance), their individual contributions to the problems, and how these relational and personal issues could be addressed in couples therapy (and sometimes with other helping resources). In terms of different themes, the therapist helps the leaning-out spouse figure out which path to take on the basis of an exploration of the sources of the person’s pain and discouragement about the prospect of change. The focus is on making a decision that has integrity for one’s self and others on the basis of a deeper understanding of self and the marriage and how the problems could be addressed in couples therapy if that is the chosen direction. The limit of five sessions, although not immutable, creates an expectation of intense work within a limited time frame. Going on much longer also makes it difficult for the couple not to expect relationship change and for the therapist to not lapse into doing couple interventions.
We say one to five sessions and not five sessions because clients are asked each time about whether they want to do an additional session up to five. Some people are emotionally flat when their spouse is in the room and then liven up when our one-to-one time begins. A big part of this approach is helping clients see the difference between traditional marital therapy and discernment counseling and allowing them to indicate their willingness to engage in the process. We are interested in knowing exactly what the couple knows about discernment counseling. The clients must leave the conversation with an understanding that the goal for discernment counseling is to help them gain greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage. We pay specific attention to whether they are currently living together and the status of any legal proceedings associated with divorce. After collecting some basic information over the phone, we typically ask something such as, "Can you tell me a bit about your current situation and how do you think it might be helpful to your situation?" It is important that leaning-out partners feel heard and that they understand how this process is different from anything they have tried as a couple before. It is important to assess whether leaning-out partners have made a decision to divorce or are open to the work of discernment. The following questions can be helpful in determining this: "Would you say that you've made your decision about the future of your marriage or are you still seeking some level of clarity in this process?"
If they report that they have made a decision, you can ask about their level of confidence in the decision: "How confident are you that you're making the right decision?" For leaning-out partners who indicate they know they want a divorce and would like to use the session to 'break the news' to their partner, or for those who say they do not know how to tell their partner, you can inform them that this is not consistent with the goals of discernment counseling. You might respond in the following manner: "It may be that discernment counseling is not exactly a good fit for what you want to do. The goals of discernment counseling are to help people get a greater sense of clarity and confidence in their decision making about a direction for the future of their marriage based on a better understanding of what happened to the marriage to get it to the brink of divorce and each person's role in that. If you're hoping for a different outcome, like helping your spouse understand why you want a divorce, discernment counseling is not appropriate for your situation." Usually, the leaning-in partner makes it clear that they want to preserve the marriage, but if not, ask that question directly. If the leaning-in partner feels desperate to do anything to save their marriage, suggest that they purchase and begin reading Michele Weiner-Davis's (2002) book The Divorce Remedy. (They learn that they must first look at themselves and their own behavior before the marriage can get to a healthier place) "Her book is written specifically for people who have recently found out that their spouse is considering divorce. She gives some practical advice on how you can act toward your partner at this stage of the process. There are probably things you can be working on that will make the situation somewhat better without making your partner feel as though he or she is committing to working on the relationship. This approach may be your best option at the moment." We cannot emphasize enough the value of respecting client autonomy during this process. Never assume that both parties are equally interested in attending discernment counseling. Discernment counseling is a way of meeting both parties where they are and not privileging one person's agenda over the other. "It is really important that your spouse feel as though they have a choice in whether to come to discernment counseling. If he or she feels forced into it, it won't go well and will likely contribute to more estrangement from you on their part. " Never assume that because one spouse has told you about something that has been happening in the relationship, the other spouse knows about it. The intake conversation must be conducted one on one, without the person's partner or anyone else in the room. The person on the intake phone call has to be able to speak freely about their perspective on the problems they are having and the struggles they are experiencing making a decision regarding the future of their marriage. "Are you in a place that you can speak freely without interruptions?" If there is noise or other distractions, you may want to suggest a different time or place for the call. You also should ascertain whether the client has told their spouse about discernment counseling. "Have you discussed discernment counseling with your spouse? What do you think is his or her level of interest in participating? Does your spouse know that you and I are speaking today?" Avoid the temptation to speak to one partner right after the other for the sake of convenience. It is probably worth taking the time at the phone intake to ensure that no one is feeling forced into having this conversation. There is also benefit to suggesting that the first partner you speak with explain to their partner that they have spoken with a discernment counselor and that if the spouse is interested, they can e-mail or phone the counselor to set up an interview. In no case should you cold call the other partner, who may not be aware of the initial contact from the spouse. Consider using the following script as a guide to the initiator of the phone call: "It sounds like discernment counseling is appropriate for your situation according to what you've told me. The next step is for your partner and me to chat about their take on the situation and whether they are interested in discernment counseling. What might be a good idea for you is to tell your partner that we talked today, and point her to the website that describes discernment counseling. Further, you can tell them that if they are interested in doing this work, they can contact me directly and we can have a similar conversation to the one you and I just had. What is important here is that no one feels coerced to be part of this process. By putting the ball squarely in their court, they can demonstrate their willingness to do discernment counseling by initiating the call. " Respect the autonomy of each person to engage in this process at their own pace. The phone intake is to describe, in sufficient detail, the purpose, goals, and process of discernment counseling. "The goal of discernment is to help couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage based on a deeper understanding of the problems in the marriage and each person's contributions to them. "
"Discernment counseling is typically a brief counseling modality and could last anywhere between one and five sessions. There is no need to commit to all five sessions because each of you would only commit to attending one session at a time. "
"The format of the sessions consists of meeting as a couple with the counselor as well as having some time dedicated to one-on-one work with the counselor. After each one-on-one portion of the session, each partner will summarize what he or she is 'taking with them' from the time with the counselor and share it with the partner who was waiting outside the room. The first session is 2 hours, and subsequent sessions are an hour and a half each. "
"In discernment counseling, we discuss the paths that are before every couple on the brink of divorce. Path 1 we call the status quo path and represents your relationship continuing the way it current is. Path 2 represents the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the possible reconciliation path, in which the couple agrees to take divorce off the table for a 6-month period of couples therapy, and each one commits to work on the relationship to see whether they can get the relationship to a healthier place. These three paths frame the discussions we have in discernment counseling."
"Discernment counseling is different from typical marriage counseling. The goal is not to solve your problems but to help you decide whether to try to solve your problems or choose a different path. It's not about immediate change in your relationship but seeing what changes each of you might need to make in the future if you decide to work on yourselves and your marriage."
Finally, you can end this portion of the phone intake by asking how this process sounds to them and whether they are still interested on the basis of what you have discussed: "Does this sound like a process that might hold some value for you in your current situation?" We are mostly concerned with is whether one of the partners is feeling coerced to participate and whether participating in discernment counseling will put one of the partners at risk of IPV.
- "We want to make sure everyone who participates in discernment counseling does so voluntarily and that no one is put at risk. So I have a few questions that we ask everyone who contacts us for an appointment.
- Are you feeling pressured by your spouse to participate in this project? Yes / No.
- If yes, does the pressure seem coercive (for example, is it accompanied by threats with personal or legal ramifications)? Yes / No
- Have you or your spouse ever had an order of protection from a court? Yes / No
- If yes, who?
- My last questions are about what happens when you and your partner get into arguments or fights. Again, our goal is to make sure everyone is safe.
- Has your partner ever done something to you out of anger that has caused you physical pain, bruises, or bodily injury? Yes / No (If yes, get specifics)
- Do you ever feel afraid of your spouse? Yes / No
- If yes, are you in danger now? Yes / No
- If yes to either, I can help you talk to someone at an agency that can help you. Would you like me to give you that information? In an emergency, urge the person to call 911. Ask if you can call back to check on the person.
“Leaning In or Out Measure.png” could not be found. We strongly recommend a 2-hour block of time because of the amount of ground to be covered in the session. After both partners' perspectives are heard in response to a series of questions, the discernment counselor meets one-on-one with both members of the couple, and each briefly shares what he or she learned in the individual conversations. The session ends with the couple in the room together for a summary of the work that was done that day and any impressions the discernment counselor has to share. If both spouses agree, the second discernment counseling session is then scheduled. In this first meeting together, each person is asked to share their own and listen to the other’s views on how the relationship got to the point where divorce is a possibility, how they have tried to fix the problems they have identified, and how their children (if any) play a role in their decision making. They are also asked to provide a brief account of a time when things were going well in the relationship.

- Precontemplation:
- A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior; the person may be unaware that a problem exists
- Contemplation:
- The person becomes aware that there is a problem, but has made no commitment to change.
- Preparation:
- The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change)
- Action:
- The person is in active modification of behavior.
- Maintenance:
- Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional.
- Relapse:
- The person falls back into old patterns of behavior.
- Upward Spiral:
- Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/the-cycle-of-change.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/The Cycle of Change.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telehealth]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/telehealth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Telehealth.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stereotype]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stereotype.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Stereotype.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stages of Therapist Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-href="@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@pattersonessentialskillsfamily2018.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018</a>
Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, “self of the therapist” stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family. Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist’s ability to listen and attend to the client’s story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about “doing something” with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins. The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics. “I know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I’m stuck in the content.” Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
Therapists’ unresolved issues or “growth areas” can become impediments in therapy.
The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy. Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. Therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors. Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy. To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
You also need a strong social support network Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable Keep the “big picture” in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
Keep the following ‘reminders’ at hand:** Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stages-of-therapist-development.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Stages of Therapist Development.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Socioeconomic Status (SES)]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/socioeconomic-status-(ses).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Socioeconomic Status (SES).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:21:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Self-Concealment]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Responsible handing of secrets is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems. Secrets indirectly influence the couple system due to the consequences and symptoms of secrets. Literature on the disclosure of secrets in therapy is scarce. It is unethical for therapists to collude in keeping secrets. Through voluntary facilitated disclosure or referral therapists should avoid a double-bind while doing therapy with non-disclosed secrets. <a data-href="@butlerFacilitatedDisclosureClinical2009" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/ethics-(7770)/readings/3.-confidentiality-in-family-therapy/@butlerfacilitateddisclosureclinical2009.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@butlerFacilitatedDisclosureClinical2009</a>

The extent to which an intervention is implemented as intended. (pg. 1720)
Provides insight into why programs work or do not work. (pg. 1720)
There is a major caveat in previous effectiveness research with the absence of information on program integrity. It is often unknown to what extent programs are actually implemented as originally intended (i.e., program integrity). (pg. 1720) The absence of significant intervention effects can be explained either as a lack of effectiveness of the intervention itself, or as a failure to implement the intervention as originally intended. (pg. 1720) Based on the limited information on program integrity provided, there are differences with program implementation and integrity across studies. (pg. 1721)
Without documentation of program integrity it is impossible to determine whether significant, non-significant or ambiguous findings can be attributed to the theoretical model underly- ing the program, or to the implementation of the program.

A balanced therapeutic alliance is crucial for the success of couple therapy; the therapist does not accept the role of judge. If there is egregious or abusive behavior, the therapist takes a stand; violence is out of bounds and the principle of safety first is bedrock in any therapy. Nevertheless, even setting limits and identifying problematic behavior is done from a place of concern and compassion. The therapist maintains a stance of “multidirected partiality” partial to each partner, on each one’s side. When clients feel understood and affirmed, the therapist can challenge them. Multidirected partiality is not neutrality; the therapist cares about both partners, is partial to each. But the partiality is balanced. The couple therapy office must be a “shame-free, blame-free zone,” a safe environment for clients to explore their vulnerabilities and relational disappointments. It is crucial that clinicians be aware of their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies, and note when they get caught up in a vulnerability cycle with clients. Therapists need to address unfinished business with their own family of origin.

A mental disorder syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.
Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (i.e., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.

Earlier studies yield contrasting results on the effectiveness of EQUIP. (pg. 1720) Not effective in reducing cognitive distortions and improving moral judgement. (pg. 1720) Aims to teach antisocial youth to think and act responsibly. (pg. 1720)
EQUIP is implemented in all juvenile correctional facilities as part of a nationwide methodology. (pg. 1720)
EQUIP is designed to teach antisocial youth to think and act responsibly by combining a peer helping and skills-streaming approach. The peer helping approach of the EQUIP program is based on the <a data-href="Positive Peer Culture (PPC)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-peer-culture-(ppc).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Peer Culture (PPC)</a> This is a positive culture in which individuals feel responsible for each other and actually help one another. (pg. 1721) A peer helping approach alone is not sufficient to counter negative peer pressure, since antisocial youth often lack the skills necessary to adequately help each other. (pg. 1721) The EQUIP program therefore also targets three specific 'limitations' of antisocial youth: <br><a data-href="Cognitive Distortions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-distortions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive Distortions</a>: Described as 'inaccurate or rationalizing attitudes, thoughts, or beliefs concerning own or other's behavior.'

Popular stereotypical conceptions of Martian men and Venetian women (e.g., Gray, 1993)
Suggest the differences between men and women stem from innate biological or psychological attributes. Previous studies have suggested men are less able to tolerate sustained levels of physiological arousal than women. This also suggest men and women grow up in differing social worlds. (Holley et al., (2010))
(Smith et al., (2010)) Stable differences between men and women explain why wife-demand/husband-withdraw (WDHW) occurs more than husband-demand/wife-withdraw (HDWW) (Eldridge &amp; Christensen, 2002). Some scholars have proposed that women are socialized to be more oriented towards relationships than are men (Napier, 1978)

Partners in a couple, seeing the same moment in different ways, may engage in “dueling realities.”
Making room for multiple narratives and differences of perspective and opinion, and recognizing the right of each to their own experience, are key aspects of relational ethics. Mentalization is the awareness that others have their own ways of thinking and experiencing. The therapist offers “construal humility” as a model, noting that we all construe or make sense of our world, but there are multiple ways to look at most interactions. Making room for dual narratives rather than dueling narratives is a key skill of relational ethics in both couple and intergenerational relationships. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/construal-humility.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Glossary/CFT Keywords/Construal Humility.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:14:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Closed System]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This principle requires researchers to: Treat people fairly. Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research.

The accident was precipitated by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK-1000 reactor and operator errors. In particular, the RBMK reactor had an unstable design (a positive void coefficient), meaning a loss of coolant could accelerate the nuclear reaction, and its control rods had graphite tips that initially increased reactivity when inserted (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output could increase if cooling,other safety mechanisms have been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output%20could%20increase%20if%20cooling,other%20safety%20mechanisms%20have%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). During the test, operators disabled critical safety systems and drove the reactor to a low-power, unstable state. A sudden power surge ensued when they attempted an emergency shutdown, leading to massive energy buildup.<br>Moments later, a steam explosion blew apart the reactor core, followed by a second explosion (likely hydrogen or another steam blast) that demolished the reactor building and exposed the core to the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The blasts ignited fires, including a graphite fire in the reactor core, that burned for ten days. The underlying causes trace to poor safety culture and secrecy in the USSR at the time. An investigation later concluded that the accident was “the result of a flawed reactor design… operated with inadequately trained personnel,” exacerbated by Cold War isolation and lack of safety culture (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The April 1986 disaster at,lack of any safety culture" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20April%201986%20disaster%20at,lack%20of%20any%20safety%20culture" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In short, inherent reactor vulnerabilities and human mistakes combined to trigger the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.<br>The immediate human toll of Chernobyl was severe.

The nearby company town of Pripyat (population ~49,000) was not informed of the danger on the first day.

The sudden displacement and fear caused significant trauma among the population.Offsite, there were no immediate deaths, but radiation sickness symptoms did appear in some of the local populace soon after (e.g. headaches, metallic taste). Tens of millions across Europe were exposed to low levels of fallout (see environmental impact below), and children in affected areas were given iodine tablets in some regions to block radioactive iodine uptake. The psychological shock and confusion were immense – for Soviet citizens who were kept largely in the dark initially, and for neighboring countries alarmed by the drifting radiation.<br>The Chernobyl accident caused an unprecedented release of radioactive material into the environment. The initial explosion and subsequent fire ejected at least 5% of the reactor’s radioactive core into the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). A towering plume of radioactive gases and particles drifted with the winds for over a week. The most intense fallout blanketed areas close to the plant. A 4-6 km² pine forest immediately downwind was saturated with radiation; the trees literally died and turned rust-red within days, earning it the name the “Red Forest.” This 600-hectare patch of woodland absorbed lethal doses (up to ~100 Gray), killing the pines and many small animals in the area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Soviet crews later bulldozed and buried about a square mile of this forest to remove the highly contaminated biomass ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=down and buried about a,The Soviet nuclear power authorities" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=down%20and%20buried%20about%20a,The%20Soviet%20nuclear%20power%20authorities" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). In the worst-hit zones, animals also succumbed – for example, horses on an island 6 km away died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by extreme radioiodine exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Livestock had to be slaughtered and crops were ruined across large swathes of land. Water and soil near the site were severely contaminated; radiological “hot spots” (with dangerous levels of cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, etc.) dotted the map in northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.<br>The radioactive plume did not stop at the Soviet borders. Within two days, winds carried radionuclides into Eastern and Northern Europe. On April 28, sensors at the Forsmark nuclear plant in Sweden (over 1,000 km away) detected radiation, forcing an investigation that revealed the source was Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant%2C,rising radiation levels%2C but a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the%20Forsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%2C,rising%20radiation%20levels%2C%20but%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). As the cloud spread, rain-outs deposited contamination in patches across Europe. Notably, parts of Belarus (to the north) received heavy fallout, as did areas of Scandinavia, Poland, Austria, and the UK. In the United Kingdom, for example, radioactive cesium from Chernobyl fell on upland pastures; in the immediate aftermath, the government restricted the movement of some 4.2 million sheep across 9,700 farms to prevent tainted meat entering the food supply (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Some of these farm restrictions remained in place for decades (the last were lifted in 2012) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) – a testament to the persistent environmental impact. Across Europe, a wide range of foods (milk, leafy vegetables, wild game, mushrooms, etc.) had to be tested or discarded in 1986 due to fallout contamination.<br>In the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, the environment was badly scarred. The reactor fire belched radioactive iodine-131, cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium and other isotopes into the air (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). Iodine-131 (with an 8-day half-life) delivered high doses to the thyroids of grazing animals and children who drank local milk in the first weeks, causing later thyroid disorders. Heavier elements fell close to the plant, creating an extremely hazardous zone within ~10 km. The Pripyat River and Dnieper water basin were threatened by runoff; emergency crews dug up topsoil and built dams to prevent contaminants from spreading through waterways. Despite these efforts, ecological damage was acute: plants died, and some animal populations in high-dose areas crashed or stopped reproducing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The immediate environmental legacy of Chernobyl was a poisoned landscape – an estimated 77 kilograms of radioactive material were lofted into the atmosphere, traveling as far as 2,000 km away (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>), and leaving a footprint of contamination that would last for generations.<br>The Chernobyl disaster had significant immediate political repercussions, both domestically within the Soviet Union and internationally. In the USSR, the accident exposed the deep flaws in the Soviet government’s crisis management and secrecy. Initially, authorities were slow to admit the severity of the situation. Local evacuations were delayed and the broader public was not informed promptly. Only on April 28 – two days after the explosion, once Swedish monitors raised global alarm – did the Soviet government make a brief 20-second announcement on state TV acknowledging an accident at Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An investigative commission has been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An%20investigative%20commission%20has%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). This minimalist statement offered few details, reflecting the regime’s instinct to cover up bad news. Such lack of transparency put citizens at risk and angered neighboring countries. Gorbachev himself did not publicly address Chernobyl until May 14, 1986, more than three weeks later. The delay and initial secrecy eroded public trust. Soviet citizens in Ukraine and Belarus, seeing helicopters overhead and troops moving without clear explanation, felt a sense of betrayal that they were not immediately warned of the invisible danger.<br>Internationally, Chernobyl proved to be a public relations disaster for the Soviet Union. The USSR was criticized for its failure to promptly alert the world and for rejecting outside help initially. The incident strained relations with Western Europe – for example, Sweden, Finland, and others demanded explanations as radioactive clouds crossed their territories. The political fallout added pressure on Soviet leadership to be more open and cooperative. The disaster became a catalyst for Glasnost (openness): it demonstrated the deadly cost of government secrecy. Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that “the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl… even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union” five years later (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls The nuclear meltdown at,The commission was to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls%20The%20nuclear%20meltdown%20at,The%20commission%20was%20to" target="_self">VIEW: Turning point at Chernobyl — Mikhail S Gorbachev</a>). While historians debate the extent of Chernobyl’s role in the USSR’s dissolution, it undeniably undermined the credibility of Soviet authorities. The tragedy spurred newfound environmental activism and public questioning of nuclear safety in the Eastern Bloc. In summary, the immediate political consequence was a profound shock that forced the Soviet government to confront its own shortcomings, setting in motion changes that transcended the issue of nuclear power.<br>In the decades since 1986, extensive studies have been conducted on Chernobyl’s health impact. The most clear-cut long-term health effect has been a sharp increase in thyroid cancer cases among those who were children or adolescents in affected areas at the time of the accident. Radioactive iodine-131 released from the reactor accumulated in pastures and was ingested via milk; this led to an epidemic of thyroid disorders. By 2005, over 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported in exposed children/teens (notably in Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Fortunately, thyroid cancer is largely treatable – the vast majority of patients survived. As of 2011, 15 deaths had been attributed to these Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Aggressive screening and treatment campaigns in the 1990s saved many lives. Aside from thyroid issues, major epidemiological surveys have not conclusively linked the Chernobyl accident to a generalized increase in other cancers or health effects in the broader population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), “apart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In particular, studies have not found a definitive rise in leukemia, solid tumors, or birth defects that can be attributed to Chernobyl radiation exposure in the general population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>However, it is important to note that estimating long-term deaths is complex and subject to debate. Low-dose radiation effects are hard to tease out from normal cancer rates. Some scientific models project that over the lifetime of those exposed, Chernobyl’s fallout could cause a few thousand excess cancer deaths (for example, one projection suggested about 4,000 future cancer deaths among the higher-exposed groups in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are expected from other causes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are%20expected%20from%20other%20causes" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Other analyses, often using the linear no-threshold model, predict higher numbers – for instance, a 2006 report (TORCH) estimated 30,000 to 60,000 worldwide cancer deaths in the long run due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Anti-nuclear organizations have cited figures in the tens of thousands as well (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). These larger estimates are controversial and not universally accepted; they rely on statistical assumptions and include very low-dose regions where any effect would be too small to measure. The consensus of bodies like the WHO and UNSCEAR is that outside of thyroid cancers, Chernobyl’s long-term health impacts (while tragic on an individual level) have been limited in scope relative to initial fears (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Nonetheless, each of those statistics reflects personal tragedies and serious illnesses that have affected thousands of families.<br>Beyond physical health, the psychological and social effects have been profound. The disaster uprooted entire communities and created an enduring sense of fear. Studies have found elevated rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse among Chernobyl evacuees and residents of contaminated areas ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015%29" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). The term “radiophobia” has been used to describe the chronic fear of radiation exposure that many people carry, sometimes causing more harm (in stress and mental health) than the radiation itself. Being labeled a “Chernobyl victim” or “survivor” led to social stigma and hopelessness in some cases (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Populations in affected areas often reported worse self-assessed health than objective medical exams would indicate, due to perceived danger (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Thus, a major long-term impact of Chernobyl has been on mental health and community cohesion. The disaster also had inter-generational aspects: while studies (including a 2021 whole-genome study) have not found evidence of significant genetic mutations passed to children of survivors or liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1929 Chernobyl liquidators,generational genetic effects.[ 223" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1929%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,generational%20genetic%20effects.%5B%20223" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>), young people from the region have grown up under the shadow of Chernobyl’s legacy, which influences their social and economic opportunities.<br>In summary, nearly 39 years on, Chernobyl’s health legacy is a mixed picture. There have been thousands of thyroid cancers (largely survivable), and possibly some increase in other cancers and health issues among the most exposed, but no mass epidemic of radiation-induced disease outside those categories that can be unambiguously demonstrated (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The trauma and displacement caused by the disaster, however, left lasting scars on public health in the form of psychological distress and disrupted lives.Paradoxically, the long-term ecological effects of Chernobyl include both persistent environmental contamination and the revival of wildlife in the abandoned zone. In the immediate aftermath, Chernobyl created one of the most radioactive environments on the planet, devastating local ecosystems. Yet over time, as humans withdrew from the area, nature has shown a remarkable capacity to rebound in many respects.<br>On the negative side, the environment remains contaminated with long-lived radionuclides that will persist for decades or more. Isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life ~30 years) and strontium-90 (half-life ~29 years) still taint the soil and vegetation in the Exclusion Zone and beyond. In the worst hot spots (e.g. the Red Forest and near the reactor), soil and plant life are loaded with radionuclide levels that inhibit normal biological processes. Studies have found increased mutation rates in many organisms: one analysis showed plant and animal mutation rates in the Chernobyl region were up to 20 times higher than normal background levels (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). There is evidence of elevated mortality and reduced reproductive success in some species living in the most contaminated areas, consistent with radiation-induced genetic damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). For example, some birds in high-radiation zones have been observed to have smaller brain sizes or cataracts, and fewer insects (like bees, butterflies, spiders) are found in these areas in some studies. Trees in certain plots grow more slowly due to radionuclide uptake. Forest ecosystems have been altered: the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) in soil were initially impaired by radiation, leading to a thick layer of semi-decomposed leaf litter that persisted for years. Even today, wild boar in parts of Germany and Austria still show high cesium levels from eating Chernobyl-tainted mushrooms and soils (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported,lamb industry in Norway were" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Agricultural%20Authority%20reported,lamb%20industry%20in%20Norway%20were" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). And periodic wildfires in the Exclusion Zone can remobilize radionuclides, as burning plants release cesium and strontium back into the air – a concern that persists each fire season. Thus, ecologically, Chernobyl created a chronic environmental hazard in the contaminated regions: a “dirty” ecosystem where radioactive elements circulate and will slowly decay over generations.<br>On the other hand, the absence of human activity in the vast Exclusion Zone has allowed wildlife to flourish in unexpected ways. With 2,600 km² of land (in Ukraine) largely free from people, the area has become an unintended wildlife sanctuary. By the 2010s, biologists conducting long-term censuses observed that many large animal populations were thriving. A 2015 scientific study using animal track counts and camera traps found no evidence of reduced mammal abundance in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone compared to similar uncontaminated nature reserves – in fact, populations of elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves were as high or higher than in less disturbed reserves (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The study concluded that chronic radiation had not significantly affected these wildlife populations; instead, the removal of humans (and associated activities like farming, hunting, logging) allowed nature to rebound vigorously (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Subsequent research and observations have noted an increase in biodiversity: the Exclusion Zone now hosts species rarely seen in the region for decades prior. Wolves roam in large numbers (some estimates suggest the zone has one of the highest densities of wolves in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Lynx and Eurasian brown bears – species that were once extirpated locally – have been spotted within the zone. Endangered European bison have been reintroduced and are breeding. The Przewalski’s horse, a rare wild equine, was released into the zone in the 1990s and now herds of these horses graze the grasslands of Chernobyl. Moose, foxes, badgers, wild boar, deer, and dozens of bird species inhabit the forests and marshes. Even the Pripyat town itself and derelict buildings are used by wildlife (e.g. nesting birds, small mammals). In essence, in the long term, Chernobyl’s ecosystem has transformed into a unique experiment: a landscape of high radiation pockets but flourishing wildlife, illustrating the resilience of nature when freed from human pressures (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some scientists have termed it a “accidental wildlife reserve.” Photographic evidence and surveys by organizations like the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve (established by Ukraine in 2016) document robust ecosystems, though still affected by the residue of contamination.<br>It’s important to balance this picture: radiation is certainly not “good” for wildlife, and in highly contaminated spots the damage to organisms is real (for instance, smaller creatures with short lifespans show higher mutation impacts). Scientists continue to debate the extent of sublethal effects on Chernobyl’s wildlife – some studies find more genetic abnormalities or shorter lifespans in animals from radioactive hot spots, while others point to the abundant population numbers as a sign of adaptation or tolerance (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). The likely reality is that many species have been able to recover because the benefit of habitat free from humans outweighs the detriments of the radiation levels they experience (which for most of the zone are low to moderate now). The Chernobyl zone has thus become a living laboratory for studying chronic low-dose radiation on ecosystems, with ongoing research that will inform ecology and radiobiology for decades. From an ecological perspective, Chernobyl’s legacy is a landscape of contrasts: lingering contamination and altered biological processes, alongside a teeming revival of wildlife in what has become one of Europe’s largest rewilded areas.<br>The Chernobyl disaster’s ramifications extended into the geopolitical and policy realm, influencing nuclear energy policies and international cooperation. In the Soviet Union, as mentioned, Chernobyl was a catalyst for Glasnost and political reform. It forced Soviet leadership to cooperate more with international authorities – for example, in August 1986 (just months after the accident), the USSR sent a delegation to the IAEA in Vienna to openly present details of the accident to the world, a notable break from past secrecy ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were subsequently restarted but all,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were%20subsequently%20restarted%20but%20all,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Gorbachev’s policies of openness were reinforced by the recognition that hiding disasters was untenable. In the bigger picture, Chernobyl “led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The Chernobyl disaster was a,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20Chernobyl%20disaster%20was%20a,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some commentators even argue that the disaster contributed to the fall of the USSR by exposing its systemic problems and costing enormous resources – as noted earlier, Gorbachev later said Chernobyl was a more important factor in the Soviet collapse than his own reform efforts (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C particularly between East and,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C%20particularly%20between%20East%20and,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>On the international stage, nuclear safety was fundamentally re-examined. Chernobyl was the first nuclear accident to directly result in radiation fatalities (and remains one of only two Level 7 accidents, along with Fukushima 2011). This spurred a wave of new protocols and cooperation. Western and Soviet-bloc experts began collaborating to prevent another Chernobyl. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was established, linking operators from over 30 countries to share safety information and peer reviews (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since 1989%2C over 1000 nuclear,in the Nuclear Power Industry" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since%201989%2C%20over%201000%20nuclear,in%20the%20Nuclear%20Power%20Industry" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The IAEA implemented the Convention on Nuclear Safety (adopted in 1994), a treaty that committed nations to international nuclear plant inspections and higher safety standards (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Design changes were rapidly instituted for RBMK reactors – all remaining RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania, etc.) were retrofitted with safety upgrades: e.g. adding neutron absorbers, faster shut-down systems, and eliminating the positive void coefficient at low power (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications have been made to,see Post accident changes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications%20have%20been%20made%20to,see%20Post%20accident%20changes" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) so that a Chernobyl-type runaway reaction “is now virtually impossible” in those reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). International aid (through organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped finance these safety improvements and the eventual decommissioning of Chernobyl’s other reactors.<br>Public opinion toward nuclear energy also shifted significantly after Chernobyl, especially in Europe. The accident fueled anti-nuclear movements and policy reversals in several countries. For example, in Italy, Chernobyl triggered a national referendum in November 1987 in which over 80% of voters chose to abandon nuclear power; as a result, Italy shut down its existing reactors and scrapped plans for new ones (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C only the widespread popular,a question of individual conscience" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C%20only%20the%20widespread%20popular,a%20question%20of%20individual%20conscience" target="_self">Nuclear Power, No Thanks! The Aftermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the Nuclear Power Referendum of 1987 | Environment &amp; Society Portal</a>). In West Germany, large anti-nuclear protests took place, and although Germany did not immediately phase out nuclear (that came later), Chernobyl planted seeds of skepticism that eventually contributed to Germany’s decision to end nuclear power by 2022. Other countries like Austria (which had completed a nuclear plant but never fueled it, due to a referendum) felt vindicated. Even far from Europe, Chernobyl had an impact: nations such as the United States and UK reviewed their emergency preparedness; some countries paused or scaled back nuclear projects. The accident underscored that a nuclear disaster is not confined by borders, leading to improved international radiation monitoring networks and emergency response coordination (for instance, the EU created rapid notification systems for nuclear incidents).<br>Geopolitically, Chernobyl also imposed huge economic costs on the USSR (and later Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) – estimated hundreds of billions of dollars over time – contributing to economic stress. Belarus in particular, which received around 70% of the fallout, spent up to 25% of its national budget on Chernobyl consequences in the late 80s and 90s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In the aftermath of the,Ecology of the Chernobyl Catastrophe" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20the,Ecology%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Catastrophe" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More than 1,borne particles drifted to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More%20than%201,borne%20particles%20drifted%20to" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). This influenced those republics’ politics and relations; for example, arguments over how to pay for Chernobyl recovery were part of the rising tensions in the dissolving Soviet Union. In Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, Chernobyl left a legacy that shaped its environmental and energy policy – the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl (Unit 3) was only shut down in December 2000 as part of an agreement with Western countries that provided financial aid for safer energy projects ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).In summary, the long-term political and geopolitical impact of Chernobyl was far-reaching. It accelerated the end of the Soviet era, prompted a global reckoning on nuclear safety, fostered East-West scientific cooperation, and strengthened international regulatory frameworks. It also invigorated citizen movements and influenced national policies on energy. The world’s nuclear industry after 1986 underwent significant reforms in training, reactor design, risk communication, and emergency planning, all under the shadow of lessons learned from Chernobyl.<br>Right after the explosions, an urgent priority was to extinguish the fires and contain the damage at the power plant. In the early hours of April 26, plant workers and local firefighters rushed to the scene with no full knowledge of the radiation hazard. A fire raged on the roof of Unit 3 (adjacent to the destroyed Unit 4) as well as throughout the wreckage of Unit 4. Fire brigades worked feverishly to douse the flames and keep them from spreading to other reactor buildings. By 5:00 AM, most of the external fires (on the roof and around the building) were extinguished, thanks to these responders – many of whom absorbed massive radiation doses in the process (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). However, inside Reactor 4, the graphite core fire was burning like a giant ember, uncontrollably spewing radiation. It continued to burn for ten days, not fully going out until May 6, 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) when there was no more material left to burn.<br>To combat the reactor fire, the Soviet authorities initiated unprecedented measures. Within 24 hours, the military organized helicopter drops to smother the exposed core. Pilots flew directly over the glowing reactor, dumping load after load of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron into the inferno. In total, more than 5,000 tonnes of these materials were dropped from the air in the weeks after the accident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). It was an incredibly dangerous mission – roughly 600 Soviet helicopter pilots and crew participated, many receiving high radiation doses as they hovered above the destroyed reactor (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The intent was to choke the fire and absorb neutrons to prevent any renewed nuclear chain reaction. (Later analysis suggests much of the dropped material did not stay in the core but the effort likely helped cool and bury the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).) Firefighters also pumped water into the reactor ruins until fears of a steam explosion in the basement halted that approach. Additionally, teams of engineers drained and vented the plant’s steam suppression pools under the reactor (the “bubbler” pools) to remove water and prevent a potential secondary steam explosion that could have ejected even more radioactivity. This harrowing drain operation required three men to enter radioactive flooded corridors – an oft-cited act of bravery (they survived due to quick work and later medical care).<br>Once the immediate crisis of fire and potential further explosions was under control, the focus shifted to cleaning up the massive radioactive mess – a task that would take years. The Soviet Union marshaled an enormous workforce for this, later known as the “liquidators.” These were civil and military personnel conscripted to liquidate (eliminate) the consequences of the accident. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 600,000 people from all over the USSR were officially recognized as Chernobyl liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). They included firefighters, soldiers, engineers, technicians, miners, medical staff, and even volunteers. In 1986–87 alone, about 240,000 recovery workers were on site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). Many were young conscripts in the Soviet Army sent to do manual decontamination work.<br>The liquidators’ tasks were varied and often perilous. In the immediate aftermath, one critical job was to clear the highly radioactive debris from the roof of Unit 3 and the surroundings of Unit 4. Chunks of graphite core and reactor fuel had been hurled onto the rooftops and ground. Radiation on the roof was so intense (up to 10,000 R/hour in some spots) that even 1-2 minutes of exposure could deliver a dangerous dose (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Remote-controlled robots were attempted to shovel debris, but most failed quickly due to the radiation frying their electronics. Thus, human soldiers – dubbed “bio-robots” – had to do it. Working in shifts of only about 40 to 90 seconds each, men sprinted onto the roof, shoveled a few scoops of debris over the edge, and ran back, never to return to that spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1173 Chernobyl liquidators,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1173%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl liquidators from the military%2C,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl%20liquidators%20from%20the%20military%2C,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Each did only one or two trips. By this method, the rooftops were cleared enough to allow construction of the shelter later.<br>Other liquidator crews decontaminated the ground: they used bulldozers and hand tools to scrape up topsoil, which was radioactive, and buried it in trenches. They washed down buildings, roads, and even livestock to remove fallout. A special substance called “Barda” (a sticky resin) was sprayed over large areas by trucks and helicopters to trap radioactive dust and prevent it from re-aerosolizing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters regularly sprayed large areas,2018%2C parked in a field" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters%20regularly%20sprayed%20large%20areas,2018%2C%20parked%20in%20a%20field" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). In Pripyat and other evacuated towns, teams went house to house to collect and dispose of irradiated belongings and to euthanize abandoned pets and livestock (to prevent them from spreading contamination). Miners were brought in to tunnel underneath the reactor; they excavated a cavity and poured concrete to create a cooling slab under the smoldering core (“corium”) lava, to prevent it from melting through to groundwater – this prevented a potential groundwater contamination catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of trees were cut down. Contaminated vehicles, helicopters, and equipment were taken out of service – many were buried or dumped in a vehicle graveyard in the Zone (some remain there to this day, rusting and still radioactive (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The official contaminated zones saw,up effort lasting seven" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20official%20contaminated%20zones%20saw,up%20effort%20lasting%20seven" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>)).<br>The liquidators often worked under harsh, hasty conditions with inconsistent protection. Early on, many were not fully informed of the risks. They wore simple cotton jumpsuits or ill-fitting lead aprons and rudimentary respirators, if anything. As time went on, safety measures improved somewhat, but thousands of liquidators exceeded recommended radiation doses (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1258 ,99" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1258%20,99" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The average dose for the ~600k liquidators is estimated at about 120 mSv (12 rem) per person (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>), which is significant (roughly 50 times a typical yearly background dose). Some individuals, particularly those in 1986 roof and core cleanup, received much higher doses (several Sieverts in a few cases). Many liquidators later suffered health issues, and they are honored today for their sacrifice. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus commemorate Liquidators’ Day (often on December 14, the date in 1986 when the reactor was declared sealed) to remember their contributions. These efforts by the liquidators were crucial in reducing the ongoing risk from Chernobyl – they mitigated what could have been a far worse environmental outcome by working to contain and confine the radioactive materials.<br>A monumental engineering task in 1986 was to entomb the destroyed Reactor 4 to stop further radiation release. Immediately after the accident, Reactor No.4 was an open wound spewing radioactivity, so the Soviet government undertook the construction of a massive containment structure known colloquially as the “sarcophagus.” Design work began just weeks after the accident, and construction started in June 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Despite the extreme conditions, within 206 days – by late November 1986 – the sarcophagus was completed and put in place over Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June 1986 Completed November 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June%201986%20Completed%20November%201986" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The design of the sarcophagus,The seams of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The%20design%20of%20the%20sarcophagus,The%20seams%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). (Some sources cite completion in November, others in early December, but essentially seven months after the disaster.)<br>The sarcophagus was essentially a hastily built steel and concrete shield, erected around the ruins to contain the radiation. It was enormous – over 50 meters tall – and had to be assembled largely by machines and remote welders because radiation levels near the core were deadly. Engineers improvised, often working by remote control or from cranes, to bolt together steel panels and pour concrete over the reactor building’s remains. By its completion, the “Object Ukrytie” (Object Shelter, the official name) encased about 200 tons of radioactive corium (lava-like melted core fuel), plus an estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and debris inside the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building of the Chernobyl Nuclear,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Nuclear,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive contamination of the,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive%20contamination%20%20of%20the,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). This ad-hoc containment prevented these materials from directly escaping to the environment. The sarcophagus also incorporated ventilation to prevent heat and gas buildup, and it sealed off the reactor from rain, which would otherwise leach radioactivity into the ground.<br>Structurally, the sarcophagus was supported in part by the ruined walls of Reactor 4 and was not hermetically tight, but it dramatically reduced radiation emissions from the site. By late 1986, radiation levels around the plant had dropped significantly due to the containment and natural decay of short-lived isotopes. This allowed the other reactors at Chernobyl (Units 1, 2, and 3), which had been shut down after the accident, to be restarted over the next year with added safety upgrades. (They continued operating for years under observation; Reactor 2 was closed in 1991 after a turbine hall fire, Reactor 1 in 1996, and Reactor 3 – the last – in 2000 ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).)<br>The sarcophagus, while a feat given the circumstances, was understood to be a temporary solution with an expected lifespan of perhaps 20–30 years. By the late 1990s, it had deteriorated – the immense radiation and weathering caused cracks and weakened joints. Authorities installed jacks and braces in 1998 to prevent a collapse of the sarcophagus, as it was by then unstable (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Still, it remained an essential barrier keeping the radioactive inventory of Reactor 4 confined. The success of the initial sarcophagus was that it limited the contamination largely within the 30 km Zone and allowed recovery work to continue around the site with manageable radiation levels.<br>Recognizing the sarcophagus was aging, an international plan was developed to provide a more robust, long-term containment. This led to the New Safe Confinement (NSC) – an enormous arch-shaped structure built to enclose the old sarcophagus and reactor building entirely. The NSC was a project funded by a consortium of nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (managed by the EBRD), with design/construction by Novarka (a French-led team). Construction began in 2012. Unlike the original sarcophagus, which was built in place, the NSC was assembled on a clean pad a short distance away and later slid over Reactor 4. By 2016, the colossal assembly was complete, and in November 2016 the entire 36,000-tonne arch was pushed 327 meters on rails to cover the reactor and old sarcophagus (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and preparatory work onsite was,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and%20preparatory%20work%20onsite%20was,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling equipment were fitted in,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling%20equipment%20were%20fitted%20in,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The NSC is designed to last at least 100 years, with a robust steel frame covered by stainless cladding. It is airtight and equipped with cranes and robotic equipment on the inside. The primary purpose of the NSC is not only to keep radioactive dust from escaping, but also to enable the future dismantling of the dangerously unstable old sarcophagus and the removal of the remaining nuclear fuel and debris inside Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The hermetically sealed building will,using as few personnel as" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20hermetically%20sealed%20building%20will,using%20as%20few%20personnel%20as" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

This will be an extremely challenging task, scheduled to take decades – essentially the final phase of cleaning up Chernobyl.<br>With the NSC in place, the site is far more secure. The new structure prevents water intrusion, controls the environment around the reactor (humidity, etc.), and has filter systems to ensure no radioactive particles leak out during future dismantling work. As of today, the NSC has successfully isolated Reactor 4: radiation levels around the plant have declined further, and the risk of the old sarcophagus collapsing (which could have released dust) is mitigated. In February 2022, during the Russian invasion (discussed later), the NSC’s integrity was maintained despite military occupation of the area. A very recent incident on 14 February 2025 saw a drone strike hit the NSC’s roof, breaching its outer and inner steel panels, but radiation levels remained stable and no radioactive release occurred (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This event underscored the NSC’s importance and resilience.<br>In addition to the NSC, other cleanup infrastructure has been built: for example, a new Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISF-2) was constructed to safely store used nuclear fuel from the remaining Chernobyl reactors, completed in 2020 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent nuclear fuel storage facility,and cold tests took place" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent%20nuclear%20fuel%20storage%20facility,and%20cold%20tests%20took%20place" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Waste processing plants and monitoring systems have been established to manage the tons of radioactive waste generated by decommissioning and cleanup. The overall containment strategy is now long-term stewardship: maintain the new shelter, gradually dismantle the old one, remove and dispose of radioactive materials in a safe manner, and ensure the surrounding environment is protected.Through these massive efforts – from the bravery of the 1986 liquidators to the high-tech engineering of the NSC – the Chernobyl site has been transformed from an open reactor wreck to a contained and monitored facility. While full remediation (removal of all radioactive material) will take many more decades if not centuries, the risk of another release has been vastly reduced. Chernobyl has gone from an active crisis to a case of long-term containment, serving as a stark lesson and model in nuclear disaster management.Nearly four decades on, Chernobyl today is a very different place than it was in 1986. The reactor is silent and enclosed, nature has reclaimed much of the evacuated zone, and what was once a symbol of nuclear catastrophe has also become a site of scientific study, remembrance, and even tourism. This section covers the current conditions, including radiation levels, the status of the Exclusion Zone, ecological developments, and human activities like tourism and restoration projects, incorporating the latest available updates.<br>Ambient radiation levels in the Chernobyl region have dropped significantly since 1986, due to radioactive decay and cleanup efforts. Immediately after the accident, radiation in close proximity to the reactor could be fatal within minutes. Today, aside from a few hot spots, most of the Exclusion Zone has radiation levels that are within safe limits for short-term visits. For perspective, normal natural background radiation is about 2 mSv (millisieverts) per year (which is ~0.0002 mSv/hour). In much of the Exclusion Zone, current dose rates are only a few times above background or even equal to background in some areas (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). For example, walking around in Pripyat town for an hour might give a dose on the order of a few microsieverts – negligible in health terms. The ghost city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl plant’s perimeter, and main roads have been sufficiently decontaminated or decayed that short visits are not dangerous with basic precautions. The New Safe Confinement ensures that Reactor 4’s remains emit virtually no radiation into the outside environment; all major radioactive materials are contained within sturdy structures.<br>However, radioactive “hot spots” remain in certain parts of the Exclusion Zone, and these are unsafe for extended exposure or habitation. The most notorious is the Red Forest just west of Reactor 4. Radiation there is still extremely high – on the order of 0.4 mSv per hour (400 µSv/h) in some patches, which is “thousands of times higher than background levels and dangerous to live in” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). A person standing in the Red Forest for an hour could receive as much radiation as they normally would in several months. Needless to say, nobody is allowed to linger there, and it’s off-limits to tourists (even driving through the area, guides take care to roll up windows and not stop). Other localized hot spots include some parts of the reactor complex’s vicinity, areas where radioactive metal equipment lies in the open, or where fallout concentrated in 1986. These spots are well-mapped by authorities; warning signs mark areas of higher radiation.<br>Importantly, the radiation today is not uniform – it’s very heterogeneous. While one spot might be 0.4 mSv/h, a few hundred meters away it might drop to 0.004 mSv/h. Overall, chronic radiation levels have “plummeted” compared to the initial aftermath, and wildlife and even occasional workers can exist in the zone with only low-level exposure outside the hotspots (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether chronic radiation has any,chronically exposed to low levels" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether%20chronic%20radiation%20has%20any,chronically%20exposed%20to%20low%20levels" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Long-lived isotopes like cesium-137 have undergone over one half-life since 1986, meaning roughly half of the initial amount has decayed away. Shorter-lived isotopes (iodine-131, xenon-133, etc.) disappeared long ago. The areas that remain dangerous are primarily those with concentrated transuranic elements (like parts of the reactor debris with plutonium) or where cesium and strontium were deposited most densely (e.g. forest floor litter).<br>As of today, experts consider the Exclusion Zone safe for controlled access – scientists, workers, and tourists routinely enter for limited periods. The key is limiting time in higher-dose areas and not ingesting any contaminated materials (no eating berries or mushrooms from the zone, for example, as they concentrate radionuclides). The Ukrainian authorities have an extensive radiation monitoring network on-site. According to reports, even after incidents like forest fires or military occupation (more on that below), radiation levels remained “within normal limits” for the zone and did not pose a danger outside the immediate area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>A recent real-world “stress test” of Chernobyl’s stability occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl site and occupied the Exclusion Zone for about five weeks. During that time, there were concerns about disturbances to radioactive soil. Indeed, Ukrainian officials reported a spike in gamma radiation readings, likely because Russian military vehicles churned up contaminated dust in the Red Forest with their movements (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) assessed that the rise was localized and levels “remained low and near background levels” in areas where personnel were present (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).

(There were unconfirmed reports of some Russian soldiers later suffering radiation sickness.) Thankfully, despite the tense situation, no major structural damage occurred at Chernobyl’s containment facilities during the occupation. The plant’s power was cut for a time (raising concern about cooling of spent fuel storage), but backup systems and eventual reconnection prevented any incident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L174 The Chernobyl,on safety as a result" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20The%20Chernobyl,on%20safety%20as%20a%20result" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L195 The SNRIU,first time since 23 February" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L195%20The%20SNRIU,first%20time%20since%2023%20February" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). In late March 2022, Russian troops withdrew, and Ukrainian authorities regained control of the site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022 the Zaporizhzhia&nbsp;plant in southeastern" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022%20the%20Zaporizhzhia%C2%A0plant%20in%20southeastern" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). The episode highlighted that Chernobyl, while largely safe and stable, is still a sensitive site that needs protection. It also demonstrated the resilience of the New Safe Confinement and other systems – they withstood the human disruptions without releasing radiation.<br>Another very recent event was the February 2025 drone strike mentioned earlier. A drone (attributed to Russian forces amid the ongoing conflict) detonated on the roof of the NSC. It managed to puncture the outer and inner steel layers of the NSC’s roof in one spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This was a serious incident, but the redundancy of the NSC’s design meant that even with those holes, no radioactive dust escaped. The IAEA confirmed that radiation levels inside and outside the structure stayed normal (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). Repairs are presumably planned to maintain full integrity. This event underscores that while the radiological condition of Chernobyl is under control, human factors and security remain relevant to its safety.In summary, Chernobyl is not a ticking time bomb now, but a contained contaminated site. Current radiation levels in most areas pose minimal risk for brief exposures, and the worst areas are well-restricted. There is no fission or reaction occurring – the reactor fuel is inert and cooling for decades. The main ongoing safety focus is monitoring and managing the remaining radioactive materials to prevent any environmental release (especially during future fuel removal operations). With the new shelter and strong institutional oversight (even during conflict, international eyes like the IAEA are watching Chernobyl), the site’s condition is stable. It is safe enough for scientists, workers, and even tourists, provided regulations are followed, but it remains unsafe for normal habitation or unrestricted land use in the foreseeable future.The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is the officially designated area that surrounds the nuclear plant, from which routine habitation is excluded due to contamination. It was initially a 30 km radius circle, but over time it has been adjusted to cover the regions of highest fallout. Today, the CEZ in Ukraine spans roughly 2,600 km² (1,000 sq miles), an area nearly the size of Luxembourg. It is a mix of forest, marsh, and abandoned villages and towns. To the north, across the border, Belarus maintains its own 2,200 km² Polesie State Radiation-Ecological Reserve – effectively an extension of the Exclusion Zone. Combined, the whole Chernobyl affected zone is about 4,300–4,400 km² of mostly evacuated land. Within the Ukrainian CEZ, the borders are secured by patrols and checkpoints. One cannot simply wander in; access is controlled by the Chernobyl Zone Authority under Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.<br>The zone remains almost completely devoid of permanent residents. In the chaotic months after the disaster, some residents—especially older folks—were heartbroken at the thought of never returning to their homes. Despite official prohibition, a number of evacuees later snuck back into the Exclusion Zone and resettled in their old villages. These people are known as the “samosely” (self-settlers). Over the years, authorities generally tolerated their presence in small numbers. At their peak in the late 80s and early 90s, around 1,200 samosely lived in the zone; today (as of the 2010s), only an aging few dozen to a couple hundred remain, as many have passed away due to old age (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). These residents live mostly in the outer parts of the zone, subsisting off gardens and pensions – they often say they’d rather face radiation in their beloved homes than live in alien cities. They do receive occasional visits from doctors and supplies, but for the most part they live simply and accept whatever risk exists. Their presence is a poignant human facet of the zone, though they are a tiny exception.For everyone else, the Exclusion Zone is a strictly controlled area. The infrastructure of the zone consists of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant industrial site (where a few thousand workers and security personnel commute for monitoring and projects, working in shifts but not living there), and the town of Chernobyl (about 15 km south of the reactor). The town of Chernobyl (not to be confused with the plant itself) actually still functions as an administrative center for the zone – a few hundred staff, scientists, and officers live there on rotations. It has dormitories, an operational canteen, and even two small hotels for visitors. However, this is not a “normal” town – it’s more like a base camp, since everyone there is on limited stay and monitored for radiation dose.The rest of the zone is characterized by abandoned settlements. Pripyat, once a model city of 50,000, remains empty and decaying – an urban time capsule of Soviet life in 1986. Dozens of villages similarly lie in ruins or are being reclaimed by vegetation. Over 200,000 hectares of the zone are wild land with no active human use. There are checkpoints at the 30 km and 10 km boundaries where dosimeters are used to check vehicles for contamination on exit.<br>Economically and administratively, the Exclusion Zone has been put to some new uses in recent years (covered under “Tourism and Development” below, like solar farms and scientific research). But its status is essentially that of a restricted environmental reserve. In 2016 Ukraine designated the Exclusion Zone as a national biosphere radiological reserve, recognizing its unique environment. There has even been discussion by Ukrainian officials of seeking UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Pripyat and Chernobyl’s cultural landscape, to preserve it as a memorial and scientific site. (In 2021, on the 35th anniversary, Ukraine formally started the process to nominate the CEZ as a World Heritage Site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible Unesco World Heritage Site" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible%20Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site" target="_self">Ukraine Seeks to Designate Chernobyl as a Unesco World Heritage ...</a>), though the war has interrupted these plans.)The security of the zone came under threat during the 2022 Russian invasion, as noted. For the first time, armed conflict intruded into the CEZ. During the Russian occupation, not only was there concern of accidental damage, but also reports of looting (even theft of radioactive lab samples) and disruption of wildfire management. Post-occupation, Ukraine has to demine parts of the zone due to mines left behind. The episode highlighted that the Exclusion Zone remains important strategically – it was a pathway for Russian forces towards Kyiv. After Russian withdrawal, Ukraine reasserted full control and the zone is back to being off-limits except for authorized personnel. The IAEA now has a permanent monitoring presence at Chernobyl as well.In conclusion, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone persists as a largely evacuated territory. It functions as a combination of a radiological reserve, an outdoor laboratory, a memorial landscape, and a buffer around the reactor site. With each passing year, the zone’s identity shifts more towards preservation and research. It stands as a remarkable example of how a large area, once meant for human habitation, has transformed following a technological disaster. Current conditions ensure that the zone will remain set apart for many years to come – a place where time stopped in 1986, now gradually being reclaimed by nature, and cautiously visited by those seeking to understand and remember Chernobyl’s lessons.One of the most intriguing aspects of Chernobyl today is its thriving wildlife and transformed ecosystem. As mentioned in the long-term effects section, the removal of humans has allowed many animal populations to rebound dramatically. The Exclusion Zone has effectively become a wildlife sanctuary – arguably one of the most unexpected nature preserves in the world.<br>Surveys and field research in the 2010s documented an abundance of large mammals. Wolves are considered the top predator in Chernobyl’s food chain now, and they range freely. A 2015 census using track counts and helicopter surveys found that Chernobyl’s wolf population was several times higher than in nearby non-contaminated reserves; prey like deer and wild boar were also plentiful (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The researchers reported “no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance” in the zone, noting that wildlife was doing well in the absence of people (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). This is not to say radiation has no effects, but any potential subtle effects have not prevented populations from growing. Another study published in 2015 in Current Biology concluded the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a “unique sanctuary for wildlife” with greater biodiversity than before the accident, due to human absence (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).Numerous species have returned to the area. For instance, the Eurasian lynx, absent in the region for decades due to hunting and habitat loss, now prowls the forests again. Brown bears have been observed moving through the zone (these had long been gone from this part of Ukraine). The European bison, an endangered species, was introduced to the Ukrainian zone in the 2010s and has since formed a small herd. Przewalski’s horses – critically endangered wild horses native to Central Asia – were released in the late 1990s as an experiment; they thrived and now about 100 of them roam the grasslands near Pripyat, grazing around abandoned villages. Elk (moose) populations are stable, and wild boar are so numerous that they spill out of the zone into surrounding farmland. Birdlife is rich as well: species like black storks, white-tailed eagles, eagle owls, and others are commonly seen. Even rare species like the globally threatened Greater Spotted Eagle have been recorded nesting in the zone. The wetlands in the Pripyat River floodplain inside the CEZ serve as important habitat for migratory birds. Lakes and ponds hold healthy fish populations (famously, the cooling pond of the plant has giant catfish that tourists love to watch – though their size is due to age and lack of fishing, not “mutations”).<br>Scientists continue to study these animals to see how chronic radiation exposure might be affecting them. Some findings are intriguing: for example, Chernobyl’s birds have been found to adapt by producing more anti-oxidants to counter radiation’s oxidative stress. A study on Chernobyl’s wolves has even tracked them leaving the zone, suggesting the zone might be a source of animals repopulating other areas (raising the question of whether they could carry mutations outward – though no evidence of any harmful spread has been observed). Another recent study (2023) on roundworms in the soil found that even after 1,000 generations in Chernobyl’s radionuclide-laden earth, the worms showed an ability to tolerate the radiation without significant genome damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the resurgence of a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the%20resurgence%20of%20a" target="_self">From disaster zone to living laboratory: Chernobyl provides test bed ...</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation,genomes of microscopic worms" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny%20Worms%20Tolerate%20Chornobyl%20Radiation,genomes%20of%20microscopic%20worms" target="_self">Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation - NYU</a>). This hints at potential resilience or repair mechanisms developed by life in the zone.That said, not every creature is thriving. Invertebrates and small mammals have shown mixed results in studies – some have reduced populations in high radiation sectors. Tree growth can be stunted in those areas. There have been reports of some partial “mutations” or anomalies: for instance, a higher frequency of albino barn swallows, or rodents with cataracts. But overall, the ecosystem functions: trees grow, leaves decompose (albeit slower at first), water bodies have oxygen and life, and a full trophic web (plants → herbivores → carnivores) is in place.The Exclusion Zone’s ecology has also benefited from deliberate protections. Since people aren’t farming or logging, forests have matured and expanded. In Belarus’s Polesie Reserve, there are large tracts of primeval-feeling forest that are home to lynx and wolves. Ukraine’s side set up the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve to coordinate ecological conservation and research.<br>Interestingly, the zone provides a case study on rewilding – showing how quickly wildlife can reclaim an area when humans leave. Within 5-10 years of the evacuation, animals from surrounding regions started moving in. Now, Chernobyl is cited as evidence that nature can be remarkably resilient. The United Nations Environment Programme noted that the land around Chernobyl has become “a haven for wildlife” in the absence of human activity (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers have found the land,become a haven for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20the%20land,become%20a%20haven%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">How Chernobyl has become an unexpected haven for wildlife - UNEP</a>). Some have even called it Europe’s own Serengeti (though that’s hyperbole; it is a rich temperate forest ecosystem, not a tropical savanna).It’s crucial to remember the wildlife success does not mean radiation is “good” for animals – rather, it underscores how damaging human habitation can be for wildlife, by comparison. Chernobyl removed the anthropogenic pressures (hunting, farming, pollution other than radiation), and wildlife moved in despite the radiation risk. The long-term genetic consequences for these animal populations are still being studied. But as of now, the biosphere of Chernobyl is vibrant. Visitors often report seeing tracks of wolves and boar everywhere, hearing bird songs in empty villages, or even catching sight of a wild horse galloping across the steppe. It’s a striking contrast: a site of human catastrophe has, over time, transformed into an “accidental wilderness.”<br>In summary, the current ecosystem in the Chernobyl area is a mixture of contamination and regeneration. Forests have overtaken former towns; animals roam where people once worked and played. The zone stands as a unique refuge for biodiversity in Eastern Europe, with higher wildlife abundance than before 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Ongoing research in this living laboratory will continue to inform us about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation on living organisms and about nature’s capacity for resilience after human departure.In recent years, Chernobyl has evolved into a destination for controlled tourism and a site for innovative projects aimed at finding some positive purpose for the Exclusion Zone. Disaster tourism, or “dark tourism,” has grown around Chernobyl, driven by curiosity, education, and the eerie allure of its post-apocalyptic landscape. At the same time, Ukraine has launched efforts to utilize the zone for renewable energy and scientific advancement, turning a place of tragedy into one of renewal.<br>Tourism: In 2011, Ukraine officially opened Chernobyl to tourism, recognizing the public interest and the zone’s educational value (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2011 Chernobyl was officially,tourist attraction%2C with many visitors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202011%20Chernobyl%20was%20officially,tourist%20attraction%2C%20with%20many%20visitors" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Since then, visiting Chernobyl has been possible via licensed tour operators. Tourists must apply in advance, submit their passport details (since it’s a secure area), and they enter on guided tours usually from Kyiv. These tours stick to relatively safe routes; visitors carry dosimeters and are briefed on safety (like not touching vegetation, not sitting on the ground, etc.). Typical tours include stops at the Chernobyl town (to see memorials and equipment graveyards), the Kopachi village ruins (where only a kindergarten building remains as a reminder), the Pripyat city (where one can carefully walk the deserted streets and see sites like the abandoned amusement park, swimming pool, and overgrown city square), and a distant view of the Reactor 4 complex and NSC from a safe distance. Some tours also visit the giant Duga-1 radar (“Russian Woodpecker”) – a huge abandoned Soviet radar installation in the zone. Tourists pass through radiation control gates when exiting to ensure they haven’t inadvertently picked up contamination (in practice, brief visitors rarely do).<br>Chernobyl tourism remained somewhat niche until the late 2010s when it saw a boom. The success of the 2019 HBO “Chernobyl” miniseries brought a surge of interest – tour agencies reported bookings jumping by 30-40% after the show aired (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One Chernobyl tour agency reported,which has attracted outstanding" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One%20Chernobyl%20tour%20agency%20reported,which%20has%20attracted%20outstanding" target="_self">HBO show success drives Chernobyl tourism boom - Reuters</a>). In 2018, roughly 70,000 tourists visited Chernobyl; in 2019, that number swelled to around 120,000 – 125,000 visitors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl sees a spike in,to the 70%2C000 in 2018" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl%20sees%20a%20spike%20in,to%20the%2070%2C000%20in%202018" target="_self">Chernobyl sees a spike in visitors as pop culture influences tourism</a>).

These visitors come from all over the world, drawn by historical interest, a taste for adventure, or even wildlife photography. The Ukrainian government even considered expanding tourist infrastructure given the demand.Tourism has had positive effects: it raises awareness of the disaster’s lessons and provides income (each visitor pays fees that support zone maintenance and local communities outside the zone). Guides emphasize that Chernobyl is a site of remembrance – there are memorials to firefighters and evacuees, and many tours include meeting an actual evacuee or a liquidator who can share their story. Visitors are often struck by the poignancy of places like Pripyat: an empty nursery with children’s toys still there, or murals peeling off school walls – snapshots of 1980s Soviet life frozen in time. This “open-air museum” aspect is why preservationists have pushed for UNESCO status, to protect it from decay and looting.Tourism was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again in 2022 because of the war. As of 2023, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tourist access is suspended for security reasons. But prior to that, Chernobyl had firmly established itself as a tourist destination, and it likely will again when conditions normalize. It’s not a Disneyfied experience – the trips are somber and heavily managed – but it provides a powerful insight into nuclear history and its consequences.Restoration and Development Projects: While the land will be unsafe for farming or regular habitation for a long time, Ukraine has sought creative ways to utilize the Exclusion Zone. One idea has been to turn it into a hub for renewable energy. The reasoning: the zone has abundant land that cannot be used for agriculture, and it has existing high-voltage power lines (from when the plant generated electricity) that connect to the grid. So, why not install solar panels or wind turbines there?<br>In 2018, the first project materialized – a 1 megawatt solar power plant was built within sight of the old reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The new one,first years of its operation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The%20new%20one,first%20years%20of%20its%20operation" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Installed by a Ukrainian-German company, this solar farm consists of about 3,800 photovoltaic panels on a 1.6 hectare plot, right near the Chernobyl plant. It was connected to the grid and, symbolically, began generating power again at Chernobyl (the first electricity from the site since the last reactor shut down in 2000) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It is the first time,would never produce energy again" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20first%20time,would%20never%20produce%20energy%20again" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). This small solar station powers about 2,000 homes, and plans were floated for expansion. The Ukrainian government has actively promoted the Exclusion Zone as a site for renewable energy projects, pitching that up to 2.5 GW of solar capacity could eventually be installed (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Interest was shown by companies from China, France, and other countries in building solar farms in the late 2010s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). The cheap land (effectively free, since it’s unusable for other purposes) and existing transmission lines make it economically attractive – with the caveat that construction workers can only spend limited hours in the area for safety (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two years ago%2C a giant,reactor to be dismantled safely" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20giant,reactor%20to%20be%20dismantled%20safely" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).<br>Similarly, in 2021 Ukraine announced plans for a large wind farm in the Exclusion Zone. In partnership with a European company, they envision up to 1 GW of wind energy capacity to be developed in the zone (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear option%3A Ukraine plans one,around the Chernobyl nuclear plant" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear%20option%3A%20Ukraine%20plans%20one,around%20the%20Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant" target="_self">Nuclear option: Ukraine plans one of Europe's largest wind farms in ...</a>). If realized, that would make it one of Europe’s biggest onshore wind farms. Such a project would further transform Chernobyl from a symbol of nuclear disaster into a contributor to clean energy production (without the risks of nuclear). As of the latest updates, these plans are on hold due to the war, but Ukraine has indicated strong interest in resuming them once it’s safe.Besides energy, the zone is used for scientific research and environmental monitoring. Ecologists, biologists, and radiologists from around the world work in the CEZ to study radiation effects on nature, remediation techniques, and even astrophysics (the low light pollution makes it good for certain telescopic observations). There have been projects to test robotic equipment for radiation mapping, to experiment with phytoremediation (using plants to extract radionuclides from soil), and to monitor wildfires via satellites. The zone’s administration also employs people in forestry (they actively manage some forests to reduce fire risk, by removing dry fuel). Some contaminated wood is harvested under careful conditions and used as biomass fuel in special power plants (with filtration) outside the zone – a bit controversial, but an attempt to utilize resources while controlling pollution.One notable “restoration” in a cultural sense is the preservation of certain buildings. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself still has workers doing decommissioning. Tours can visit the control room of Reactor 4 now (in full gear, for a short 5-minute look) – it was opened to very limited visiting in 2019 as part of raising awareness. The control room is, of course, contaminated and everything inside remains as it was after the accident (now with higher radiation levels), so such visits are symbolic. There is also the Chernobyl Museum in Kiev (Kyiv) which is outside the zone but dedicated to its history.One can’t mention restoration without noting that Chernobyl will never be “restored” to its pre-1986 state in the literal sense. The goal is more about containment and adaptation. The current strategy (per international plans) is to keep the reactor area safe and start removing the fuel debris between now and 2065, package the waste, and then possibly begin to dismantle the NSC and other structures after that. Meanwhile, large parts of the Exclusion Zone may be left to nature indefinitely. Some areas with lower contamination could potentially be opened for limited use sooner – for example, a few outer villages were reclassified in the 2010s to allow former residents to visit or even live with some restrictions (particularly in parts of Belarus). But for the most contaminated core zones, the “no man’s land” will persist for many generations – essentially as a wildlife reserve and historical monument.Latest updates (as of early 2025): The war in Ukraine has introduced uncertainties – for instance, the renewable projects are paused, and the zone occasionally faces security issues. But the NSC and other safety systems are functioning. Ukraine’s government remains committed to integrating the zone into its future plans (President Zelensky in 2020 declared Chernobyl a place of “special importance” that should be turned from a negative into a positive symbol). There’s talk of developing better infrastructure for tourists and researchers once it’s feasible.Chernobyl has also become part of global pop culture and education. Documentaries and movies abound. The site draws not only tourists but also journalists, scientists, and even video game designers (the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is set in a fictionalized Chernobyl zone). This human engagement with Chernobyl today is part of its ongoing story – ensuring that the lessons of 1986 are not forgotten and that maybe something constructive can arise from the tragedy.<br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was a cataclysmic event with causes rooted in design flaws and human error, producing immediate devastation to human life and the environment. Its immediate consequences included loss of life, widespread radioactive contamination, and political upheaval. Over the long term, it has had complex health outcomes (notably thousands of thyroid cancers, but surprisingly limited other health impacts according to UNSCEAR) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), and it left a profound mark on ecology – decimating some aspects of the environment while inadvertently creating a wildlife haven. The disaster also influenced geopolitical currents, hastening the Soviet Union’s end and reshaping global nuclear policy.Cleanup efforts were unprecedented in scale – from the half-million liquidators who risked their health, to the massive engineering feats of containment with the sarcophagus and New Safe Confinement. Today, Chernobyl stands in a state of stable containment: radiation is largely confined, Reactor 4 is entombed under the new arch, and the area is under constant monitoring. The surrounding Exclusion Zone has transformed into a unique sanctuary for biodiversity and a living museum of the anthropocene. Current radiation levels in most of the zone are low enough to allow visits, although the land will not be fully “clear” for normal life for centuries in the most affected parts.<br>Chernobyl’s story is still unfolding – it’s a story of warning about the dangers of nuclear power without proper safety, but also a story of resilience (of people and nature). Efforts continue in making the site useful – whether generating solar electricity or providing invaluable scientific data on radiation’s effects. As of today, Chernobyl is both a monument to a past disaster and a dynamic environment of recovery. It remains a sobering reminder of the costs of human error, and a testament to international cooperation in mitigating a disaster’s aftermath.
