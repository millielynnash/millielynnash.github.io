She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.
It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
It is not okay to ask for what you want.
It is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: "What do you see going on between your and your ?"
"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family." New Homeostasis takes hold. Involves trying out these learnings. Satir's most distinctive intervention

This is a 'yes man' who talks as though they could do nothing for themselves; they must always get someone's approval. They may experience feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit during conflict or disagreement. You may think of yourself as really worth nothing. You are lucky just to be allowed to eat. You owe everybody gratitude, and you really are responsible for everything that goes wrong. Naturally, you will agree with any criticism of you. You are grateful that anyone even talks to you, no matter what they say or how they say it. You would not think of asking anything for yourself. After all, who are you to ask? Besides, if you can just be good enough, it will come by itself. Think of yourself as being physically down on one knee, wobbling a bit, and putting out one hand in a begging fashion. Keep your head up so your neck will hurt, your eyes will strain, and in no time at all your head will ache. When you talk in this position, your voice Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. Acknowledge Other/Context Minimizes self (sometimes context)
People-pleasing tendencies Therapeutic Implications: Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs
Assertiveness/clear communication of needs
Less directive therapy methods
Multiple choice options to practice sense of agency Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. Placating (Placator)
<br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. "The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341) Unique Spirit
Being authentically who they are is one of the most essential interventions in Satir's approach. Creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently. Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic.

To change the world is to change the family.
Family life is something like an iceberg: most people are aware of only about one-tenth of what is going on - the tenth that they can see and hear. Just as a sailor's fate depends on knowing that the bulk of the iceberg is under the water, so a family's fate depends on understanding the feelings and needs that lie beneath every family events. (What goes on under the table?) Over the years I have developed a picture of what human beings living humanly are like. They are people who understand, value, and develop their bodies, finding them beautiful and useful. They are real and honest to and about themselves and others; they are loving and kind to themselves and others. People living humanly are willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, and to change when the situation calls for it. They find ways to accommodate what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not. The family is the context in which a person with such dimensions developers. And the adults in charge are the peoplemakers. Four aspects of family life: The feelings and ideas one has about oneself, which I call self-worth. The ways people use to work out meaning with one another, which I call communication.
The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into what I call the family system.
The way people relate to other people and institutions outside the family, which I call the link to society. In all the troubled families I noticed that: Self-wroth was low
Communication was indirect, vague, and not really honest
Rules were indirect, nonnegotiable, and everlasting
The family's link to society was fearful, placating, and blaming In all nurturing families, I consistently see a different pattern: Self-worth is high
Communication is direct, clear, specific, and honest
Rules are flexible, human, appropriate, and subject to change
The link to society is open and hopeful, and is based on choice The changes all rest on new learnings, new awareness, and a new consciousness. Everyone can achieve these. Families everywhere deal with the same issues. In all families... Every person communicates; the question is, How, and what happens as a result? Every person follows rules; the question is, What kind, and how well do they work for them? Every person is linked to society; the question is, In what way, and what are the results? Natural Family The man and woman who sired and conceived the child continue to care for that child until the child is grown One-Parent Family One parent leaves the family by death, divorce, or desertion, and all of the parenting is done by the remaining parent Blended Family Children are parented by step-, adoptive, foster, or gay parents Institutional Family Groups of adults rear groups of children, as in institutions, communes, or extended families The same forces will be at work in all families: Self-Worth
Communication
Rules
Links to Society People are always doing the best they can. Developing a family is the hardest, most complicated job in the world. The very fact that you are reading this tells me that you care about yourself and the well-being of your family. Knowing something begins a change; experiencing makes it happen. If you feel shy or doubtful about inviting family members to participate in these exercises with you, become thoroughly familiar with what you are asking, feel it from your heart, and present your wish simply and directly. "Will you participate with me in an experiment that I think might be useful to use?" You maximize the opportunity for a positive response. Badgering, demanding, or nagging people to go along turns the transaction into a power struggle. <br>(I think this may be refer to the <a data-href="Battle for Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Structure</a> and the <a data-href="Battle for Initiative" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Initiative</a>) I see two kinds of pain: Pain of recognition of problems
Pain of blame
The first we can't avoid; the second we can.

Does it feel good to you to live in your family right now?
Do you feel you are living with friends, people you like and trust, and who like and trust you?
Is it fun and exciting to be a member of your family?
Family that is more or less troubled does not mean you have a bad family. It only means that people aren't very happy and have not learned ways to love and value one another openly. Families can be placed somewhere along a scale from 'very nurturing' to 'very troubled' The atmosphere in a troubled family is easy to feel. I quickly sense discomfort. Sometimes it feels cold. Sometimes it feels as if everything were constantly spinning, like a top; I get dizzy and can't find my balance. Or it may be an atmosphere of foreboding, like the lull before a storm, when thunder may crash and lightning strike at any moment. Sometimes I feel very sad and cannot find an obvious reason. I realize that's because the sources are covered up. I begin to understand why so many members of troubled families were beset with physical ills. Their bodies were simply reacting humanly to a very inhuman atmosphere. Everybody has physical reactions to individuals around him or her. The first step of change is to recognize what is happening. There is little evidence of friendship among individual family members, little joy in one another. The family seems to stay together through duty, with people just trying to tolerate one another. More often humor is caustic, sarcastic, even cruel. The adults are so busy telling the child and each other what to do and what not to do that they never get to enjoy themselves as persons. In some families, people simply avoided one another. The family can be the place where one finds love and understanding and support, even when all else fails; where we can be refreshed and recharged to cope more effectively with the world outside. No one would intentionally pick this troubled way of living. Families accept it only because they know of no other way. A nurturing family is where I would be listened to and would be interested in listening to others; I would be considered and would wish to consider others. I could openly show my affection as well as my pain and disapproval. I would not be afraid to take risks because everyone in my family would realize that some mistakes are bound to come with my risk-taking - that my mistakes are a sign that I am growing. I would feel like a person in my own right - noticed, valued, loved, and clearly asked to notice, value, and love others. I would feel free to respond with humor and laughter when it fits. The houses in which these people live tend to have a lot of light and color. Clearly a place where people live, these homes are planned for their comfort and enjoyment, not as showplaces for the neighbors. When there is quiet, it is peaceful quiet, not the stillness of fear and caution. Each person seems to know that they will have the chance to be heard. If one's turn doesn't come now, it is only because there isn't time - not because one isn't loved. People seem comfortable about touching one another and showing their affection, regardless of age. People show their loving and caring by talking openly and listening with concern, being straight and real with one another, and simply being together. Members of a nurturing family feel free to tell each other how they feel. Anything can be talked about. Nurturing families can make plans. If something interferes with the plan, they can readily make adjustments, often with a sense of humor. This way they are able to handle more of life's problems without panicking. Thus the incident would be used as a learning opportunity (which raises the child's self-worth) rather than as a cause for punishment, which puts that self-worth into question. In the nurturing family it is easy to pick up the message that human life and human feelings are more important than anything else. These parents see themselves as empowering leaders, not as authoritative bosses. They see their job primarily as one of teaching their children how to be truly human in all situations. The behavior of these parents matches what they say. How different from the troubled parent who tells the children not to hurt each other, but slaps them whenever displeased. Parents are people; they learn that good leaders are careful of their timing: they watch for an opportunity to talk to their children when they can really be heard. When a child has misbehaved, the father or mother moves physically close to offer support. This helps the offending child overcome fear and guilt feelings and make the best of the teaching the parent is about to offer. We can help make new contacts with others and pave the way for better ways of dealing with each other. Parents in nurturing families know that their children are not intentionally bad. If someone behaves destructively, parents realize some misunderstanding has arisen or someone's self-esteem is dangerously low. They know people learn only when valuing themselves and feeling valued, so they don't respond to behavior in a way that will make people feel devalued. Even when it is possible to change behavior by shaming or punishing, the resulting scar is not easily or quickly healed. When a child must be corrected, nurturing parents rely on being clear: Asking for information, listening, touching, understanding, using careful timing, and being aware of the child's feelings and natural wishes to learn and to please. Children learn from the modeling of direct behavior. Parents in a nurturing family realize problems come along, simply because life offers them, and they will be alert to creative solutions as each new problem appears. Troubled families, on the other hand, put all their energies into the hopeless attempt to keep problems from happening; when they do happen - and, of course, they always do - these people have no resources left for solving the crisis. Nurturing parents realize change is inevitable. They accept change as part of being alive and try to use it creatively to make their families still more nurturing. The human heart is always seeking love. Troubled families make troubled people and thus contribute to the devaluing of self. Giving ourselves full permission to make the family a place to develop people who are more truly human will reflect itself in a safer and more humanly responsive world. We can make the family a real place for developing real people. Each of us is a discovery, and each of us makes a difference. Most of the things that caused families to be troubled are learned after birth. Since they are learned, they can be unlearned, and new things can be learned in their place. You need to recognize that your family sometimes is a troubled family. You need for forgive yourself for past mistakes and give yourself permission to change, knowing that things can be different. Make a decision to change things. Take some action to start the process of change. Whatever may have happened in the past represented the best you knew how to do at the time. Chances are that the causes of your family pain have been invisible to all of you. <br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is a concept, an attitude, a feeling, an image; and it is represented by behavior. When I was a little girl, I lived on a farm in Wisconsin. On our back porch was a huge black iron pot, which had lovely rounded sides and stood on three legs. My mother made her own soap, so for part of the year the pot was filled with soap. When threshing crews came through in the summer, we filled the pot with stew. At other times, my father used it to store manure for my mother's flower beds. We came to call it the "3-S pot." Anyone who wanted to use the pot faced two questions: What is the pot now full of, and how full is it? When people told me about themselves - whether they felt full, empty, dirty, or even 'cracked' - I thought of that old pot. Pot is a plain word in this use, almost a nonsense word. Families often find it easier to express themselves in pot terms and to understand when other people express themselves this way. When I say 'pot,' I mean self-worth or self-esteem. Every person has a feeling of worth, positive or negative. As with my old family pot, the questions are: Is my self-worth negative or positive at this point, and how much of it is there? <br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is the ability to value one's self and to treat oneself with dignity, love, and reality. Anyone who is loved is open to change. The crucial factor in what happens both inside people and between people is one's self-worth, one's pot. Integrity, honesty, responsibility, compassion, love, and competence - all flow easily from people whose self-esteem is high. We feel that we matter, that the world is a better place because we are here. We have faith in our own competence. We are able to ask others for help, yet we believe we can make our own decisions and are, in the end, our own best resources. Appreciating our own worth, we are ready to see and respect the worth of others. We radiate trust and hope. We don't have rules against anything we feel. We also know that we don't have to act on everything we feel. We can choose. Our intelligence directs our actions. We accept all of ourselves as human. Vital people feel high-pot most of the time. But vital people treat these temporary low-pot feelings as just what they are: a crisis of the moment. This crisis might well be the birth pains of some new possibility for us. We may feel uncomfortable at the time but do not have to hide. We know we can emerge from this crisis whole. When people feel they have little worth, they expect to be cheated, stepped on, and depreciated by others. This opens the way to becoming a victim. Expecting the worst, these people invite it and usually get it. To defend themselves, they hide behind a wall of distrust and sink into the terrible feeling of loneliness and isolation. Thus separated from other people, they become apathetic, indifferent toward themselves and those around them. It is hard for them to see, hear, or think clearly, and therefore they tend to step on and depreciate others. People who feel this way build huge psychological walls behind which they hide, and then defend themselves by denying they are doing this. Fear is a natural consequence of this distrust and isolation. Fear constricts and blinds us; it keeps us from risking new ways of solving our problems. Instead, we turn to still more self-defeating behavior. (Fear, incidentally, is always fear of some future thing) As soon as a person confronts or challenges whatever they are afraid of in the present, the fear vanishes. When persons with constant low-pot feelings experience defeat, they often label themselves as failures. After enough of these reactions, the self is vulnerable to drugs, alcohol, or others flights from coping. Feeling low is not the sameas low-pot. Low pot essentially means that when you experience undesireable feelings, you try to behave as though those feelings did not exist. It takes a lot of high self-worth to acknowledge your low feelings. Persons of high self-esteem can feel low. The difference is that people who are feeling low don't label themselves as worthless or pretend that their low feelings do not exist. Nor do they project their feeling on someone else. It makes a big difference whether one condemns one's self or sees this low time as a human condition with which one needs to cope. I shall be frequently calling your attention to this process of coping. Feeling low and not admitting it is a form of lying to yourself and others. Devaluing your feelings this way is a direct link to devaluing yourself, thus deepening the conditions of low pot. Much of what happens to us is the outcome of our attitude. Since it is attitude, we can change it. To build your self-worth: Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. An infant coming into the world must rely on experiences with people and their messages about their worth as a person. For the first five or six years, the child's self-esteem is formed almost exclusively by the family. After the child starts school, other influences come into play; the family remains important. Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication).
Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued?
Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere in which individual differences are appreciated, love is shown openly, mistakes are used for learning, communication is open, rules are flexible, responsibility (matching promise with delivery) is modeled and honest is practiced - the kind of atmosphere found in a nurturing family. Children in troubled families often feel worthless, growing up as they must amid 'crooked' communication, inflexible rules, criticism of their differentness, punishment for their mistakes, and no experience in learning responsibility. Such children are highly at risk of developing destructive behavior toward themselves and/or others. Much of an individual's potential is held in abeyance when this happens. Parents with high self-esteem are more likely to create nurturing families, and low self-worth parents to produce troubled families. The system evolves out of the architects of the family: the parents. I do hold parents responsible for accepting the consequences of their actions and learning to do differently. This is a good first step to improving the whole family situation. <br>It is possible to raise anyone's <a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a>, no matter what one's age or condition. Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. "There is always hope that your life can change, because you can always learn new things."
<br><a data-href="My Declaration of Self-Esteem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/my-declaration-of-self-esteem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">My Declaration of Self-Esteem</a> Our body language and activities reflect our thoughts and emotions. When we appreciate and love ourselves, our energy builds. When we use this energy positively and harmoniously to make a smoothly running system within each self, it creates a strong foundation from which that self can cope creatively, realistically, and compassionately with what life presents. "When I feel good about myself and life myself, the chances are excellent that I will be able to meet life from a position of dignity, honesty, strength, love, and reality." If a person's feeling toward themselves is one of depreciation, limitation, disgust, or any other negative attitude, the energy becomes diffused and fragmented. The self weakens, becoming a victim defeated by life: "If I do not like myself, I devalue and punish myself. I meet life from a position of fear and impotence, creating a state in which I feel victimized and act according. I punish myself and others blindly. I become interchangeably subservient and tyrannical. I hold others responsible for my actions." A person feels they do not count, feel a constant threat of rejection, and lacks the ability to look at themselves, others, and events in perspective. This is a state of low self-esteem.
A person who does not value themselves will expect someone else to be responsible for bestowing that value. This often leads to endless manipulations that usually backfire on both parties. To avoid being against others, people have been taught to love others instead of themselves. This results in self-depreciation. The question also arises, if one does not love self, how can one know how to love others? We have plenty of evidence that loving oneself makes it possible to love others; self-worth and selfishness are not the same. I have found that the first step toward diminishing fear is to acknowledge it openly. Then check your perception: "Is that true?" Fear of Rejection Good human relations and appropriate and loving behavior stem from persons who have strong feelings of self-worth. Simply stated, persons who love and value themselves are able to love and value others and treat reality appropriately. Having a strong sense of self-worth is the way to become more fully human, to having health and happiness, gaining and maintaining satisfying relationships, and being appropriate, effective, and responsible. When one cares for oneself, one will not do anything to injure, degrade, humiliate, or otherwise destroy oneself or another, and will not hold others responsible for one's actions. People who care for themselves would not violate their relationships to others through violence. Those who do not love themselves can easily become instruments of hate and destruction by unscrupulous people. They essentially give away their power, which often leads to emotional slavery. Perpetual placating exemplifies this. The stronger one's self-worth, the easier it is to have and maintain the courage to change one's behavior. The more one values oneself, the less one demands from others. The less one demands from others, the more one can feel trust. The more one trusts oneself and others, the more one can love. The more one loves others, the less one fears them. The more one builds with them, the more one can know them. The more one knows another, the greater is one's bond and bridge with them. Self-worth behavior will thus help end the isolation and alienation between persons, groups, and nations today. <br>(MA: is this referencing <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>?)

Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts.

This has to do with your spiritual connection. This represents your relationship to your life force. How do you regard your life? Do you honor it? Do you use your spiritual connection in your daily life? This has to do with your context. This refers to the sights and sounds, the feel of things, the temperature, the light, the color, the quality of air, and the space where you live and work. Each of these factors has an important effect on your life. This has to do with nutrition. What kind of food and drink do you put into your body? Diagnostic Assessment This shows how you interact with the people in your world. Your interaction shapes the nature of your relationships. How do you evaluate the quality of your various relationships? How do you use your power? Do you give it away and become a victim? Do you use it to become a dictator? Do you use it to develop harmony within yourself and with others, thus becoming an empowering leader? Do you use your power to nurture yourself or others, or to threaten? Do you team up with family members of others to do things together? Do you have fun, make jokes, and generally use good humor to make your life and that of others lighter and happier? Remember that humor and love are two very powerful healing forces. Initial Phase
Walk the client through the ingredients of an interaction: What do I hear and see?
What meanings do I make of what I hear and see?
What feelings do I have about the meanings I make?
What feelings do I have about these feelings?
What defenses do I use?
What rules for commenting do I use?
What is my response to the situation? The individual is at the center, and surrounding them are the eight universal human resources: spiritual, contextual, nutritional, interactional, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and physical. Each part is interconnected. The less these 8 areas are given energy and time, the lower a person's self-esteem. This is the cohnitive part of your brain. This lens tells you about the information you take in, the thoughts you have, and the meaning you give them. From this cognitive and rational part, you can get answers to such questions as, "What do I understand? How do I learn new things? How do I analyze situations and solve problems?" This is the physical body with all its parts and systems.
Find a good anatomy book in which you can see pictures of your bones, muscles, internal organs, together with all the different systems. Let yourself be awed and amazed at how wonderfully your body is engineered and what a treasure house of resources it contains. Apply this information to your own body. Are you, its owner, meeting its needs? Are you listening to it? It will tell you when you are tired, hungry, or over-stressed, or alert you to any part of you that needs special care. This is that of your emotions, your feelings. How free are you to recognize and acknowledge them? What restrictions do you put on your feelings? How do you express them?
All feelings are human. They bring texture, color, and sensitivity to life. Without feelings, we would be robots. <br>Your feelings about these feelings show you where your self-worth is in relation to your feelings. <img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/in-session-diagrams/satir's-self-mandala-diagram.png" draggable="false" target="_self">Satir's Self-Mandala Diagram.png<img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/in-session-diagrams/five-communication-stances.png" draggable="false" target="_self">Five Communication Stances.png

When we do so, we function from a <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication stance. This is the healthiest position we can operate from. The Satir Growth Model is a strength-based approach, focusing on the existing resources that family members bring with them. Faulty coping strategies maintain problematic interactions. Therapy provides a safe space for people to choose alternative ways of coping. Therapy increases people's self-esteem, leading them to be able to lean into their uniqueness and provide a space for their loved ones to feel comfortable in their own uniqueness as well. Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic. (Congruence) Self-Esteem Maintenance Kit: Detective Hat: Used when there is something new that the person wants to understand better. It helped them shift away from judging an experience to exploring it. Medallion: Two-sided and says 'yes' on one side and 'no' on the other. It is intended to help the person recognize that they can say either word, depending on what they truly want, so they can maintain their integrity. Wand (Empowering wand, courage stick, wishing wand): Helps people move from inaction based on fear to action based on desire. Golden Key: Opens any door - helping the person ask questions they might not have previously, so the unsayable, and do the undoable. Wisdom Box: Helps connect the person to the wider world and all that has come before them. <br>Experiential therapists are interactive in the therapy room. They try to use their whole self for contact. This includes adopting an <a data-href="I-Thou Perspective" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">I-Thou Perspective</a>, where they try to promote human-to-human interaction. Since one of the main goals of therapy is to help the client become more congruent, it is important for the therapist to engage the client congruently. The therapist must be a real person who helps model a way of being for the client. Experiential therapists conceptualize a few main processes: Status Quo: The family is currently in this process, and is leading to difficulties bringing them to therapy. Foreign Element: The family's expression of the desire to change. Chaos: The therapist's introduction of novelty into the system. Integration: Family members put what they learn from therapy into practice. Practice: Involves trying out these learnings. New Status Quo:
- New homeostasis takes hold.<br>

Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways: The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another. <br><a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a>: Designed to help an individual connect better to the historical and psychological interconnections of their family.

The overall goal is to increase the star's self-esteem so they are empowered to engage with themselves and others in new and more productive ways. This should engender more hope in them for their future. <br><a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>: Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities.

"The Growth Model," where the focus was on helping people access their inner resources as opposed to, "The Medical Model," where the emphasis was on pathology and symptom reduction. <br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. "The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341) Her goals for family therapy included helping the individual members increase their sense of worth and value by accessing their inner resources and by decreasing any emotional blocks. And for the family as a whole, she saw the goal as being to increase congruent communication and heart connections. She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.
It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
It is not okay to ask for what you want.
It is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: "What do you see going on between your and your ?"
"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family." <br>She also helped them to make better connections with each other by decreasing their defensiveness.

Cutting-Off (Refusing to talk to the other for days or longer.) Within a family system, these defenses can be played out in interactional patterns such as: Blame - Blame
Blame - Withdraw
Placate - Placate
Blame - Placate
Blame - Distract
Withdraw - Withdraw Satir developed a process for helping people change and become more connected. Her process is described as having six phases: Phase 1 - Making Contact Satir would reach out using her body position, eye contact, and facial expression to make contact with each member. She would also consciously work to connect from her spirit to theirs. Phase 2 - Validating Satir worked to help people feel validated in many ways such as reflecting their feelings, affirming their values and highlighting their inner resources. Examples include: "You feel scared because your son got suspended from school."
"You value education."
"You are courageous to seek help." Phase 3 - Facilitating Awareness Satir had many different ways that she would attempt to bring awareness to a family about their defensive patterns in a non-blaming way. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Satir placed the members in body positions to give them a picture of their defensive behavior. For the blaming stance, she would position the person leaning toward another and pointing at them and for the placating stance, she would position the person down on one knee with their head down and their hand up in a pleading position. Satir would also bring awareness to members by exploring their inner experiences. She used the metaphor of an iceberg to help the family therapist to conceptualize the inner level so experience driving defensive behaviors. Above the water line were the inner levels of experience such as feelings, perceptions, expectations, beliefs, and yearnings. (What meaning are you giving to what your ___ said that is causing you to feel hurt? Is that a familiar place for you to go to when someone is disappointed in you? What is it you yearn for?) Phase 4 - Promoting Acceptance One of the ways that satir promoted acceptance was through 'normalizing,' that is, reassuring the family member that what they were experiencing was normal. ("It is normal to...")
Another way that she promoted acceptance was by 'bridging' between conflicting parties. ("I am hearing that is is not easy for _, I would be interested to know how life was for you when you were their age?") Phase 5 - Eliciting Positive Choices and Changes Once Satir observed that the family members were aware of and accepting of their unhelpful patterns, she would lead them into seeing new possibilities for their interactions. After sculpting the family, she would ask them to each to stand in a balanced way and look at each other. She would then guide them in a dialogue helping them to express themselves in non-defensives ways. Other times she would simply have them sit face to face and she would guide the dialogue between them. "What happens for you when your says you choose over your ? You feel... Did you know that your felt __? What happened for you when you heard them express their feelings? You long to be more connected with them. You miss them. How do you feel to hear how much they miss you?" Phase 6 - Reinforcing Change Satir would often combine verbal responses with some supportive touch to reinforce a positive shift. The therapist also needs to work on their own personal growth. This is true for working with individuals but it is even more true when working with families as the chances of being triggered by your own family experience are even greater. As Satir used to say, "You are the most important instrument in the room!" Under threat and reward, change is painful: change is viewed as unnatural, the unknown is feared, the status quo is maintained, life's natural 'flow' is blocked, and the familiar is valued despite discomfort. The seed model has people viewing change more positively; as naturally occurring at a variety of levels (from cellular to cosmic) and as scary, but offering new opportunities. Discomfort is seen as a signal for change. Therapists using the seed model keep in mind that families entering therapy are problem-focused and will maintain the status quo as a necessary survival behavior. Therapist should make contact with each person to communicate a climate of acceptance (e.g., people do the best they can) and hear them out to discover 'what is.'
Understanding the status quo stage is essential to clarify how the change process gets started or is blocked. This stage is explored further by examining resistance and readiness concepts in detail. The coin of change has resistance and readiness as its head and tail sides. Experientially, we may want to change in one moment and fear or sabotage it in the next. Then status quo is considered a trance, accounting for change resistance as well as a medium in which change may be fostered. Changing circumstances elicit shifts in perception, which in turn stimulate changes in thinking, feeling, and acting. But when circumstances shift back, behavior also reverts. Perception can appear to create change of behavior when the meaning of an event is reframed, but the underlying pattern is not altered. Altering the underlying pattern requires dealing with resistance to change. Resistance is a coping behavior intended to preserve the organism rather than obstruct change. Reframing resistance in terms of its positive intention. The way we are socialized has us, "Gradually acquiring a variety of commitments which constrain the person into following a consistent pattern of behavior." The effect is to develop a lifestyle that stabilizes the events in our lives, our interdependence of meaning of these events, and the way we define ourselves, as well as predisposing us to seek consistent situations. Experientially, change involves invoking the unfamiliar. Intellectualizing, avoiding feelings, compulsive activity, impatience about change, and dwelling in the past are all ways of dealing with the confusion by maintaining the status quo. The tasks at this stage are to cope with the threat to past security and sense of competence and self-esteem; deal with feelings of loss and longing for the past.
Conservative impulse, the will to change has to overcome an impulse to restore the past, to resist the change. Survival depends on this impulse. By stabilizing perceptions, the conservative impulse enhances the ability to learn from experience. Only when it does not fit this construct is its 'newness' experienced. <br><a data-href="Readiness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/readiness.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Readiness</a> refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>. Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain. Four patterns emerge reflecting the relative influence of these readiness factors. These patters are based on the degree of difficulty involved in making the change and the degree of responsibility the person is wiling to take for making the change. <br><a data-href="Preemptive Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preemptive Change</a>: This pattern describes 'overnight' change. The inordinate strength of the motivating influences lowers the degree of difficulty in making the change. The degree of responsibility for the change is also low. The change in circumstances preempts issues of loss (leaving family and friends), self-efficacy ("Can I do it?"), and self-esteem ("Am I worth the effort?") that are ordinarily addressed in making changes. Problems maintaining the change may require attention at a later point in the change process. Change literally 'happens' to us in this pattern, but we have little sense of ownership of it. <br><a data-href="Self-Managed Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Managed Change</a>: In this pattern, the influences motivating the change are less extreme or immediate than those noted in the preemptive patter. The person is influenced to take a conscious and self-responsible approach to change and is required to deal with one or more of the issues of loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in order to resolve the resistance to change. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" target="_self">Satir Family Therapy - YouTube</a> Experiential family therapies include four approaches: <br><a data-href="Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)</a>

No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Must increase ability to recognize thoughts and feelings of self and others.
The focus for the therapist is on creating safety. Help them learn to recognize, and not be afraid of their thoughts and the thoughts of others. Stances acknowledge or minimize three realities: Self
Other
Context When we feel unsafe, we revert back to one of these communication stances. These are the stances used when someone is frightened. When we don't feel safe as children, we evolve communication stances to survive when we do not feel safe when we are young. You can use the communication stances to help better understand how to intervene, or how to communicate with your client. When you are working with a placator, be cautious if you are going to be making a suggestion it may help to give options. "Which do you think is the best fit or might work for you?" Ask them to give voice to their thoughts and opinions because they will be very quick even to please the therapist. Their task us to learn to assert themselves in a healthy way, how can they assert their needs so that they don't become resentful, depressed (needs do not get taken care of because they are not advocating for themselves) Therapy involves going through stages several times. Can be a new way of looking at the interactions and how to communicate in a more congruent way.

Establishing credibility You must instill the hope to clients you can be helpful for them. Emotional Role of Symptom Symptom has a role in the family system Example: Child's exaggerated acting out may serve to reduce tension in marriage by getting parents on the same page. If the therapist can understand how symptom makes emotional sense, it will be easier to help find ways to interact successfully. Problematic family dynamics typically involve: Power struggles
Parental conflicts
Lack of validation
Lack of intimacy Each person's role in family is assessed to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles: Martyr
Victim or helpless one
Rescuer
Good child/parent
Bad child/parent Timeline that includes major events in individual's or family's life. Births and deaths
Important family events: Marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss Important historical events: Wars, natural disasters, economic downturns Gives both the therapist and client insight into the context of the problem as well as strengths and resources might exist. Child, mother, and father and quality of relationship between them. In this primary triad a child learns how to be human. The triad should serve as nurturing system for child. When the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. Layers of the iceberg: Behavior (Top Layer)
Coping (Above)
Feelings (Below) that are related to coping
Perceptions, how is the person perceiving their life or how do they make meaning?
Expectations, what are the expectations that are fueling all of this
Yearnings (what are the primal yearnings) Helps clients transform their feelings about feelings to make change. Helps clients observe and evaluate themselves. Considers aspects of the self that the client values and aspects of which they are ashamed
Self-Compassion: Better indicator of happiness than self-esteem As self-compassion and self-worth rise, Become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses.

Ingredients of an interaction Whenever the therapist is talking with clients about difficult situations and interactions with others, they ask a series of questions. Go back to the iceberg. What do I hear and see? What is happening at the behavioral level without any interpretation. What are the meanings I make of this? What are they saying? What feelings do I have about these meanings I am making? What feelings do I have about those feelings? What defenses do I use/am I using? How does this trigger me and what kind of defensive behaviors might I bring, that makes them …. ?
What are the rules within the system about how to comment about what's going on? What is allowed and what is appropriate? How am I responding and what part do I play in the system? Facilitating emotional expression What is allowed and what is appropriate? What is my response and what am I doing in this situation?
Congruent expression, without the communication stances, turn chairs to each other directly, hold hands, make eye contact Softening family rules When families have rigid rules about who can say what, when, where, and how, she will soften some of these to create more space for everyone's particular way of communicating in a comfortable way to hopefully reduce the use of communication stances. Communication enhancement Helping each member of the family learn to communicate congruently in stressful circumstances, even when they do feel threatened by their partner or their child, Rather than reverting to a survival stance, to help them learn how to be fully congruent and present and to have more effective communications. Sculpting or spatial metaphor She would position each person in the family to metaphorically represent their role. (Example: A placator may be sculpted as being on their knees and begging, the blamer may be there pointing their finger angrily at someone, the irrelevant type might be in a strange position far off from everybody else, the super-reasonable might be sitting there in a very cold, distant, "I am citing the rulebook")
Because it is more visual than verbal - you can add a verbal element to it by having each person say a motto of theirs (eg., "Please be nice to me," "Do what I say," "Follow the rules,") - that represents their position in the family. It can push past the survival stances, intellectual defenses, the family could sculpt themselves.
It can be a powerful intervention. Touch Touch clients, help clients learn to hold and touch each other in nurturing ways, The therapist must be aware of cultures that have different attitudes towards emotional expression. The therapist adjusts to the client's level of intimacy. Used commonly in the LGBTQ community Focus is on the burden of societal rejection when being the authentic self.

Attention to individual goals reflects their humanistic foundations 2 broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Systemic/family goals
Individual goals Relational Goal: Congruent communication Communicating authentically while responding to the needs of self and others Goal to help the family develop ways for members to communicate so the system's homeostasis does not need the symptoms Overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote self-actualization Self-Actualization: Fulfilling one's potential and living an authentic and meaningful life. Specific Goal Example: Increase sense of self-worth and self-compassion
Reduce defensiveness and use of survival stances Therapists' use of self Being authentically who they are is one of the most essential interventions in Satir's approach
Creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently Ingredients of an interaction: Details the internal communication process
Teaches clients about internal and relational processes Ingredient Questions: Used to help people better understand their interactions with others
Can be used with individuals, couples, or families Walk the client through the ingredients of an interaction: What do I hear and see?
What meanings do I make of what I hear and see?
What feelings do I have about the meanings I make?
What feelings do I have about these feelings?
What defenses do I use?

Their experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. Assert their needs and desires while minimizing those of others.

Direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. Blaming (Blamer)

Discounts self, other, and context. Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. Avoidance No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Associated with most severe pathology Therapeutic Implications: Creates significant challenge for therapist
Identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality
Make the therapeutic relationship a place of upmost safety; less need for distracting communication
Increase client's ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others
Acknowledge the demands of context A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. Irrelevant (Distractor)

Super-Reasonable (Computer)
This lets you know how you sense yourself. What is the physical condition of your sense organs? What freedoms do you give yourself to look, hear, touch, taste, and smell?
Many of us were taught that we could only look at, touch, or listen to certain things. That often resulted in limiting our use of our senses. To acknowledge, honor, and fully and freely use our senses is the main way we interact with the outside world and stimulate ourselves internally. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement).canvas</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 22:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/satir's-growth-model-stages.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/satir's-growth-model-stages.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structural Family Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families usually seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions. <br>Families are organized in <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> with <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> regulating the contact family members have with one another.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure
Seeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family." Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. "Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them." Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.
Maps the family's underlying structure.
Intervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating
Enactment
Structural Mapping
Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
Boundary Making
Unbalancing
Challenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong
Pushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Family is depicted as a system that comprised of <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a>. A family is functional to the degree that it nurtures its members to negotiate well the demands of the outside world. <br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> set limits distinguishing subsystems from one another in varying permeability (from diffuse to rigid).

A set of rules governing behavior patterns
Structures typically have some form of hierarchical structure. Reciprocal and complementary functions. Parental involvement with children, over versus under involvement. Structure is expressed through transactional patterns such as: <br><a data-href="Hierarchy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchy</a> Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system.

Patterns of interaction are largely based on roles and rules. Covert coalitions are often more significant than obvious groupings.

Children are common 'symptom bearers.'

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.
The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.
The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. Theoretical Formulations: Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. But rather by a functioning structure Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. Problems arise when there are: Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions
Inflexible structures
Failure to adjust to changing circumstances Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment.

Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers'
Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple
Parental
Child/Sibling ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Structural Family Therapy/Key Terms and Concepts/Subsystem.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structure]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Structural Family Therapy/Key Terms and Concepts/Structure.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shaping]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Believed in using the resources of his clients and designing a 'strategy for each specific problem.'
He did not care about perspective (insight) as long as their actions produced beneficial results. Conducted therapy by paying extreme attention to details of symptoms his clients presented. IN therapy: Accepted and emphasized positive
Used indirect and ambiguously worded directives.
Directed routine behaviors so that the resistance is shown through change and not through normal and continuous actions. The MRI Model, Milan Model, and Haley and Madanes all overlap.

Generating change rather than generating insight. Circumventing resistance rather than dealing directly with it. People are always communicating.
All behavior is communicative
One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. Report = CONTENT = Information = WHAT IS SAID
Command = PROCESS = Underlying Relationship = HOW IT IS SAID Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life. BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as, how they view the problem, themselves, and each other. Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients being to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (positive feedback loops) that maintain an impasse. The rules or regularities of family interaction that operate to preserve family stability. The conservation aspect of family systems (similar to cybernetic concept of negative feedback). When a specific behavior within a system changes. When the rules of a system change. Rules are typically unspoken, and govern most behavior. When rules promote rigid attempted solutions, it isn't just the behavior, but the rule needs to change. <br>When a specific behavior within a system changes = <a data-href="First-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">First-Order Change</a>
<br>When the rules of the system change = <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> Families are stuck in a spiraling positive feedback loop. They make common sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums. The job is simply to get the family moving again. Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. MRI: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. Haley: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around). Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. MRI Group: Carefully defining the presenting problem and figuring out why it is perpetuated. Non-historic and symptom focused. Haley and Madanes: Examine behavioral sequences around the problem. Examine structural anomalies (weak parental hierarchies, cross-generational coalitions) Milan Group: Preliminary hypothesis tested using circular questioning (systemic explanations). Find the most motivated person in the system. Gain clear understanding of problem (symptom).
"What will be the first signs that things are getting better?"
Inquire about attempted solutions. Observe and interrupt problem-maintaining sequences. Use therapeutic paradox. Family encourages depressed member to be sad so he feels less guilt for not being happy. The solution is to deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it should not be. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. Haley joins and interviews the entire family. Social Stage -&gt; Problem Stage -&gt; Interaction Stage -&gt; Goal-Setting Stage -&gt; Task-Oriented Stage Each family member should speak and introduce themselves. Therapist should ensure problems are not discussed until everyone can speak. Therapist should examine family seating arrangements to assess organization. Keep conclusions tentative. Shift to the therapy stage. Inquire why the family is there and what the problem is. Be general and ambiguous so the family can expand. Respect the family hierarchy to gain cooperation. Treat those who have power and influence in the family with respect. Therapist should not share observations with the family. Therapist should think of the problems in terms of more than one person. It is critical family members interact with one another rather than with the therapist. Therapist should redirect family members toward each other. Assess family organization through interactions. Families need to define desired changes. Therapist can act as wise advisor and assist the family in setting goals. Use of directives (interventions aimed at targeting and changing specific behaviors). Pre-Session, Session, Intersession, Intervention, Post-Session Discussion
Positive connotation (reframing without blaming)
Circular questioning
Team approach (Reflecting team, greek chorus)
Neutrality Responsible for guidance of treatment. We are going to focus on what the problem is. Be aware of timing and pacing. Meet client where they are. Take the time (to form treatment plans) Respond to subtle pressure from clients. Avoid attempting interventions prematurely. Gather enough data about where the client is at before making attempts at intervention. Use of Qualifying Language: "I have a suggestion to make, but I am not sure how much it will accomplish. It will depend on your ability to use your imagination..." Getting client to be specific. Taking one-downmanship. The inherent power difference in therapy Determining the format of meeting. Individual vs. Conjoint
In what situation will individual session be beneficial? 'Window Shopper' Client: Re-negotiate contract
Working with the complainant
Get them down to business Restrictive Client: Ask permission to redirect
Setting specific boundary Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist to understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Never tell client why we do this. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about.
Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed they are instructed to make a list of all of the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. "The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation." (Piercy et al., 1996)
Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: "Who makes you depressed?"
"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/strategic-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Strategic Family Therapy/Strategic Family Therapy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Second-Order Change]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Covert messages are used in the struggle for control that characterizes many relationships
Symptoms represent an incongruence between levels of communication Since symptomatic behavior wasn’t reasonable, Haley didn’t try to reason with patients to help them Defined therapy as a directive form of treatment and acknowledged his debt to Milton Erickson, with whom he studied hypnosis. In what he called brief therapy, Haley zeroed in on the context and possible function of a patient’s symptoms. therapist is directing patients to do precisely what they would do anyway and thus subtly gaining the upper hand
The decisive techniques in brief therapy were directives it isn’t enough to explain problems to patients; what counts is getting them to do something about them. paradox here is that you can’t accidentally make a mistake if you are doing so deliberately

Making Contact When are you able to make authentic contact as Satir describes? Describe relationships in which you feel most authentic and able to fully connect with another. Why does this connection matter? What helps you to 'make contact' with others?

What contexts or situations are most likely to trigger you to feel unsafe and revert to your survival stance? In what contexts have you learned to maintain congruent communication even when you feel threatened? (<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/books/@gehartmasteringcompetenciesfamily2017.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017</a>) <br><a data-href="Six Levels of Experience" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/six-levels-of-experience.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Six Levels of Experience</a> With a partner or on your own, identify a recent stressful event that made you feel strong negative emotion of some kind.

Do you see any new options? <br>Building <a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> <br><a data-href="@satirNewPeoplemaking1988" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/literature/@satirnewpeoplemaking1988.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@satirNewPeoplemaking1988</a> Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. Other Stop reading for a few minutes and think about some families you know that would fit the description “troubled.” Did the family you grew up in have some of these characteristics: Was your family at times cold, deadening, super polite, secretive, confusing? What are the characteristics of the family you are living in now? Can you discover any signs of trouble that you haven’t been aware of before?
Can you think of a family that you would call nurturing at least part of the time? Can you remember a time recently when your family could be described as nurturing? Try to remember how it felt to be in your family then. Do these times happen often?
Invite your family members to try the following experiment with you. Take a partner, then tell one another your feelings ("Right now, I feel scared/tight/embarrassed/happy/etc."). Each partner simply thanks the other without judging or commenting. You thus hear one another's feelings so you can know each other better. We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. Practice as much as you can with people you trust. Now, tell each other what makes you each feel low, or high. You may find new dimensions to the people you have been living with all these years and feel closer or more real to them as a result. When you have finished the exercise, give yourself permission to share what happened for you.
Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication). Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued? Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Take a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon. The topic is “What new has been happening to me lately?” Everyone has a chance to share, not just the children. Leadership can rotate among the members. Don’t forget the celebration party afterward. You will probably find these times can be very enjoyable. You might try creating a funny or romantic theme, for instance. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/self-of-the-therapist-reflections.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Self of the Therapist Reflections.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Satir wrote one of the first books about family therapy, Conjoint Family Therapy, in which she provided transcripts of how she worked. Every person has resources available to them, but when troubled, they do not usually utilize these resources to their utmost abilities.

Each part is interconnected. The less these 8 areas are given energy and time, the lower a person's self-esteem. <br>When people experience low self-esteem, they attempt to cope by using <a data-href="Survival Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Survival Stances</a>. These stances help people temporarily deal with presumed threats and protect their self-worth. The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive. The four survival stances are: <br><a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>: Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context.

To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.

Focuses on the rules rather than on emotions and relationships. Very data driven and people appreciate them for their intellect. To offset their internal vulnerability, the super-reasonable person doesn't allow themselves to connect with any emotions. This can lead to a rigidness that may be displayed via obsessive-compulsive behaviors. <br><a data-href="Irrelevant (Distractor)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a>: Discounts self, other, and context. Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. <br>The goal of Satir's therapy is to help people enhance their own and others' self-esteem. When we do so, we function from a <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication stance. This is the healthiest position we can operate from. The Satir Growth Model is a strength-based approach, focusing on the existing resources that family members bring with them. Faulty coping strategies maintain problematic interactions. Therapy provides a safe space for people to choose alternative ways of coping. Therapy increases people's self-esteem, leading them to be able to lean into their uniqueness and provide a space for their loved ones to feel comfortable in their own uniqueness as well. Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic. (Congruence) Self-Esteem Maintenance Kit: Detective Hat: Used when there is something new that the person wants to understand better. It helped them shift away from judging an experience to exploring it. Medallion: Two-sided and says 'yes' on one side and 'no' on the other. It is intended to help the person recognize that they can say either word, depending on what they truly want, so they can maintain their integrity. Wand (Empowering wand, courage stick, wishing wand): Helps people move from inaction based on fear to action based on desire. Golden Key: Opens any door - helping the person ask questions they might not have previously, so the unsayable, and do the undoable. Wisdom Box: Helps connect the person to the wider world and all that has come before them. <br>Experiential therapists are interactive in the therapy room. They try to use their whole self for contact. This includes adopting an <a data-href="I-Thou Perspective" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">I-Thou Perspective</a>, where they try to promote human-to-human interaction. Since one of the main goals of therapy is to help the client become more congruent, it is important for the therapist to engage the client congruently. The therapist must be a real person who helps model a way of being for the client. Experiential therapists conceptualize a few main processes: Status Quo: The family is currently in this process, and is leading to difficulties bringing them to therapy. Foreign Element: The family's expression of the desire to change. Chaos: The therapist's introduction of novelty into the system. Integration: Family members put what they learn from therapy into practice. Practice: Involves trying out these learnings. New Status Quo:
- New homeostasis takes hold.<br>

Therapy then helps people to allow others to be more authentic. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Sculpting helps people get in touch with their inner experience and express this experience to others in a way that bypasses the typical spoken word. Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways: The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another. <br><a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a>: Designed to help an individual connect better to the historical and psychological interconnections of their family.

The therapist ('guide') begins the family reconstruction by telling the star's story; then sculpts the family of origin, the star's parents' families of origin, and the star's parents' relationship; and then resculpts the star's family of origin. The overall goal is to increase the star's self-esteem so they are empowered to engage with themselves and others in new and more productive ways. This should engender more hope in them for their future. <br><a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>: Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes. "The Growth Model," where the focus was on helping people access their inner resources as opposed to, "The Medical Model," where the emphasis was on pathology and symptom reduction. <br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. "The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341) Her goals for family therapy included helping the individual members increase their sense of worth and value by accessing their inner resources and by decreasing any emotional blocks. And for the family as a whole, she saw the goal as being to increase congruent communication and heart connections. She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.
It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
It is not okay to ask for what you want.
It is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: "What do you see going on between your and your ?"
"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family." <br>She also helped them to make better connections with each other by decreasing their defensiveness. Satir identified the primary defensive stances as <a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a>, <a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>, <a data-href="Distracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distracting</a>, and being <a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>.

Emotionally Withdrawing (Physically present but not emotionally present.)
Physically Withdrawing (Leaving the room or hanging up on someone.)
Cutting-Off (Refusing to talk to the other for days or longer.) Within a family system, these defenses can be played out in interactional patterns such as: Blame - Blame
Blame - Withdraw
Placate - Placate
Blame - Placate
Blame - Distract
Withdraw - Withdraw Satir developed a process for helping people change and become more connected. Her process is described as having six phases: Phase 1 - Making Contact Satir would reach out using her body position, eye contact, and facial expression to make contact with each member. She would also consciously work to connect from her spirit to theirs. Phase 2 - Validating Satir worked to help people feel validated in many ways such as reflecting their feelings, affirming their values and highlighting their inner resources. Examples include: "You feel scared because your son got suspended from school."
"You value education."
"You are courageous to seek help." Phase 3 - Facilitating Awareness Satir had many different ways that she would attempt to bring awareness to a family about their defensive patterns in a non-blaming way. <br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>: Satir placed the members in body positions to give them a picture of their defensive behavior. For the blaming stance, she would position the person leaning toward another and pointing at them and for the placating stance, she would position the person down on one knee with their head down and their hand up in a pleading position. Satir would also bring awareness to members by exploring their inner experiences. She used the metaphor of an iceberg to help the family therapist to conceptualize the inner level so experience driving defensive behaviors. Above the water line were the inner levels of experience such as feelings, perceptions, expectations, beliefs, and yearnings. (What meaning are you giving to what your ___ said that is causing you to feel hurt? Is that a familiar place for you to go to when someone is disappointed in you? What is it you yearn for?) Phase 4 - Promoting Acceptance One of the ways that satir promoted acceptance was through 'normalizing,' that is, reassuring the family member that what they were experiencing was normal. ("It is normal to...")
Another way that she promoted acceptance was by 'bridging' between conflicting parties. ("I am hearing that is is not easy for _, I would be interested to know how life was for you when you were their age?") Phase 5 - Eliciting Positive Choices and Changes Once Satir observed that the family members were aware of and accepting of their unhelpful patterns, she would lead them into seeing new possibilities for their interactions. After sculpting the family, she would ask them to each to stand in a balanced way and look at each other. She would then guide them in a dialogue helping them to express themselves in non-defensives ways. Other times she would simply have them sit face to face and she would guide the dialogue between them. "What happens for you when your says you choose over your ? You feel... Did you know that your felt __? What happened for you when you heard them express their feelings? You long to be more connected with them. You miss them. How do you feel to hear how much they miss you?" Phase 6 - Reinforcing Change Satir would often combine verbal responses with some supportive touch to reinforce a positive shift. The therapist also needs to work on their own personal growth. This is true for working with individuals but it is even more true when working with families as the chances of being triggered by your own family experience are even greater. As Satir used to say, "You are the most important instrument in the room!" Under threat and reward, change is painful: change is viewed as unnatural, the unknown is feared, the status quo is maintained, life's natural 'flow' is blocked, and the familiar is valued despite discomfort. The seed model has people viewing change more positively; as naturally occurring at a variety of levels (from cellular to cosmic) and as scary, but offering new opportunities. Discomfort is seen as a signal for change. Therapists using the seed model keep in mind that families entering therapy are problem-focused and will maintain the status quo as a necessary survival behavior. Therapist should make contact with each person to communicate a climate of acceptance (e.g., people do the best they can) and hear them out to discover 'what is.'
Understanding the status quo stage is essential to clarify how the change process gets started or is blocked. This stage is explored further by examining resistance and readiness concepts in detail. The coin of change has resistance and readiness as its head and tail sides. Experientially, we may want to change in one moment and fear or sabotage it in the next. Then status quo is considered a trance, accounting for change resistance as well as a medium in which change may be fostered. Changing circumstances elicit shifts in perception, which in turn stimulate changes in thinking, feeling, and acting. But when circumstances shift back, behavior also reverts. Perception can appear to create change of behavior when the meaning of an event is reframed, but the underlying pattern is not altered. Altering the underlying pattern requires dealing with resistance to change. Resistance is a coping behavior intended to preserve the organism rather than obstruct change. Reframing resistance in terms of its positive intention. The way we are socialized has us, "Gradually acquiring a variety of commitments which constrain the person into following a consistent pattern of behavior." The effect is to develop a lifestyle that stabilizes the events in our lives, our interdependence of meaning of these events, and the way we define ourselves, as well as predisposing us to seek consistent situations. Experientially, change involves invoking the unfamiliar. Intellectualizing, avoiding feelings, compulsive activity, impatience about change, and dwelling in the past are all ways of dealing with the confusion by maintaining the status quo. The tasks at this stage are to cope with the threat to past security and sense of competence and self-esteem; deal with feelings of loss and longing for the past.
Conservative impulse, the will to change has to overcome an impulse to restore the past, to resist the change. Survival depends on this impulse. By stabilizing perceptions, the conservative impulse enhances the ability to learn from experience. Only when it does not fit this construct is its 'newness' experienced. <br><a data-href="Readiness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/readiness.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Readiness</a> refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>. Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain. Four patterns emerge reflecting the relative influence of these readiness factors. These patters are based on the degree of difficulty involved in making the change and the degree of responsibility the person is wiling to take for making the change. <br><a data-href="Preemptive Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preemptive Change</a>: This pattern describes 'overnight' change. The inordinate strength of the motivating influences lowers the degree of difficulty in making the change. The degree of responsibility for the change is also low. The change in circumstances preempts issues of loss (leaving family and friends), self-efficacy ("Can I do it?"), and self-esteem ("Am I worth the effort?") that are ordinarily addressed in making changes. Problems maintaining the change may require attention at a later point in the change process. Change literally 'happens' to us in this pattern, but we have little sense of ownership of it. <br><a data-href="Self-Managed Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Managed Change</a>: In this pattern, the influences motivating the change are less extreme or immediate than those noted in the preemptive patter. The person is influenced to take a conscious and self-responsible approach to change and is required to deal with one or more of the issues of loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in order to resolve the resistance to change. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP" target="_self">Satir Family Therapy - YouTube</a> Experiential family therapies include four approaches: <br><a data-href="Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)</a>

No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Must increase ability to recognize thoughts and feelings of self and others.
The focus for the therapist is on creating safety. Help them learn to recognize, and not be afraid of their thoughts and the thoughts of others. Stances acknowledge or minimize three realities: Self
Other
Context When we feel unsafe, we revert back to one of these communication stances. These are the stances used when someone is frightened. When we don't feel safe as children, we evolve communication stances to survive when we do not feel safe when we are young. You can use the communication stances to help better understand how to intervene, or how to communicate with your client. When you are working with a placator, be cautious if you are going to be making a suggestion it may help to give options. "Which do you think is the best fit or might work for you?" Ask them to give voice to their thoughts and opinions because they will be very quick even to please the therapist. Their task us to learn to assert themselves in a healthy way, how can they assert their needs so that they don't become resentful, depressed (needs do not get taken care of because they are not advocating for themselves) Therapy involves going through stages several times. Can be a new way of looking at the interactions and how to communicate in a more congruent way.

Emotional Role of Symptom Symptom has a role in the family system Example: Child's exaggerated acting out may serve to reduce tension in marriage by getting parents on the same page. If the therapist can understand how symptom makes emotional sense, it will be easier to help find ways to interact successfully. Problematic family dynamics typically involve: Power struggles
Parental conflicts
Lack of validation
Lack of intimacy Each person's role in family is assessed to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles: Martyr
Victim or helpless one
Rescuer
Good child/parent
Bad child/parent Timeline that includes major events in individual's or family's life. Births and deaths
Important family events: Marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss Important historical events: Wars, natural disasters, economic downturns Gives both the therapist and client insight into the context of the problem as well as strengths and resources might exist. Child, mother, and father and quality of relationship between them. In this primary triad a child learns how to be human. The triad should serve as nurturing system for child. When the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. Layers of the iceberg: Behavior (Top Layer)

Ingredients of an interaction Whenever the therapist is talking with clients about difficult situations and interactions with others, they ask a series of questions. Go back to the iceberg. What do I hear and see? What is happening at the behavioral level without any interpretation. What are the meanings I make of this? What are they saying? What feelings do I have about these meanings I am making? What feelings do I have about those feelings? What defenses do I use/am I using? How does this trigger me and what kind of defensive behaviors might I bring, that makes them …. ?
What are the rules within the system about how to comment about what's going on? What is allowed and what is appropriate? How am I responding and what part do I play in the system? Facilitating emotional expression What is allowed and what is appropriate? What is my response and what am I doing in this situation?
Congruent expression, without the communication stances, turn chairs to each other directly, hold hands, make eye contact Softening family rules When families have rigid rules about who can say what, when, where, and how, she will soften some of these to create more space for everyone's particular way of communicating in a comfortable way to hopefully reduce the use of communication stances. Communication enhancement Helping each member of the family learn to communicate congruently in stressful circumstances, even when they do feel threatened by their partner or their child, Rather than reverting to a survival stance, to help them learn how to be fully congruent and present and to have more effective communications. Sculpting or spatial metaphor She would position each person in the family to metaphorically represent their role. (Example: A placator may be sculpted as being on their knees and begging, the blamer may be there pointing their finger angrily at someone, the irrelevant type might be in a strange position far off from everybody else, the super-reasonable might be sitting there in a very cold, distant, "I am citing the rulebook")
Because it is more visual than verbal - you can add a verbal element to it by having each person say a motto of theirs (eg., "Please be nice to me," "Do what I say," "Follow the rules,") - that represents their position in the family. It can push past the survival stances, intellectual defenses, the family could sculpt themselves.
It can be a powerful intervention. Touch Touch clients, help clients learn to hold and touch each other in nurturing ways, The therapist must be aware of cultures that have different attitudes towards emotional expression. The therapist adjusts to the client's level of intimacy. Used commonly in the LGBTQ community Focus is on the burden of societal rejection when being the authentic self.

New Status Quo Satir's way of being in the world Unshakable hope and deep-felt respect for her clients Satir's presence in the room Put people at ease and allowed them to feel secure enough to relate to one another non-defensively This quality of being, or therapeutic presence, is difficult to define Few methods for systematically developing it More that therapists are congruent, the better they can create therapeutic warmth and humanity Satir et al., (1991) describe establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact'
Making Contact: Begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self in the self-mandala. Therapist works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other. Convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing empathy
Having empathy does NOT mean that a therapist: Takes the client's side
Avoids confronting inconsistencies
Ignores the client's responsibility Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it Makes it easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience, which is 'true' for that person Family Functioning: Role of symptom

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href="Paul Watzlawick" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href="Richard Fisch" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos.

Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?
Is each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness
<br>Accurate <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>
Unconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit
Open body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact
Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href="Role of the Symptom" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/role-of-the-symptom.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role of the Symptom</a> in the System <br>Describe how the symptom maintains the family's homeostasis at an emotional level, often regulating closeness and distance (<a data-href="Distance Regulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distance Regulation</a>; <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>) Family Dynamics Identify salient dynamics Power struggles

Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem.

Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns) This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child? Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. The six layers of the iceberg: Behavior The behavior on the surface; the external manifestations of the person's inner world.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. <br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.' The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions. The mind-body connection considers how emotional issues may manifest in the body, either symbolically or functionally.

This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relational, family, or systemic goals
Individual goals The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication: The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/in-session-diagrams/satir's-self-mandala-diagram.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/in-session-diagrams/satir's-self-mandala-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Super-Reasonable (Computer)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Discounts self, other, and context. Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. Avoidance No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
Associated with most severe pathology Therapeutic Implications: Creates significant challenge for therapist
Identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality
Make the therapeutic relationship a place of upmost safety; less need for distracting communication
Increase client's ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others
Acknowledge the demands of context A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Key Terms and Concepts/Irrelevant (Distractor).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family Life Chronology]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Was limited in its approach to families because it often did not consider the complicated nature of family systems. Based on learning theories; was aimed at parent training and couple communication. The approach is now making changes to be more adaptive to the: Complex systems imbedded in families Classical Conditioning: Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS) Food Unconditioned Response (UCR) Salivation Conditioned Stimulus (CS) Ringing Bell Systematic Desensitization De-conditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition. Operant Conditioning: Responses that are positively reinforced will be repeated more frequently
Behaviors that are punished or ignored will be reduced or extinguished <br><img alt="Positive and Negative Reinforcement.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/positive-and-negative-reinforcement.png" target="_self"> Developed behavioral parent training Behavioral approaches to couple and family therapy Introduced cognitive elements into behavioral therapy. Cognitive triangle: Thoughts -&gt; feelings -&gt; behaviors -&gt; thoughts Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
Behavior problems are caused by: Dysfunctional patterns of reinforcement between parents and children. Behavior will remain resistant to change until more rewarding consequences are introduced.
<br><a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>: People strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. Cognitive theorists emphasized the need for attitude changes to: Promote and maintain behavior change. Behavioral approaches are typically limited to two party relationships: Parent/child, spouses.
Fail to take into account the triadic nature of relationships. Cognitive techniques became more prominent as behavior therapists realized: An exclusive focus on behavior often failed to address the complicated dynamics of couple and family interaction. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Healthy families are those in which positive behaviors are maintained by: Appropriate consequences
Negative behaviors are extinguished through the use of punishment Healthy families have high rations of benefits to costs
(Philippines, there is no such thing as divorce)
Healthy couples will be able to engage in:
Effective communication skills, problem-solving skills, and conflict resolution.
Healthy families and couples could adapt, be flexible, and change. Behavioral Family Therapy: Symptoms are viewed as learned responses.
For behavioral therapists, no underlying meanings of symptoms are sought. Attention is focused on the symptoms themselves and the environmental responses that reinforce behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapists will include ideas about dysfunctional schemas: Regarding family roles and relationships that are learned in one's family-of-origin,
Cognitive Distortions: Arbitrary Inference: Conclusions are drawn in the absence of supporting evidence. Selective Abstraction: Certain details are highlighted while other important information is ignored. Overgeneralization: Isolated incidents are taken as general patterns. Magnification and Minimization: The significance of events is unrealistically magnified or diminished. Personalization: Events are arbitrarily interpreted in reference to oneself. Dichotomous Thinking: Experiences are interpreted as all good or all bad. Labeling and Mislabeling: Behavior is attributed to undesirable personality traits. Mind Reading: This is the magical gift of knowing what other people are thinking about without the aid of verbal communication. Behavior and cognitive changes in the way one behaves toward/thinks about family.
Increase the rate of rewarding interactions in family relationships.
Decrease the use of negative family interactions; increase positive interaction.
Teach effective communication and problem-solving skills.
Alter negative thought patterns; promoted or maintain ineffective family interactions. Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered.
Identify behavioral goals.
Learn techniques to achieve these goals.
Facilitate social reinforcement of change. A hallmark of behavioral therapy.
Families and couples - questionnaires and home observations are conducted. For sex therapy, clinical interviews are the main assessment tool. Treatment goals are set based on results of assessment.
2-4 sessions (About 1.5-2 hours each) Main Point: To gather information as much as possible at the beginning to form treatment plan.
Each person takes turn to respond. Gather information, perspective-taking and avoid escalation. Information Gathering: Self-report questionnaires, clinical interviews, observation of interactional patterns. Initial Conjoint Interviews (Couple): CBCT: How the couple met, what attracted them to each other, how they developed a deeper involvement, positive and negative life events, prior experiences in therapy. Initial Conjoint Interviews (Families): Inquired about the family members' current concerns and strengths of the relationship.
Orients the family to the process of therapy by describing the structure and course of CBFT and the roles of therapist and family. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment, and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals.
Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy.
Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words. Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of. The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback The agenda of therapy is educational. Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation. Didactic role early on to strike a balance between directiveness and collaboration.
Reviews homework assignments, models skills, coaches family members in practicing them, and fosters motivation.
Balances alliances and interventions with all the family members or subsystems, so that they feel supported and remain equally invested in improving relationships. Directive Role of the Therapist: Sets the pace of sessions so that the goals of treatment are addressed in a timely and sequential fashion. Sets the agenda each session.
Monitors the use of time.
Responsible to stay on task and address the goals of session.
Teaches the clients to self-monitor as well. Maintains control of the session with confidence and credibility.
Assumes multiple roles: Director, educator, facilitator, collaborator, advocate Balances the alliance and interventions with all members, so they feel supported and invested. Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions.
Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interaction patterns with new ones, families need to rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints.
Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement.
Couples are helped to improve their communication.
Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making.
Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Imagery
Roleplay
Coaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)
Communication training: For example, engaging in an argument without attacking, 'I-statements', and Speaker/Listener exercises Problem-solving training
Homework Assignments
Mindfulness and Meditation Parents have control over the rewards and punishment of children. If parents change the contingencies of reinforcement, the child's behavior will change. Skills are taught in sequence (shaping).
Help parents define the child's positive and problematic behaviors in specific observable actions.
Tracking target behaviors.
Reinforcing desired behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts.
Disciplinary techniques include time out, ignoring problem behavior. Observe/Assess the frequency of problem behavior, what precedes it, and what reinforcement follows (Behavior Chaining)
Shaping (reinforcing small steps toward change)
Token economies (reward good behavior)
Contingency contracting (agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their child)
Time out

When they first began working with families, behavior therapists applied learning theory to train parents in behavior modification and teach communication skills to couples. <br>The early principles of behavior therapy were developed by two key figures: <a data-href="Joseph Wolpe" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/joseph-wolpe.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joseph Wolpe</a> and <a data-href="B.

F. Skinner</a>. In 1948, Wolpe introduced systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization deconditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition by pairing responses incompatible with anxiety to previously anxiety-arousing stimuli. <br>Skinner's <a data-href="Operant Conditioning" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/operant-conditioning.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Operant Conditioning</a>: Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.
The operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Skills taught in sequence.

According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania. The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. <br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy. Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. <br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href="Schemas" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone. Hidden assumptions have a potent impact on how people perceive and react to each other. <br><a data-href="Behavior Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/behavior-exchange-theory.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavior Exchange Theory</a>: A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control. A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills. Neil Jacobson (1981): Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. Attention is a powerful social reinforcer. The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)
Even when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.
Others persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. <br>The use of <a data-href="Aversion Control" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills. Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease') Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. <br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up. These schemas are the basis of biased assumptions that poison relationships by distorting family members' responses to each other.

Example: A husband doesn't know asks his wife what she wants because he 'knows what's going on in her mind' Cognitive restructuring is useful to the extent that it leads to changed behavior, which can be reinforced. The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Consists of reinforcing change in small steps. <br><a data-href="Token Economy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/token-economy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Token Economy</a>: Use points to reward children for good behavior. <br><a data-href="Contingency Contracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-contracting.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Contracting</a>: Agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their children. <br><a data-href="Contingency Management" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-management.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Management</a>: Giving and taking away rewards based on children's behavior. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a>: Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior. S for stimulus
O for the state of the organism
R for the target response
KC for the contingency of consequences Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. <br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href="Premack Principle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premack Principle</a> is applied. High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting. Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.
Case Study: Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind. The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession. The most widely used in the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale, a 23-item questionnaire covering various aspects of marital satisfaction, including communication, sex, affection, social activities, and values. Assessments are designed to reveal strengths and weaknesses of a couple's relationship and the manner in which rewards and punishments are exchanged. Interviews and questionnaires are used to specify and elaborate target behaviors. Jacobson's (1981) Pretreatment Assessment for Marital Therapy: Strengths and skills of the relationship: What are the major strengths of this relationship?
What behaviors on the part of each spouse are highly valued by the other?
What shared activities does the couple currently engage in? Presenting Problems: What are the major complaints, and how do these complaints translate into explicit behavioral terms?
What are the reinforcers maintaining these behaviors?
What behaviors occur at less than the desired frequency or fail to occur at appropriate times from the standpoint of each spouse?
What are the consequences of these behaviors currently, when they occur? Sex and Affection: Is either spouse currently dissatisfied with rate, quality, or diversity of sex life together?
If sex is currently a problem, was there a time when it was mutually satisfying?
What are the sexual behaviors that seem to be associated with current dissatisfaction?
Are either or both partners dissatisfied with the amount or quality of nonsexual physical affection? Future Prospects: Are the partners seeking therapy to improve their relationship, to separate, or to decide whether the relationship is worth working on?
What are each spouse's reasons for continuing the relationship despite the current problems? Assessment of Social Environment: What are each person's alternatives to the present relationship?
How attractive are these alternatives to each person?
Is the environment (parents, relatives, friends, work associates, children) supportive of either continuance or dissolution of present relationship? Individual Functioning of Each Spouse: Does either spouse exhibit emotional or behavioral problems?
Have they been in therapy before, either alone or together? What kind of therapy? Outcome?
What is each spouse's past experience with intimate relationships?
How is the present relationship difference? Richard Stuart (1975) lists five strategies that summarize the behavioral approach to troubled marriages: Couples are taught to express themselves in a clear, behavior descriptions rather than in vague complaints.
Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations. Treatment that emphasizes attitude change as well as reinforcement of behavior. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Cognitive-Behavioral Family Therapy (CBT)/Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Triangulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[ Detouring conflict between two people by involving a third person, stabilizing the relationship between the original pair.

(<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/books/@nicholsfamilytherapyconcepts2019.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019</a>) <br>
The concept of multigenerational transmission process describes how small differences in the levels of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> between parents and their offspring lead over many generations to marked differences in differentiation among the members of an extended family. The information creating these differences is transmitted across generations through relationships. The transmission occurs in several interconnected levels, ranging from the conscious teaching and learning of information to the automatic and unconscious programming of emotional reactions and behaviors. Relationally and genetically transmitted information interact to shape an individual's 'self.' The combination of parents actively shaping the development of their offspring, offspring inately responding to their parents' moods, attitudes, and actions, and the long dependency period of human offspring results in people's developing levels of differentiation of self similar to their parents'. However, the relationship patterns of nuclear family emotional systems often result in at least one member of a sibling group developing a little more 'self' and another member developing a little less 'self' than the parents. People predictably select mates with levels of differentiation of self that match their own. Therefore, if one offspring's level of 'self' is higher than the parents' and another is lower, one offspring's marriage is more differentiated and the other's marriage is less differentiated than the parents' marriage. If each offspring then has a child who is more differentiated and a child who is less differentiated than himself, one three generational line becomes progressively more differentiated (the most differentiated child of the most differentiated offspring) and one line becomes progressively less differentiated (the least differentiated child of the least differentiated offspring). As these processes repeat over multiple generations, the differences between family lines grow increasingly marked. Levels of differntiation of self can affect longevity, marital stability, reproduction, health, educational accomplishments, and occupational successes. This impact of differentiation on overall life functioning explains the marked variation that typically exists in the lives of the members of a multigenerational family. The highly differentiated people have unusually stable nuclear families and contribute much to society. The poorly differentiated people have chaotic personal lives and depend heavily on others to sustain them. A key implication of the multigenerational concept is that the roots of the most severe human problems, as well as of the highest levels of human adaptation, are generations deep. The multigenerational transmission process not only programs the levels of 'self' people develop but also how people interact with others. Both types of programming affect the selection of a spouse For example, if a family programs someone to atta ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/multigenerational-transmission-process.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/Key Terms and Concepts/Multigenerational Transmission Process.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fusion]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Questionnaires The mental status examination is a structured assessment of the patient's behavioral and cognitive functioning. In general, the components of a mental status exam include descriptions of the following: Appearance: Casual dress, normal grooming and hygiene. Attitude: Calm and cooperative General Behavior: Unusual movements or psychomotor changes Speech and Language: Normal rate/tone/volume and without pressure Emotions: Reactive and mood congruent, labile, tearful, blunted, normal range, depressed, constricted, flat Mood: Euthymic, irritable, elevated, anxious, depressed Thought and Perception: Goal-directed and logical or disorganized
Suicidal ideation: passive, active, plan?
Homicidal ideation: passive, active plan?
Hallucinations or delusions during interview Cognition
Orientation: oriented to time, place, person, self Biopsychosocial Model: “Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 10.25.48 AM.png” could not be found.
A Biopsychosocial Assessment is an assessment typically conducted by therapists at the beginning of therapy, which assesses for biological, psychological, and social factors that can be contributing to a problem or problems with a client. Biopsychosocial Assessments enable therapist to diagnose and effectively treat clients. Tasks and Process of Assessment: Make Initial Contact
Develop a collaborative therapeutic relationship
Use a bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual assessment: Person-in-Environment
Defining problems
Assessing safety
Accessing and appreciating patient/clients' strengths
Assess systems collaboration issues and strengths
Expand awareness and perspectives
Assess goals Biopsychosocial Assessment Areas: Demographic Information (Age, Ethnicity, Religion, Relational Status, Referral Status, etc.)
History of the Presenting Problem
Psychiatric History
Trauma History
Family Psychiatric History
Medical History
Medication Use
Substance Use
Family History (Family of Origin, Relationship with Parents, Siblings, etc.)
Social History
Spiritual/Cultural Factors
Developmental History
Educational/Vocational History
Legal History
SNAP (Strength, Needs, Abilities, Preferences)
Other Important Information Guiding Principles for Assessment: A systemic view: Everything is connected Foundational importance of bio-physiological, psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual domains in relation to multiple service systems
A strengths-based perspective
Assessment as an ongoing process Regular screening and tracking during sessions of the following: Health status
Mobility
Wellness Exercise
Nutrition
Sleep Ensure that client has primary care physician
Communicate with primate care physician or other health providers as needed. General Psychological Issues: Cognitive skills and ability (e.g.. thought process, problem-solving/decision-making skills)
Behavioral skills
Emotional competencies: Affect regulation
Capacity for relating Motivational factors Overall mental status
Risk Assessment
Specific Mental Health Concerns: Depression
Anxiety
Substance Use Appropriate referral if needed
Ongoing communication between external providers (collaboration of care) Risk Assessment includes consideration of psychological and social factors as part of a comprehensive review to capture client needs, and to assess their risk of harm to themselves or others. Assessments often aim to categorize patients as at high, medium, or low risk
Examples of risk areas include: Suicidal ideation
Homicidal ideation
Child abuse/neglect
Intimate partner violence
Physical health issues or crises Inability to care for self or others Animal abuse
Substance abuse Important factors: Level of risk
Intent to act
Plan to act
Means to act
Risk and protective factors Assessing Strengths: Personal and Relational Strengths: Bio-physiological
Psychological
Sociocultural
Spiritual 'Strengths' of the problem/symptoms
Strengths in systems collaboration Exploring the 'Strengths' and Potential 'Contributions' of the Problem When was the last time that you realized that the problem was helpful to you?
If your problem has a voice, what do you think it is trying to share or communicate with you?
How might the problem be helpful to you?
If we could get rid of the problem, what might be some aspect of it that you might want to retain? Useful Questions for Assessing Strengths: What has been helpful so far?
What are some of your successes?
What are the achievements that you are most proud of having accomplished?
What little things are you doing that make life a little better for you?
What kinds of things do people compliment you on?
When have you stopped doing something that was difficult for you to stop?
When have you made an important change in your life that was difficult to make?
When have you broken a habit that was hard to break? Outcomes of Assessment: Problems: Bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual perspective
Problem and attempted solutions specifically and behaviorally described (SOLVABLE). Goals: Desired future outcomes
Specifically and behaviorally described (ATTAINABLE)
Professional and the patient/client mutually agree to the described problems and goals. Treatment plan and interventions based on mutual consensus of problem and goal David A. Jobes, Ph.D. Creator of CAMS Framework Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) It is a therapeutic framework for suicide-specific assessment and treatment of a patient's suicidal risk. It is a flexible approach that can be used across theoretical orientations and disciplines for a wide range of suicidal patients across treatment settings and different treatment modalities. Every session of CAMS intentionally utilizes the patient's input about what is and is not working. All assessment work in CAMS is collaborative. The clinician's honesty and forthrightness are key elements. The CAMS clinician endeavors to understand their patient's suffering from an empathic, nonjudgemental, and intra-subjective perspective. The clinician never shames or blames a suicidal person for being suicidal. Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments for Suicide: Three evidence-based (randomized controlled trials) interventions and treatments that are designed to directly target suicide at risk. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT): Suicide Prevention (CT-SP) and Brief CBT. Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) Suicide-Specific Brief Interventions: Evidence-Based (Random Controlled Trial): Teachable Moment Brief Intervention (TMBI): A one-time intervention 2 dats after an attempt. Motivational Interviewing: In-patient settings Crisis Response Planning &amp; Safety Planning (6 Steps)
Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP): 3 Sessions in-patient settings Malpractice Liability, Competent Practice, and Cases of Suicide: Know the three 'pillars' for reducing malpractice liability (i.e. malpractice wrongful death torts): Foreseeability:

Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people. Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. People are always communicating. All behavior is communicative. One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions Report = Content = information = (What is said)
Command = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life
BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.
Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions Go slow
Engage in behavior they want to eliminate What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. <br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. <br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop.

Centerpiece of the model
Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it. Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. What often needs to happen? Reverse the solution! <br><a data-href="Paradoxical Injunction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/paradoxical-injunction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paradoxical Injunction</a>: <br>A technique used in <a data-href="Strategic Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/strategic-family-therapy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Strategic Family Therapy</a> whereby the therapist directs family members to continue their symptomatic behavior.

Structural: Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies. Functional: Problems result when people try to protect or control one another covertly, so that their symptoms serve a function for the system. Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. The job is simply to get the family moving again.
Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. In pushing family members to set concrete goals, they are forced to clarify vague dissatisfactions. The primary goal is behavior change. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. <br><a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. <br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around) Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. Define a resolvable complaint. Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. Who sees it as a problem?
Why is it a problem now? "What is the problem that brings you here today?" is too vague. Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. The solution is part of the problem.
Prescribe some alternative behavior!
The key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. MRI Approach: Introduction to the treatment setup
Inquiry and definition of the problem
Estimation of the behavior maintaining the problem
Setting goals for treatment
Selecting and making behavioral interventions
Termination Attempted solutions: The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories: When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT
When clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING
When clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. Paradoxical interventions: The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s). Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. Restraining technique: Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different. Co-founded the Family Therapy Institute of Washington D.C. (1974)

Emphasize short term treatment (10 sessions) Define a problem clearly
Investigating all solutions that have previously been tried
Defining a clear and concrete change to be achieved
Formulating and implementing a strategy for change Therapists must be innovative
Therapy must be customizable to families (technique driven)
If families are going to change, alterations in ways their members act must precede new perceptions or feelings
Focus on interpersonal payoff of psychiatric symptoms Social Stage: Introduction and setup
Help everyone relax, greet each family member, make sure everyone is comfortable. Problem Stage: Definition of the problem in clear behavioral terms
Ask each individual for their perspective, speak to the less involved parent/partner first to get their involvement, listen carefully to the way each family member describes the problem, make sure no one interrupts until each has a turn, make observations. Emphasize the use of directives.
If therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. Interaction Stage: Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem
Encourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another? Goal Setting Stage Providing directives
Give the family a task, directives Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. "The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation." For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: "Who makes you depressed?"
"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. Example: A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent. Mandanes talked about how one relationship may metaphorically replicate another and power struggles in couples (money, education, control of children, etc.) Negotiation (pg. 90)

Pretend techniques (pg. 91)
Ordeals (pg. 91) Hayley believed that telling people what they're doing wrong only mobilizes resistance. Changes in behavior alter perceptions. Milan group was interested in getting families to see things differently through (reframe) positive connotation. Which then gets family members to behave differently. Shift from behavior to cognition set stage for constructivist/narrative movements. Families should have clear generational boundaries. Therapists should be 'neutral' and not have expectations for families. Therapy helps the family by simply examining the family, asking questions to help them examine their own family structure, and exposing games after which they can redesign their family into a better structure on their own. <br><a data-href="Mara Selvini Palazzoli" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/mara-selvini-palazzoli.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mara Selvini Palazzoli</a>

Session: Validate, modify, and change the hypothesis. Intersession: Team discussion of hypothesis and arrival at an intervention. Intervention: Delivery of the intervention to the family.

Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. Set minimum goals for change. Investigate solutions to the complaints. Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'
Understand clients' preferred views. Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'
Nurture and solidify initial change. Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)
Therapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)
Co-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)
Late in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?
I don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. Define a resolvable complaint. Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint Who is doing what?
If I had a video of this, what would I see? Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?
Determine a minimum change goal What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem: What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?
What happens after these attempted solutions? Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like: What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution? The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions: How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?
What do they hold near and dear?
When are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?
What is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?
Whose idea was it to come? Why now?
Who is most optimistic that therapy will help? How will you know the situation is improving?
What kinds of change will you settle for?
What will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?
What will each of you settle for? Therapeutic restraint: Telling clients to 'go slow'
Cautioning them about the dangers of improvement
Giving insturctions about how to make the problem worse Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. Identify problem-solution feedback loops: Demand-Refuse
Discuss-Acoid
Criticize-Defend
Accuse-Deny Encourage the family to do less of the same: When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. <br><a data-href="Reframing" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reframing</a>: For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. Acknowledging (Reinforcing): When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. Predicting or Prescribing: Exploring the dangers of movement. Therapeutic restraint / going slow
Prescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting
Jamming / experiment
Reframing
Less of the same
Acknowledge / reinforce Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on: Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing. Applicable to any family that presents with a clear complaint. Particularly relevant for families that seem resistance to change.

The onset and diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders occurs in childhood. These disorders rarely experience a remission or relapse and are considered to be a stable set of symptoms over time, and thus neurodevelopmental disorders appear throughout the individual's life span. Bipolar disorder affects and is affected by the family system and successful treatment is enhanced when family embers understand the course and treatment of the illness, respond in supportive ways, and stay patient and empathetic within the context of constructive communication and problem-solving. Bipolar Disorder takes a significant toll on personal efficacy and self-worth and is often bewildering to family members as they try to manage the symptoms of the illness and support their affected loved ones in the midst of frustrating and competing interpersonal, social, and logistical factors. The emergence of Bipolar Disorder as manifested by intense periods of mania, often followed by periods of deep depression, disrupts peace, tests relationships, clouds future dreams and aspirations, and often destroys marriage and family relationships. The presence of mania (As manifest in Bipolar I Disorder) or hypomania (As manifested in Bipolar II Disorder), which is a state of intense, energized mood, cognition, and behavior, resulting in an increased capacity for creativity and clarity of thought (Rational and irrational), rapid ideas and racing thoughts, sometimes irritability and impatience with others, reduced need for sleep, distractibility, and objective-focused activity, and/or energy present most of the time during the episode. With mania and hypomania, there is a decreased need for sleep, increased sexual desire, and a need for stimulation, which can involve risk-taking behaviors resulting in painful and/or harmful consequences. The subjective experience of mania is also characterized as paradoxical where there is a lightning-fast epiphany beyond the vision of all others, which produces a feeling of grandiosity and power. Many who experience mania describe feeling frustrated at their limited capacity to experience and carry forward these creative insights, like drinking water from a fire hose. Mania, but not hypomania, is also sometimes accompanied by delusional thinking and psychosis, which mimic symptoms of <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. Hypomania contains similar symptoms manifest in mania, but of a lesser duration and lesser intensity, and is a characteristic of Bipolar II Disorder. The most frightening time for those experiencing mania is when it begins to dissipate because for many it signals the descent into depression. Another complex manifestation of depression is Bipolar With Mixed Episodes. These depressive episodes are characterized by deep sadness, hopelessness, feelings of emptiness, fatigue, lack of energy, loss of appetite, listlessness, dysphoria, and apathy for a minimum of 2 weeks. Depressive episodes are often attended by shame and embarrassment for the consequence of manic actions, a lack of pleasure in activities once enjoyable, the need to isolate from others, a sense of worthlessness, guilt, stomach aches and pains, troubled sleep, and thoughts of death. Whereas in mania, the risk of death is typically from thrill seeking, in depressed individuals, the primary risk of death is suicide. Many who suffer from bipolar depression describe the subjective feeling of depression as intense as is the feeling of mania. Mania is characterized as the 'highest of highs' whereas depression is characterized by the 'lowest of lows.'
Suicide is a very real concern for the bipolar client, family, and friends, and those treating bipolar persons. In the course of antidepressant of bipolar disorder, or depression, the first symptoms that respond to treatment are a lack of energy (i.e., people become more energized) and sleep (i.e., people tend to sleep between when on antidepressants), and one of the last symptoms to clear up is mood. This makes people with Bipolar Disorder especially susceptible to suicide because they actually have the energy to kill themselves. States of high energy along with depression increase suicidal risk. <br>The <a data-href="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-of-mental-disorders-(dsm).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</a> categorizes Bipolar and Related Disorders as: Bipolar I Disorder: Characterized by a manic episode lasting 7 days or longer Bipolar II Disorder: Characterized by a hypomanic episode lasting no more than 4 days. Cyclothymic Disorder: Characterized by hypomanic symptoms that would not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a hypomanic 'episode' and depressive symptoms that would not meet the full symptom criteria for a depressive 'episode.' This includes a lower level of intensity of both extremes, a lower level of frequency with symptoms occurring for 4 days compared to 7 days for a manic episode, and a subthreshold of symptoms necessary to meet the disorder. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder: Characterized by symptoms of mania precipitated by a particular medication or substance (e.g., illicit or prescribed) and Bipolar Disorder Related to a Medical Condition, in which symptoms of mania can be precipitated by a health-related condition. Mania becomes the primary symptom distinguishing Bipolar Disorder from other depressive disorders and causes significant 'impairment in social and occupational functioning,' as well as a disruption to family relationships and functioning, which is the general standard that distinguishes problematic behavior from a mental disorder. Prevalence rates for all Bipolar Disorders for adults are 3.9% over the lifetime with 2.6% of the adult population meeting diagnostic criteria in a given year and 2.5% of adolescents meeting them over the lifetime with 2.2% of the population meeting criteria in a given year. Approximately 1.7% of adolescents report having mania along during the lifetime, and 1.3% report having manic symptoms in a given year. 50% to 67% of adults reported the onset of Bipolar Disorder before the age of 18 and 15% to 28% reported experiencing symptoms before 13 years. There is some evidence suggesting that women experience Bipolar II Disorder at a higher rate. Women also tend to experience higher 'rapid cycling' (i.e., four or more mood episodes within a single year) and more 'mixed states' (i.e., mixed symptoms or 'features' of mania and depression within a single episode) than men. Bipolar Disorder with Mixed Features is especially difficult to treat with psychotropic medication because of the nature of simultaneous manic and depressive symptoms. There is a hereditary component in Bipolar Disorder, 'A family history of Bipolar Disorder is one of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for Bipolar Disorders.'
Over 90% of those experiencing a manic episode eventually have recurring episodes and roughly 60% of individuals having a manic episode also have a depressive episode, so the likelihood is high that mania persists within individuals with multiple episodes, including episodes of depression. The persistence of symptoms within the interepisode phases of the illness indicates that, for many, there is never a break within this chronic condition. Depressive episodes in the bipolar cycle are much more difficult to treat and that individuals spend much more time in depressive states than manic ones; research suggests as much as three times as many weeks during the year with depressive symptoms versus symptoms of mania. Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, often debilitating condition that requires a multifaceted treatment approach to manage effectivity.
<br>For both adults and adolescents, symptoms of Bipolar Disorder can be comorbid with a wide variety of other disorders including <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> (including specific phobias), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, serious and often untreated medical conditions, and, for adolescents, disruptive and/or conduct disorder, and 'disorders with prominent irritability.' The primary treatment of Bipolar Disorder is psychopharmacologic, and typically starts with lithium bicarbonate and other mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics and anxiolytics that are often prescribed in the acute phase of the illness. Because individuals with Bipolar Disorder often have sleep disturbance, sleep medications are often prescribed to regulate circadian rhythms. Good sleep hygiene is one of the easiest and best ways to help prevent triggering mania. The use of electroconvulsive therapy is an option for entrenched, severe, and persistent depressive symptoms. A common and frustrating feature of medication treatment for bipolar individuals is medication compliance. Individuals affected with Bipolar Disorder often find the effects of drug therapy as blunting the euphoric effects of the experience of mania, and develop abhorrence to the side effects of the medication. They are also often resistant to the idea that they will be taking medications for the rest of their lives in order to maintain a balances mood, to help them make reasoned choices, maintain their interpersonal relationships, and support systems, and lower the incidence of additional and severe episodes. Re-hospitalizations for bipolar patients was lowest in the multifamily group, and the researchers pointed to the potential that patients may have learned to see themselves as less of a burden on family members, to experience more support from others (especially their own families), to feel less isolated, and to feel enhanced hope in learning how to cope more successfully with their condition. Family and social relationships are central to the affected person's ability to live successfully with this condition. Individuals experiencing manic and depressive symptoms reflect the bewilderment, anger, hopelessness, and existential despair often felt in family members who struggle to support their impacted loved one while at the same time trying to make sense of what is difficult to accept: that their loved one has a chronic condition that will persist throughout their life and, as family members, they too travel a parallel path. The tangible consequences include being introduced into the legal system with adolescent or adult family members who may act out during a manic episode and violate the law. Other potential, practical consequences include unemployment resulting from inconsistent or poor job performance; impulsive and poor financial decisions resulting in loss of income, savings, or retirement resources; loss of social status within the community; interfacing with mental health agencies and social services and a wide variety of mental health personnel; and often being marginalized by a mental health system that does not recognize the legitimate burden family members carry and the inability to access important treatment information on behalf of their affected loved one because of right to privacy and confidentiality. Sometimes partners of spouses, sons and daughters of parents, and parents of children may cut off and/or leave or divorce the impacted relative because of the stress attendant to this condition. These life disruptions cast a pall on other family and social activities and center the collective energy and family resources on addressing the problem. It is difficult to maintain hope in the future under these conditions. The intangible or emotional fallout for the family is a real and felt experience and centers on working to accept the disorder and attendant consequences. When an affected individual is in a manic state, family members may initially find the observed behavior as interesting or exciting, but soon turn to distress and anxiety as their loved one becomes more impulsive, unpredictable, and erratic; the family member may leave and not return home for days. If the manic episode is new to family members, there is often confusion about how to respond and about the immediate need for perspective. Often, family members seek to discern differences between the illness and the characteristics of the affected loved one in an attempt to make sense of their behaviors. If the affected individual is a parent, children and other family members need reassurance; if a child, parents may seek to discipline or reason with their loved one with little success. Some become violent, destructive, and/or manifest delusional and psychotic symptoms that are frightening, and family members are faced with having to protect and be protected from the affected family member. If the manic episode is repeated as part of the course of the illness, family members become retraumatized to the episode and may seek equilibrium through a variety of behaviors, ranging from acting out themselves (mostly in children) to calm responding to the situation and following a predetermined plan. Often family members try to reason with the affected member with little success. During episodes of depression, family members seek to motivate and instill hope within their family member and often face their own sense of hopelessness and despair when attempts to support, encourage, and offer solutions are rejected or treated with indifference. "One's attention is focused on the wellbeing of the person with Bipolar Disorder in such a way that one's own needs take second place. Being closely related to someone with Bipolar Disorder also means simultaneously foreseeing and following the often sudden and unexpected changes of the person with Bipolar Disorder." The DSM system is based on a medical model and is inherently limited in validating treatment approaches other than medical. <br>The <a data-href="Cultural Formulation Interview" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/cultural-formulation-interview.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cultural Formulation Interview</a> provides a framework to assist clinicians in assessing the cultural identity of the affected individual, perceptions of the distress (including how the cultural group of the client would view the problem), psychosocial stressors and 'cultural features of vulnerability and resilience,' and cultural aspects of both the client and the clinician that might impact treatment. Viewing culture therapeutically includes a perceptual expansion of cultural groups to include age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, occupation, military service, social networks, substance use, migration status, geographical region, relationship status (i.e., married or divorced), and not simply race and ethnicity. Though Bipolar Disorder presents with similar incidence in men and women across races and cultures, there is some observable difference in the course and progression of the disorder. This is due primarily to differences in initial diagnosis, access to treatment, and perceptions of stigma associated with mental health. <br>Comparing individuals with Bipolar Disorder from African ancestry with those with European ancestry, a trend was observed in the misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, most often as <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. It is possible that behaviors observed in minority patients during a manic phase are more commonly misconstrued as psychotic rather than manic. Another possibility for the misdiagnosis of schizophrenia in minority patients with Bipolar Disorder may be related to fears associated with seeking mental health services and an inherent mistrust of a system that has historically oppressed and marginalized them. Presenting as extremely guarded, paranoid, or having a blunt affect - all common symptoms of schizophrenia - may be rational expressions resulting from their previous experience of racism. Minority groups are disproportionately affected by challenges to healthcare access and experience greater stigmatization for seeking mental health services. Some minority groups may be disproportionately affected by environmental factors and social inequities, which may directly and indirectly contribute to both the development and progression of Bipolar Disorder. It is advocated that clinicians use empathy and authenticity when working with Bipolar Disorder clients, and to not be afraid of conflict within the process of making therapeutic contact. "The meeting and initial work with manic persons is often complicated. When we meet with them, we collide with them. We have to confirm the collision, not deny it." Demonstrating empathy for paranoid and grandiose thinking is not only critical for a successful therapeutic alliance, but gives the clinician a more accurate assessment as to the extent of the client's delusions, grandiosity, and paranoia. Counselors modeling for clients a sense of humor and often a playful attitude in their interactions together help clients learn to more realistically view themselves and reality-test relationships. Humor, appropriately and skillfully used, also helps reinforce for clients that their counselors do not view them as a culmination of their manic and depressive episodes, but as people who can be related to, which is empowering to them. Bipolar-affected clients often know that they negatively impact loved ones and others, and, as a result, feel deep shame and guilt for what is often irritating and offensive behavior, having a place that is safe for them to explore different ways of seeing themselves is important. The job of the clinician: First, to seek to existentially be with manic patients and then, to counterprojectively give perspective to those patients about their manic worldview, without completely denying it. This can lead to a healthy therapeutic alliance, which itself has a mood-stabilizing effect. Along with mood-stabilizing medications, this alliance can lead patients towards full recovery. The therapeutic relationship provides a place where the bipolar client can experience acceptance and the family can receive real and targeted support. It is important therapists show patience and adaptibility in working with patients with Bipolar Disorder and their families. Self-esteem, belief in one's own efficacy, and engendering hope for the present and future functioning is vital for those suffering from Bipolar Disorder. This awareness on the part of the therapist guides treatment and ameliorates the dysfunctional beliefs, the black-and-white thinking, and blunts the corrosive effects of mania and depression. Counselors should directly involve the family in the treatment of the identified family member with Bipolar Disorder. Family members can often provide much more accurate and rich perspectives regarding what happens when the family member with Bipolar Disorder is manic and/or severely depressed. Counselors can help clients with Bipolar Disorder to develop 'advanced directives' that may include signed consent from clients about how the illness is to be addressed or treated, including being treated against their will if they are in a full-blown manic or depressed episode. We want clients with Bipolar Disorder to be thinking about the course of their illness and making decisions about treatment when they are balanced, lucid, and making rational judgements rather than when they are manic or depressed. This can best be accomplished within the context of supportive family members who can express understanding and empathy, while at the same time express clearly the consequences of clients' manic and depressive behaviors and advocate strongly for responsive and responsible actions to be take. Genetic, biological, and environmental factors do not appear independent of each other but all 'interact in bringing about episodes of mood disorder or in protecting against their occurrence.' Understanding how these factors mutually impact and are impacted by each other over the course of the disorder can help manage episode occurrence and develop resilience in affected individuals and their families. Genetic and biological vulnerability includes the manifestation of the disorder in members of an affected person's family (i.e., who in the family has or has had the bipolar or related disorders), brain functioning (i.e., to what level may there be structural or brain abnormalities and quality of functioning and dysfunction in neurotransmitters), and other biological factors (e.g., chemical imbalances, changes in hormonal and immune system functioninig, sleep regulation). When vulnerability is high in these areas, the amount of environmental stress needed to trigger a manic or deppressive episode tends to be low. Those with high vulnerability have a low tolerance for and little protection form events that others without the disorder might manage quite well. Those with low vulnerability to genetic, neurologic, and biological factors would likely not be vulnerable to mood episodes unless there were high social stressors at play. Low environmental stress acts as a protective factor from the occurrence and reoccurrence of mood episodes. Because the nature of genetic or biological vulnerability may be hard to detect and determine, managing environmental stress becomes a high priority in treating and managing bipolar episodes and their severity. Psychosocial Provoking Agents: Largely impact vulnerability and the manifestation of manic and depressive states. Because Bipolar Disorder impacts individuals and families in often unpredictable and disorientating ways, and because of the consequences within the family, family members often assume patterns of responsing that range form being long-suffering, helpful, and supportive to being critical, blaming, and something uncooperative. These reactions contribute significantly to the emotional climate within the home and impact the perpetuation of continued episodes. 'Cause and Effect relationships between mood disorder symptoms and family environmental factors are bidirectional: Families are affected by Bipolar Disorder as much as they affect it.' The Vulnerability-Stress Model was developed from research on family interactions with patients with schizophrenia. Emotional Expression (EE) is a measure of emotional attitudes among relatives of a psychiatric patient. It is defined as critical, hostile, or emotional overinvolvement statements and attitudes family members communicate overtly or indirectly to the member (s) affected by the disorder. High EE Level within Family (Z 63.8) captures this dynamic. Individuals with Bipolar Disorder are two or three times more likely to deteriorate into a manic or deppressive episode in families where high EE exists and experience prolonged and more severe manic or depressive states.
High EE causes stress that contributes significantly to the perpetuation of mood episodes. EE develops and is perpetuated between the affected child and their parents. The child reinforces high EE reactions within parents, which impacts all relationship functioning. Children who exhibit behaviors and attitudes consistent with a low tolerance for stress, unstable mood, elevated anxiety, irritability, and problematic cognitive functionining largely meet the criteria for high biological and generic bulnerability. Generational influences within high EE families can significantly impact the vulnerabilities of family members who may be predisposed to Bipolar Disorder and bulnerable to criticism toward their condition. The Vulnerability-Stress Model helps clinicians assess and further understand not only the relationships between genetic, biological, and socioenvironmental factors, but helps focus attention on the EE and the quality of interpersonal reactions in the home that could be either provoking manic or depressive mood states or protecting affected individuals from their recurrence. Assessments for Bipolar Disorder are characterized as the individual assessment and diagnosis of the disorder while family assessment addresses essential aspects of the family environment including the quality of family interactions. A thorough biopsychosocial assessment should be conducted on the client upon the initial intake (or shortly thereafter) to capture a comprehensive context in which the presenting problems occur. All biopsychosocial assessments should include: Mental health history
Medical family history
Personal history that includes a developmental timeline
Conducting a mental status exam (i.e., appearance, behaviors/psychomotor activity, attitudes affect and mood, intelligence, and reliability, judgement, and insight)
Legal problems
Substance use
Spirituality/religion
Cultural/ethnic background
Suicidal ideation (including ideation, plan, attempts)
Financial concerns and socioeconomic status
Resources and Resiliency factors
Utilizing the Level I and Level II Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures associated with the DSM-5 can also provide a targeted assessment of symptoms, including the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale. Another helpful measure that can detect both threshold and subthreshold levels of mania is the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Bipolar Disorder Screening Scale. The goal of individual assessment is to obtain a differential diagnosis; it is important to: (a) administer formal assessments ethically and according to the protocols specified in specific instruments including being trained in the administration and interpretation of data
(b) gather and make sense of the data and share the results with clients in a manner that is comprehensible, clearly explaining the eliminations of assessment and assessment results. (c) use the data to confirm existing clinical impressions and/or to generate new clinical directions. Consultation with other professionals, including those of a treatment team is essential. The family can provide important context for the counselor in diagnosis and treatment, which leads to the process of family assessment. As part of the protocol of a comprehensive family assessment with all willing family members present, the counselor have the family (or a family member and the affected bipolar member) engage in conversation regarding their relationships or how they have attempted to solve problems they experience for 5 to 10 minutes and to observe and note the number of EE statements that are generated within the interaction and what the statements are. This gives important data about the level of EE, but sensitizes counselors to what family members value, what they may be struggling with, and the process and context of their conversations. <br>Developing sensitivity to the quality and types of interactions family members have can give counselors useful information in designing treatment, including the <a data-href="Genogram" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genogram</a>, which can be used to develop an understanding of where Bipolar Disorder (and other mental health problems) has occurred within the family. A genogram is a multigenerational family tree that symbolically represents different dynamics related to family and individual functioning that is psychologic, cultural, and interpersonal in nature. The Mood Disorder Burden Index was developed to assess caregiver perceptions and experiences in three core domains: patient mood symptoms, caregiver's worries about the future, and caregivers' interpersonal difficulties with the patient. The Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale: A self-administered instrument designed as an alternative to psychiatric measures that fail to assess for treatment outcome and recovery and well-being for those afflicted with Bipolar Disorder. It can give counselors insight into how the individual with Bipolar Disorder has been impacted by the disorder and, indirectly, how the family has been impacted. Counselors should always be mindful of being client centered, empathically inquisitive, and validating of the subjective experience of clients and their families as information is gathered during the assessment process. Assessment is a continuous process of measuring symptom reduction, improvement in family communication and problem-solving, acceptance, and self-efficacy living with Bipolar Disorder. Pharmacological intervention with an integration of individual psychotherapy is more effective than either protocol alone. Goals for treatment have focused on symptom reduction and prevention of future episodes. Psychosocial stressors can directly contribute to, or even catalyze, the occurrence of a bipolar episode. The occurrence of an episode can aggravate psychosocial stressors. Broader systemic influences including systemic racism, poverty, a global health crisis can all put a strain on an individual's ability to regulate emotion, something that is particularly difficult for individuals with Bipolar Disorder. A cycle can develop of constant challenge and crisis, which may self-perpetuate without the disruption of systemic treatment. Treatment of Bipolar Disorder should take an integrative approach to best serve the client's needs which invariably includes family systems work. Bipolar Disorder actually comprises a group of heterogeneous disorders, with significant variations in etiology, manifestation, and severity. The questions becomes not whether family systems treatment is or is not effective for Bipolar Disorder, but how and when it can be applied and adapted according to the needs of the client and family. FFT is an integrative approach to treatment of Bipolar Disorder, which combines psychoeducation and family therapy. It has been shown to enhance family cohesion and reduce family conflict. FFT begins with a thorough assessment of individual symptomology and family systems dynamics, and proceeds through a structured and preset treatment, with specific goals throughout the duration. Important elements of assessment: Gather as much information during intake as possible. Identify family conflicts that may be contributing to the stress across the system, which in turn can exacerbate Bipolar Disorder symptomology in the identified client. Determine the presence and severity of other environmental stressors - such as low socioeconomic status, experiences of oppression and marginalization, or experiences of extreme stress or trauma - which can impact family members individually as well as the relationships across the system. Understand the strengths and protective factors across the system that can support the emotional regulation of the individual with Bipolar Disorder, as well as the overall health of the family system. This information informs both the psychoeducation and therapy components of treatment, as it guides both specific goals and interventions. Understand the clients' cultural beliefs, practices, and influences on the family system. This is important to not only to provide a context to the experiences and dynamics of the system, but also to provide the counselor with a perspective on how FFT may need to be adapted somewhat to maximize efficacy. Determine appropriateness of the type of intervention. The extremes of bipolar episodes cause significant conflict in family systems, and may make some or all members unwilling to participate. Not all individuals are appropriate for the FFT protocol. Persons who are in acute phases of Bipolar Disorder, have developmental disabilities or other biological conditions that impact cognition, refuse to adhere to medication protocols or have a comorbid active substance use disorder are among those for whom FFT is not recommended. FFT is an effective treatment for Bipolar Disorder and its use can significantly impact relapse of the disorder. Higher rates of anxiety, depression, and general distress were found in caregivers of those diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Family-based interventions improve illness outcome and caregiver well-being. FFT has been found to have a positive impact on the mental health of caregivers, even when the diagnosed family member is not participating in the treatment. The course of treatment of FFT for Bipolar Disorder is fairly structured and is based on three treatment stages: (a) psychoeducation, (b) communication enhancement training (CET), and (c) problem solving. Treatment using FFT usually lasts approximately 9 months, and is structured around 21 sessions that generally generally begin following an acute phase of Bipolar Disorder. Clinical sessions are conducted weekly for the first 3 months, followed by a step-down to bi-weekly, then once per month. The philosophy of FFT is that Bipolar Disorder is experienced by the family, not just by the diagnosed client. As Bipolar Disorder episodes are viewed as 'disaster' experiences shared by the family system, which in turn cause disequilibrium. The treatment is reestablishing balance and harmony to the system, which in turn supports the health and wellness of the diagnosed client. Counseling goals are identified early in treatment and are informed from intake and assessment sessions. FFT for Bipolar Disorder begins with 6 general goals that outline and guide the overall process: Integrate the experiences associated with episodes of Bipolar Disorder. The focus of this goal is to understanding the diagnostic features of Bipolar Disorder as well as the experience of it from the perspective of the diagnosed individual. It also helps family members accept both the severity and significance of the diagnosis. Accept the notion of a vulnerability to future episodes. The focus of this goal is in the recognition that Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, persistent, lifelong diagnosis that requires continual support. The diagnosed individual - as well as the family - may believe that the condition can be 'cured' and thus have an unrealistic expectation of treatment. The periods of stability that occur between episodes can often contribute to this incorrect assumption. Accept a dependency on mood-stabilizing medication for symptom control. Consistent use of mood-stabilizing medication can minimize the intensity of Bipolar Disorder episodes and prevent future occurences. The undesirable side effects of many medications can make the client less willing to maintain this portion of the treatment protocol. Distinguish between the client's personality and the Bipolar Disorder. Over time, the diagnosed individual may be viewed by family members solely through the lens of the disorder. This can lead to inaccurate assumptions about the meaning and importance of behaviors. Recognize and learn to cope with stressful life events that trigger recurrences of Bipolar Disorder. FFT is based on the Vulnerability-Stress Model. This model includes both an understanding of preexisting biological conditions that create vulnerability and the environmental stimuli that trigger or catalyze reactions based on this vulnerability. While biological components cannot be altered, clients and families should understand how psychosocial stressors such as conflictual relationships, major life changes, and severe emotional stressors can impact the vulnerability of an individual with Bipolar Disorder. Reestablish functional relationships after the episode. The key features of this goal are support and connection. The before, during, and after phases of Bipolar Disorder episodes can be aggravated by the conflicts that arise across family systems in response to the situation. A goal for treatment is enhancing communication patterns within the family system and providing families with coping skills. In the initial stage of treatment using the FFT model, the primary goal is psychoeducation. This stage is broken down into phases with focus on different informational needs. In the beginning, the clinician imparts a great deal of vital information to the family system. It is important for this to be done in a warm, interactive manner. Clinicians using FFT must be aware of the potential for this stage to devolve into a solely instructional experience and take intentional, conscious steps to avoid this. Continually checking in with family members and encouraging discussion about the material can minimize this risk and enhance rapport with family members. In the beginning of the psychoeducation stage, the clinician should provide an overview of the FFT protocol, reasons for family participation, and the role of the clinician in the treatment process. Treatment goals should also be addressed, both the general FFT-based goals and the specific goals for the family system. This is also a good time to provide an overview of Bipolar symptomology, as well as prodromal symptoms and environmental triggers. The clinician should take the time to explore the unique experiences and perspectives of each family member. Often it is the associated meaning for the system members that impacts the manner in which they cope with and react to a Bipolar Disorder episode. Discussions around environmental triggers are an important way for families to better understand the blind spots they may have regarding the diagnosed family member's vulnerabilities. Events that may be considered minor, benign, or otherwise simply normal life events to some family members may prove to be substantially more stressful for the family member with Bipolar Disorder. A lack of empathy for the different experiences of the family member with Bipolar Disorder may also create conflict, as the affected family member may feel unsupported and misunderstood. <br>The DSM-5-TR <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of excessive or paralyzing fear and/or intense anxiety with associated disturbances in behavior. More adults were reporting anxiety-related symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic while more youths reported anxiety-related symptoms by the end of 2020. Various factors such as fear for the health and welfare of themselves and their families, inconsistent daily routines including school closures, and mounting tension in their homes have led to increased reports of anxiety in children. Despite experiencing anxiety-related symptoms to be diagnosed the individual must exhibit symptoms of significant distress or impairment across multiple domains in functioning (e.g., familial, social, academic, or occupational). <br><a data-href="Anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of intense fear or anxiety, avoidance of feared stimulus, and can cause life interferences, emotional distress, and impaired functioning. <br>The distinguishing features differentiating the DSM-5-TR <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> are the focus of each anxiety disorder or the core feared stimuli, and the focus of the fear informing the other individual domains of focus in the DSM. These domains include: Cognitive Response The cognitive response for the anxiety disorders is worry. Individuals with anxiety tend to exhibit two cognitive errors: Overestimating the probability of a negative event (i.e., thinking a negative event or outcome is much more likely to happen than objective reality)
Catastrophizing (i.e., thinking the worst-case scenario will happen) Physical Response The physical component is the physical response to fear such as muscle tension, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, and other symptoms associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Behavioral Response The behavioral response to anxiety is the active avoidance of the feared stimuli. In SAD (social phobia), the core feature is the fear of negative evaluation by others. It follows that across the other individual domains the core feature of fear, anxiety, or both would be consistent. An individual meeting criterion for SAD would fear being evaluated by others (core focus of their anxiety; cognitive component). The individual may sweat, tremble, or experience heart palpitations (physical component) as well as avoid giving speeches or talking in class (behavioral component). Anxiety disorders represent one of the highest prevalent disorders within children and adults. It is estimated that 15%-20% of children and adolescents are affected by an anxiety disorder. An estimated 40 million adults in the US have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. <br><a data-href="Lifetime Prevalence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/lifetime-prevalence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lifetime Prevalence</a> is the percentage of individuals who meet criteria for a disorder during their lifetime. <br><a data-href="Point Prevalence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/point-prevalence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Point Prevalence</a> is the percentage of individuals who meet criteria for a disorder during a specific period of time. Anxiety disorders severely impair physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, academic functioning, and the overall quality of life of an individual. Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are sick more days from work and have lower work productivity. Individuals with anxiety disorders are common patrons of primary care settings, specialty clinics, and emergency room services. Individuals with anxiety disorders have higher rates of relationship distress and divorce. <br>A <a data-href="Risk Factor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Risk Factor</a> is defined as any attribute, characteristic, or experience that increases the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder. A risk factor and the root cause of an anxiety disorder may differ greatly; therefore, having a risk factor is not the same as causing an anxiety disorder. Genetics or hereditability increases risk for all of the anxiety disorders. Individuals with first-degree relatives (e.g., parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder are at an increased risk to develop an anxiety disorder. 30% to 40% of variance in the anxiety disorders is due to genetics. Other risk factors contribute more than half of the variance to the development of anxiety disorders. <br>A strong link between the <a data-href="Temperament" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/temperament.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Temperament</a> style that is of <a data-href="Behavioral Inhibition (BI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-inhibition-(bi).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavioral Inhibition (BI)</a> and anxiety disorders.

Most temperaments are inherited, and family members are also likely to have similar temperaments. Parents are likely to model and reinforce their child's tendency toward BI or emotionality. Stressful life events and trauma relate to an increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder, such as early parental loss, childhood abuse, previous trauma, and peer victimization. Anxiety disorders are often maintained by several individual factors. An individual factor is identified as something that is internal or based on the individual as opposed to a family or societal factor that maintains anxiety disorders. The individual factors and systemic factors influence one another in a reciprocal manner. An individual's behavioral response and cognitions develop within the context of their family. <br>Several behavioral factors have been linked to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. <a data-href="Behavioral Avoidance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-avoidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavioral Avoidance</a> maintains all of the anxiety disorders. In the short term, behavioral avoidance is a coping strategy that temporarily relieves anxiety; however, long-term behavioral avoidance is a key factor in maintaining all anxiety disorders. Many times the larger system, either the family or school, reinforces behavioral avoidance of feared stimuli. Cognitive factors that maintain anxiety are the thoughts and thinking styles contributing to maintaining an anxiety disorder. <br><a data-href="Attentional Bias" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/attentional-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attentional Bias</a> for threat maintains anxiety disorders. Individuals with an anxiety disorder tend to pay more attention to stimuli that appear threatening to them, and they have difficulty noticing anything else other than the perceived threatening stimuli. Individuals with anxiety disorders perceive neutral stimuli as dangerous compared to individuals without an anxiety disorder. <br>A second cognitive factor related to the maintenance of anxiety disorders is <a data-href="Cognitive Avoidance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-avoidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive Avoidance</a>. Attentional bias and cognitive avoidance are internal processes; however, the family system or larger systems influence the internal process of attentional bias and cognitive avoidance. Many parents model attention bias for children. Parent may model cognitive avoidance, teaching their children to respond in the same manner. In adult romantic relationships, a partner may influence the process of cognitive avoidance as well. The majority of research on the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders focuses on the individual variables or individual therapy. Relational factors related to the etiology or maintenance of anxiety disorders: <br><a data-href="Relationship Quality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/relationship-quality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Relationship Quality</a> Lower relationship quality within the couple or family system relates to anxiety disorders.
Couple conflict, lower relationship satisfaction, and couple violence all correlate with adult anxiety disorders. Couple distress has been linked to an increased risk in developing an adult anxiety disorder. Conflict between parents consistently relates to childhood anxiety disorders. Individuals within a relationship who experience high attachment anxiety will often question their partner and behave in hypersensitive ways in an effort to avoid rejection which increases relationship distress. <br><a data-href="Communication" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/communication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication</a>

Sexual health is shaped by the interaction of a person's unique biological, psychologic, and cultural experiences and has significant impacts on mental, emotional, and relational well-being. Earlier editions of the DSM were also critiqued for omitting gendered differences in sexual functioning. Clinical judgement based on biopsychosocial context is recommended in diagnosis, particularly when the client possesses identities that are marginalized socially and within clinical research. <br>Sexual Dysfunctions (SD) in the DSM-5-TR include <a data-href="Delayed Ejaculation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Delayed Ejaculation</a>, <a data-href="Erectile Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Erectile Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Female Orgasmic Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/female-orgasmic-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Female Orgasmic Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD)</a>, <a data-href="Induc ed Sexual Dysfunction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Induc ed Sexual Dysfunction</a>, <a data-href="Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/male-hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Premature Ejaculation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premature Ejaculation</a>, <a data-href="Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction</a>, <a data-href="Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction</a>, <a data-href="Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction</a>. Clinical judgement is urged in ruling out the following causal factors: Inadequate sexual stimulation
Cultural factors that may impact the experience of pleasure
Problems better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, substance use, a medical condition, or by several relational distress, partner violence or other stressors. The DSM-5-TR uses the subtypes of lifelong, acquired, generalized, and situational to designate the onset of the sexual problem. A variety of factors that should be considered during diagnostic assessment include: Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems; partner's health status)
Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication; discrepancies in desire for sexual activity)
Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement)
Cultural or religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity or pleasure, and attitudes toward sexuality)
Medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code for the relationship problem or stressor may be listed. The usefulness of reframing the term dysfunction as a 'sexual concern,' 'issue,' or 'challenge' in the effort to depathologize sexual difficulties and adopt a more normalizing perspective when discussing sexual issues with clients. Modalities of family/relationship systems therapy (e.g., internal family systems, Imago therapy, and emotionally focused therapy) to support the treatment of sexual issues for individuals and relationships. Sexual issues are most often first encountered and then subsequently treated and resolved within the context of intimate partnerships. <br><a data-href="Sexuality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/sexuality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sexuality</a> encompasses sex, m gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, and reproduction and is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles, and relationships.
In the United States, societal sexual norms are often extensions of cisgender, heterosexual, White, patriarchal, Judeo-Christian, and able-bodied assumptions of sexuality. For this reason, many individuals - especially those with historically marginalized identities - develop an internalized sexual worldview that lies in contrast with their own sexual realities. This incongruence can lead to misinformation about one's sexuality, internalized shame, insecurity, and a myriad of other barriers that may negatively impact sexual functioning, sexual pleasure, and sexual communication and negotiation with partners. Culturally or religiously imposed values can shape a person's emotional experience related to sexuality in meaningful ways that can hinder and/or support one's sexual well-being.
<br><a data-href="Intersectionality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/intersectionality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intersectionality</a> - which posits that individuals hold multiple, intersecting social and cultural identities, each carrying certain privileges and oppressions given the individual's broader sociocultural and political landscape. Counselors seek to understand the ways in which a client's complex experience of power and oppression shapes their sexual functioning, as well as to explore the client's unique protective and risk factors given their multifaceted identities. Even in instances when sexual concerns are not the primary reason for seeking counseling, sexual assessment provides the clinician with an important opportunity to assess for possible comorbidity with presenting issues, better understand the client's cultural and relational values, and normalize the presence of sexual discussion amidst the counseling process. General sexual wellness assessment can be included in initial intake paperwork, as well as in follow-up sessions once therapeutic rapport has been established. Examples include: How would you currently describe your overall sexual wellness?
What concerns, if any, do you currently have about your sex life or current level of sexual satisfaction?
On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), how would you currently rate your sexual wellness? How did you arrive at that number? What changes would you like to see in that number? Are there any issues related to your sexual health and wellness that you would like to discuss in counseling? For couples, general sexual wellness assessment can include other items on couple intimacy and sexual wellness. Examples include: How would you currently rate your sexual intimacy today? How does that compare to other times in your relationship?
If you could have any changes to your current sexual relationship, what would you hope to see?
How do you define physical intimacy in your relationship? How important is physical intimacy to your overall relationship health?
How might your sexual relationships be related to your primary reasons for seeking couples counseling at this time? Counselors can help clients with initial discomfort by emphasizing: Sexuality is a normal and natural element of human existence
Sexual health often has important implications for clients' mental health and may assist the counselor in providing holistic and informed mental healthcare
Clients are free to answer only those questions that they feel comfortable answering, and they are also welcome to respond at a later time. Following an intersystemic framework, counselors can approach sexual assessment systematically and contextually. An intersectional systemic approach, 'balances attention to the individual, couple, and family system, as well as the larger systems in which we live.'
This framework outlines the five domains impacting client sexual wellness: Individual-biological/medical
Individual-psychologic
Dyadic relationship or couple dynamics
Intergenerational influences
Contextual factors such as society, culture, history, religion, and physical/geographic environment. The first level of assessment, individual-biological/medical, is aimed at understanding what if any, underlying biological and/or medical issues might be causing the sexual issue, including causes related to natural aging and developmental hormonal changes. People who have recently given birth may experience hormonal shifts that limit sexual desire, which may also be connected to culturally deprived beliefs about sexuality and motherhood related to reduced sexual drive. Examples include: Do you currently have any physical issues and/or medical conditions? How has this impacted your sexual wellness and functioning?
Are you currently taking any medications? What affect, if any, does this medication ahve on your sexual wellness and functioning?
Has disability impacted your sexual wellness? If so, how?
How has your sexual wellness and functioning changed as you have aged? Even if no medical/biological issue is reported, referral to a medical doctor or sexual health specialist (if the client has not done so already) is advised if sexual issues are present that appear to be biologically/physiologically based. The second level of assessment is individual-psychologic, which assesses potential psychological factors for sexual dysfunction, including comorbidity with existing and prior mental health issues. Psychotropic medications used to treat mental health issues can also interrupt sexual functioning. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., SSRIs) have been shown to further induce sexual side effects, such as lowered libido, and arousal/orgasm difficulties. Assessment questions of the psychologic dynamics of sexual dysfunction include: Have you previously experienced mental health issues? If so, what was the impact of those issues on your sexual wellness?
How does your mood typically impact your libido and sexual functioning?
When you feel (client's mental health symptoms), how does that tend to impact your sexual well-being? How, if at all, does your sexual desire and ability to experience pleasure shift when your symptoms are at their worst? Over the course of treatment, it is recommended to regularly monitor any changes in the client's sexual function as an additional point of insight into the client's overall mental health, as well as to establish a timeline of the sexual problem. The counselor will assess the relational dynamics of the sexual issue, which includes relational attachment, conflict history, communication, intimacy, and the presence of intimate partner violence (IPV). The goals of relational assessment are for the client(s) and counselor to explore how the dynamics of the relationship may be contributing to the sexual issue, as well as how each individual partner is coping with the presence of sexual difficulties. Common areas to explore include the client's sexual history with their current partner, communication strategies used by the client(s) when discussing sexual issues with their partners, and patterns of initiating, negotiating, and engaging in sexual activities. A sexual history assessment may also be a helpful tool in discovering the couple's shared and individual levels of sexual knowledge, communication patterns, and sexual desires/interests.
Example items for sexual history assessment include: How did you first become sexually intimate with your partner? How would you describe your initial sexual connection? How has this changed over time?
What types of sexual activities do you and your partner engage in?
What types of partners and solo activities give you the most pleasure?
How would you like to see your sexual relationships change or grow?
How is sex initiated in your relationship? How do each of you respond when you're interested in sex, but your partner isn't?
How do you communicate your sexual needs and desires to your partner?
What challenges do you face, if any, in talking to your partner about sex? The sexual worldview of individuals in a relationship may also have significant impacts on the quality of sex in the relationship, as well as the quality of the total relationship. Sexual problems can cause physical and emotional distress, shame, and embarrassment during sexual encounters, which can inhibit the level of satisfaction and pleasure derived by all partners. How do you feel when you're experiencing the sexual issue?
How does your partner respond to you when you're experiencing the sexual issue?
What are your major fears or insecurities about this issue?
How, if at all, are these fears related messages you received about gender/race/sexuality growing up? An imbalance of power (e.g., physical, emotional, financial, and/or childcare responsibilities) in the relationship can create challenges to the development of trust and intimacy, which can affect the sexual relationship and can further affect the individual's sexual functioning. Before addressing the sexual wellbeing of the relationship, existing violence and/or severe conflict would first need to be addressed. Example items to assess the presence of relational distress and violence include: How do you typically address, navigate, and resolve conflict in your relationship?
How does your relationship typically handle jealousy, anger, and resentment?
When, if ever, have you experienced physical or emotional violence in your relationship?
How does conflict tend to impact your sexual relationship with your partner? <br>The <a data-href="Genogram" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genogram</a>, which allows for the clinician to interview the client, sketch out family patterns of relating through generations, and assess the client's present difficulties from an intergenerational point of view. By creating a genogram with the client or couple, the counselor can locate patterns of <a data-href="Enmeshment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enmeshment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enmeshment</a>, <a data-href="Emotional Cutoff" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-cutoff.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Cutoff</a>, and <a data-href="Triangulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangulation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangulation</a> that may be connected to the sexual issues experienced by the client or couple. The genogram allows the couple to understand the sexual issue from a more contextual and systemic perspective, which can initiate new, more functional patterns of relating. In this way, the genogram is both an assessment tool and an intervention strategy (McGoldrick, 2008) Questions on the sexual genogram focus on six core areas: Messages received about sexuality/intimacy and gender
Communication and behaviors related to sexuality
Sexual secrets
Lacking information
Each partner's response to the other's genogram
Goals for growth in the client's/couple's genogram. Sample items to include on the sexual genogram include: How did you first learn about sexuality?
How do members of your family, community, and cultural background(s) tend to view sexuality?
How did your caregivers and family members respond to your sexual development (e.g., secondary sex characteristics, masturbation, first dating experiences, and access to safer sex/family planning resources)?
Are there sexual events that are silenced or not talked about in your family-of-origin?
Have you previously experienced difficulties with your arousal or orgasm?
How have these difficulties impacted you and your partner(s)?
How do you feel about the look, smell, and taste of your genitals? How does this impact your sexual connection with your partner(s)?
What is the meaning/purpose of sex for you? The goals of this final level of assessment are for the client to gain awareness of impact of cultural values on their sexual wellness, as well as to affirm the unique resiliencies the client has developed in response to these overarching systems. Example items to include in the contextual assessment: How, if at all, did religion impact your understanding of sexuality growing up? How about your cultural backgrounds?
Which of your identities are most salient to you? What assumptions/expectations exist for each of your identities with respect to sex (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc.)?
How do members of your cultural background tend to view sex and gender? Masturbation? Sexual pleasure?
In what ways, if at all, have you felt like your sexual well-being was limited because of your identities?
What sexuality supports do you wish you had received as a young person?
What changes have you made to your personal understanding of sexuality throughout your life? What is most empowering about your current sexual worldview? Often when clients simply articulate the unspoken limitations of sex-negative value systems on their lives, they are empowered to update these perspectives in ways that are more congruent with their current ethical framework. A primary aim of family systems counseling is for the client to glean new insights into the relational dynamics in their life and to subsequently feel empowered to shift the boundaries, attachments, and communication patterns of those relationships that are not actively serving the client's mental and sexual wellness. The PLISSIT model describes four levels of care ranging from introductory to specialized - Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, and Intensive Therapy - which can be applied to client. The first level of care, permission, describes the counselor's role in giving the client express permission to discuss sexual issues in counseling, while emphasizing that sexuality is a normal, natural, and worthwhile topic of examination throughout a person's life. Permission-giving is intended to affirm clients' sexual well-being, destigmatize sexual discussion, and invite continued and ongoing sexual exploration throughout treatment. Often limited information is needed in order to provide the client with additional knowledge related to their specific sexual issue (i.e., psychoeducation).
Specific Suggestions may be required to improve the issue, such as giving a client a homework assignment to view their genitals in the mirror, practice sensate focus with their partner, or engage in a series of nonsexual touch exercises with their partner in the counseling office. (Counselors are recommended to join sexuality-specific organizations for additional learning opportunities such as the Association for Counseling Sexology and Sexual Wellness (ACSSW) and the American Association for Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT))
The final level of care, intensive therapy, ins indicated in situations when the client is not finding relief from previous levels of treatment, which often signals comorbidity with underlying trauma, mental illness, and/or addiction issues. The need for intensive therapy may also prompt referral to a certified sex therapist, sexologist, or some other sexual healthcare. PLISSIT is not used in lieu of an evidence-based treatment approach, but rather as a supplemental directive informing the progression of treatment. Sexual assessment should be invitational, responsive to the client's cultural background and comfort level, and expressly relevant to the client's presenting issues. Questions based on the counselor's personal, nontherapeutic curiosity should be avoided.
<br><a data-href="University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference</a> can occur when a client brings up a topic that has personal resonance with the counselor and in situations where the client or client's situation reminds the counselor of someone/something in their own life. Countertransference is a normative experience for counselors; however, the counselor's initial awareness of countertransference must be followed up with consultation, supervision, personal therapy, and/or continued education in order to prevent personal reactions from further impacting the therapeutic process.
Arousal can be a naturally occurring response to sexual discussion; however, it is important for the client and counselor to adhere to clear boundaries if arousal/attraction occurs. "Sexual discussion can often stir up a wide range of confusing and exciting emotions. Maintaining a professional counselor-client relationship is critical in keeping this space safe and sacred for you. "
"I am getting the sense that this conversation is exciting you right now. While that can be a common response to sharing intimate sexual details, I want to remind you of our professional boundaries. If you need a break from this conversation, you are welcome to step outside, grab some water, or reschedule for a later time." The importance of normalizing the existence of client attraction and focusing on creating opportunities aimed at supporting counselors as they establish and uphold boundaries, process 'forbidden' feelings, and practice enhanced bracketing skills with a peer or supervisor. Counselors must clearly communicate goals, priorities, and rationale for the decision to apply a sexual dysfunction diagnosis, as well as facilitate an informed discussion of the risks associated with sharing a diagnosis with an outside source, such as a health insurance company or in the case of a judicial subpoena. Before the client consents to formal diagnosis for healthcare coverage reasons, the counselor and client must collaboratively weight out the benefits and limitations of this formal documentation. <br><a data-href="Gender Assignment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Assignment</a>: At birth, doctors make an initial assessment of gender as either female or male <br><a data-href="Gender Identity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/gender-identity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Identity</a>: A category of social identity and refers to an individual's identification as male, female, or occasionally, some category other than male and female <br><a data-href="Cisgender" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cisgender</a>: When assigned gender and gender identity match <br><a data-href="Gender Expansiveness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Expansiveness</a>: There are many ways people can express and identify their gender expansiveness, such as gender nonconforming, gender queer, nonbinary, or a variety of other terms that indicate a gender identity falls outside of the traditional options of only male and female. <br><a data-href="Gender Transition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gender Transition</a>: Where persons take social and often medical steps to be seen externally as their gender identity.

Cognitive Restructuring (i.e., identifying anxious thoughts and replacing them) Major Diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Less Common: Body Dysmorphic Disorder
Hoarding Disorder
Trichotillomania
Excoriation Characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions.
Obsessions: Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted. Compulsions: Repetitive behaviors that an individual is driven to perform in response to obsession or rigid rules that must be applied. OC-Related disorders differ from developmentally normative preoccupations and rituals. Symptoms persist beyond developmentally normative preoccupations and rituals. The symptoms are distressing and cause impairment in functioning. The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies. Common symptom dimensions include: Cleaning
Symmetry
Repeating
Ordering
Counting Fear of getting contaminated by people or the environment. Disturbing sexual thoughts or images. Fear of blurting out obscenities or insults. Extreme concern with order, symmetry, or precision
Recurrent intrusive thoughts of sounds, images, words, or numbers. Fear of losing or discarding something important Excessive or ritualized hand washing, showering, brushing teeth, or toileting. Repeated cleaning of household objects Ordering or arranging things in a particular way
Repeatedly checking locks, switches, or appliances
Constantly seeking approval or reassurance
Repeated counting to a certain number <br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> Exposure therapy is effective for reducing compulsive behaviors, even for people who did not respond well to medication. With ERP, people spend time in a situation that triggers their compulsions (such as touching dirty objects) and they are prevented from engaging in their typical compulsion (such as handwashing). Although this approach may cause feelings of anxiety at first, compulsions decrease for most people as they continue treatment. Medication

Adjustment PTSD
Adjustment Common feature is psychological distress following exposure to a traumatic pr stressful event that significantly affects the individual's capacity to function. Distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month following exposure to the traumatic event. Subcategories of symptoms for PTSD Trauma
Intrusion
Avoidance
Negative alterations in cognitions and mood
Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity The role of genes and environment Heritability Traumatic exposure Individual and family risk factors
Moderately heritable PTSD Twin studies suggest moderate heritability

Witnessing, in person, the event (s) as it occurred to others
Learning that the traumatic event (s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event (s) must have been violent or accidental. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event (s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). Exposure to war as a combatant or civilian

Severe motor accidents Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event (s), beginning after the traumatic event (s) occurred: Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event (s). (Note: In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event (s) are expressed. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream or related to the trauma event (s). (Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content)
Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event (s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) (Note: In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play)
Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event (s).
Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event (s). Persistant avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event (s), beginning after the traumatic event (s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following: Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event (s).
Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event (s). Negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event (s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event (s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following: Inability to remmeber an important aspect of the traumatic event (s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia, and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs).
Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world (e.g., 'I am bad', 'No one can be trusted,' 'The world is completely dangerous,' 'My whole nervous system is permanently ruined').

Reckless or self-destructive behavior. Hypervigilance
Exaggerated startle response
Problems with concentration
Sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep) With dissociative symptoms: The individual's symptoms meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in response to the stressor, the individual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following: Depersonalization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of one's mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly). Derealization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant, or distorted). Note: To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medication condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). <br><img alt="Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/trauma-and-stressor-related-disorder.png" target="_self"> Adjustment disorders

The disturbance begins within 3 months of a stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences
Stress, not necessarily a traumatic event Trauma takes root in and impacts an individual's limbic and endocrine systems
For individuals to develop a stress reaction, some sort of traumatic event must occur. Traumatic events originate in an individual's system or environment
Trauma originates outside the individual Trauma disuptes the affected individual's larger systems
Traumatized individual's reactions to stress are best understood in the context of their experiences as a member of a family system

The stress that results from trauma can negatively affect relationships
Caregivers who are struggling with trauma may have compromised caregiving
Compromised caregiving can exacerbate children's difficulties

Title: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5-TR, Editor: American Psychiatric Association,; Publisher: American Psychiatric Association Publishing,
Location: Washington, DC,
Year: 2022 ISBN: 978-0-89042-577-0
"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers. DSM-5-TR includes fully revised text and references, updated diagnostic criteria and ICD-10-CM codes since DSM-5 was published in 2013. It features a new disorder, prolonged grief disorder, as well as codes for suicidal behavior available to all clinicians of any discipline without the requirement of any other diagnosis. With contributions from over 200 subject matter experts, this updated volume boasts the most current text updates based on the scientific literature. Now in four-color and with the ability to authenticate each printed copy, DSM-5-TR provides a cohesive, updated presentation of criteria, diagnostic codes, and text. This latest volume offers a common language for clinicians involved in the diagnosis and study of mental disorders and facilitates an objective assessment of symptom presentations across a variety of clinical settings-inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. Important updates in DSM-5-TR include 1) fully revised text for each disorder with updated sections on associated features, prevalence, development and course, risk and prognostic factors, culture, diagnostic markers, suicide, differential diagnosis, and more; 2) addition of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) to Section II; 3) over 70 modified criteria sets with helpful clarifications since publication of DSM-5; 4) fully updated Introduction and Use of the Manual to guide usage and provide context for important terminology; 5) considerations of the impact of racism and discrimination on mental disorders integrated into the text; 6) new codes to flag and monitor suicidal behavior, available to all clinicians of any discipline and without the requirement of any other diagnosis; 7) fully updated ICD-10-CM codes implemented since 2013, including over 50 coding updates new to DSM-5-TR for substance intoxication and withdrawal and other disorders"--
Keywords: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; In Progress; Mental Disorders; classification; diagnosis The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continue to evolve.
Too rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... The degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder)
Clinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis.
The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress.
Reliable diagnoses are essential for: Guiding treatment
Identifying prevalence rates
Identifying clients for clinical research
Documenting public health information Physicians

Couple and Family Therapist It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Manic Episode A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness non-global-directed activity).
Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by related changes that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. (pg. 178)
What differs among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology. The presentation of children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol.
For children up to 12 years of age. Children with this symptom pattern typically develop unipolar depressive disorders or <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a>, rather than bipolar disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood. (pg. 178) Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. <br>The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>) <br>This diagnosis cannot coexist with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a>, or <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a>, though it can coexist with others, including <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Conduct Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/conduct-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Conduct Disorder</a>, and <a data-href="Substance Use Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/substance-use-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Substance Use Disorder</a> s. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. A diagnosis based on a single episode is possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of cases. <br>Careful consideration should be given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a> may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode of major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the depressive symptoms and functional impairment tend to be more severe and the prognosis is worse compared with bereavement that is not accompanied by major depressive disorder. Bereavement-related major depressive episodes tend to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diagnosis-(hdfs-8881)/readings/@americanpsychiatricassociationdiagnosticstatisticalmanual2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diagnosis (HDFS 8881)/Readings/@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2022.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 22:22:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[8. Accreditation and Legal Issues]]></title><description><![CDATA[ The idea of first year student being paired up with a second year therapist to help guide. Working with agencies? No surprises act: Giving clients an estimate about how much they are going to pay for services Struggle with terminating services. As long as file is open, you are legally their therapist. Case is closed because once the case is closed you are no longer their therapist. They can always come back. What will be different for you when we are ready to move on? What does it need to be life for this to end? We make a mistake of not planting that seed early on. When clients start thinking of me as a person, such as asking questions. When you are no longer in the therapist role, when you stop becoming a person's therapist and become a person to them. They begin to see you as yourself rather than a therapist. If you have not scheduled within 30 days, we would terminate and close their case. They can always call back. Purpose of accreditation: Ensure the quality of marriage and family therapy programs. Accredited programs meet or exceed all standards for accreditation. Standards for Accreditation: Version 12.5 Outcome Based Education (You have to show that your people are meeting target): Vs input based (You offer these courses, your people are confident). 360 Quality and Improvement Review Process
Start with Program goals, then student learning outcomes, and then targets for those outcomes. Review and gather data to show that you are meeting the targets or not and what you are doing to change the program to allow students to meet the SLO's If programs are accredited, licensure boards typically accept that they meet the educational requirements and client contact contact hour requirements for licensure (again, typically, always check with the state board) State of Ohio -&gt; 500 hour requirement
Board -&gt; 300 hour requirement Set standards for what adequate education and training is in the field. Protect students in those programs, knowing that they are able to be licensed in their state with that education, and protects the public in general, knowing that a therapist who graduated from an accredited program has the education and training needed to provide the service. Legal Age for Marriage in Ohio: 16 What are the Marriage Age Requirement Laws in Ohio? While females in Ohio may get married as young as 16 with the consent of both parents, only a juvenile court (in limiting cases) may consent to a marriage involving a male under 18. Same-sex marriage has been 'legal' and recognized in Ohio since 2015. Parentage: A man is presumed to be the natural father of a child in certain circumstances, including: The man and the child's mother are or have been married to each other, and the child is born during the marriage or is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated.
An acknowledgement of paternity has been filed pursuant to Sec. 3111.23
The term 'Punative Father' means a man, including one under age 18, who may be a child's father and to whom all of the following apply. He is not married to the child's mother at the time of the child's conception or birth. He has not adopted the child. He has not been determined, prior to the date a petition to adopt the child is filed, to have a parent and child relationship with the child by a court proceeding or an administrative agency proceeding. He has not acknowledged paternity of the child pursuant to Sec. 3111.21 to 3111.35. Understanding Divorce and Custody Issues: Dissolution vs. Divorce: Dissolution is when both parties can agree on all matters pertaining to separation (i.e., no fault divorce).
Divorce is when both parties can't come to an agreement. To get a no-fault divorce, you need to state in the Complaint for Divorce that 'that the parties are incompatible,' or 'the parties have been living separate and apart without cohabitation for 1 year.' The grounds of being incompatible can be defeated if your spouse denies incompatibility.
The fault-based grounds for divorce are bigamy, willful absence of the other party for 1 year, adultery, extreme cruelty, fraudulent contract, gross neglect of duty, habitual drunkness, imprisonment in a state or federal prison at the time of filing, and when the divorce decree of another state does not use any of these, since they had complexity to the process by requiring proof. If parties don't agree about custody agreements, the judge will decide based on child's best interest: The wishes of the parties,
The wishes of the child, if the judge interviewed the child in private, The child's adjustment to home, school, and community,
The mental and physical health of all persons involved, You may get subpoenaed, good idea to contact attorney and ask. If private practice, have attorney on retainer, The party more likely to honor and facilitate parenting time rights,
Whether either party failed to make all child support payments, including arrearages,
Whether either party or a household member was a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect, or a violent or sexually oriented offense involving a member of the family,
Whether either party has continuously and willfully, denied the other party's rights to parenting time in accordance with an an order of the court,
Whether either party has, or has plans to, establish a residence outside of Ohio. Other Considerations: The ability of the parties to cooperate and make decisions jointly,
Each party's ability to encourage contact between the child and the other party,
Any history of, or potential for, child abuse, domestic violence, or parental kidnapping,
The geographic proximity of the parties to each other, The recommendation of any guardian ad litem of the child Child support is determined by reference to the Ohio Child Support Guidelines and includes a chart to calculate the child's needs based upon the combined income of the parties. For example, if the combined income of you and your spouse is $96,000 Recommend learn the laws around divorce and custody in the state you are located in. Don't. (I am not unbiased) (There are training programs for this)
If you decide you want to do that work, then you are not also the therapist for the parties involved. Sometimes you may be asked to testify based on the work you have done with one of the parents, do your best not to. You can put that into your consent form, although might not be considered a legal document. Whenever there is a divorce with custody agreements about children, then you need to review those custody agreements and get the consent of parents who share custody with their children. If a parent has sole custody then their consent is enough. If there is shared custody, then both parents must provide consent to treatment, unless there is a stipulation in the custody agreement that says otherwise. You can work with child and parent of up to 6 session without consent. Can apply for social work and counselor jobs. 2022 Median Pay: $56, 570 60-65 with Masters, as you get your I, increases

As therapists, we know that reading is an integral part of our profession. A handful profoundly defined my identity as a therapist, but many of them felt dry, academic, and utterly disconnected from reality. If anything reading those books left me feeling even more insecure about my craft. Therapists have good intentions when they write books. But their message often becomes diluted - it becomes less about the nuances of personal development as a therapist and more about showcasing a series of their successes. Through my social media experience, I have gathered some basic assumptions about therapists: We often graduate from school feeling woefully unprepared.
We're scared we won't make any money. We (mostly) love the work we do.
We doubt ourselves constantly. We second-guess our career choice. We often feel unappreciated in the healthcare system. We're tired of subpar working conditions. We feel alone in our insecurities. We wonder if we're helping our clients. We have a dark sense of humor. We deserve to feel supported and empowered in this field. But we differ from our predecessors, and we need more books to reflect those differences. I see you. I am you. And I believe we need space for the messy and flawed and hopelessly insecure parts that can go along with doing this work. Myth: Successful therapists don't feel insecure. "Your insecurities show you care. Nobody needs you to have all the answers. People need to know you care." Your insecurities show you care.
Almost all therapists doubt themselves. And they should. When we're humble, we're more empathic and understanding, and we don't assume we know all the answers. Instead, we remain open to learning and growing. Myth: Therapists are healthy and well-adjusted professionals. Paradoxically, we are attracted to pain. Likewise, while doing this work, we bring our stories, pains, and fears into each session. And through treating the problems of others, some therapists strategically avoid examining their own. We might be experts in mental health, but our expertise doesn't fix our own problems. Myth: Successful therapists always know what to do with their clients. Successful therapists don't always know what to do. Our clients rock our worlds, and our uncertainties reflect that. We can't always fit the hurt. It is impossible to always know the next move or intervention or phrase. We all struggle with immense doubt. Successful therapists learn to embrace it. Myth: Therapists give advice. Therapists help explore the barriers that lie between knowing and doing.
Our job is to provide support and compassion. We support people in finding their conclusions about how they want to live their lives. We don't force them on to our preferred paths. Myth: Therapists don't make any real money. Myth: One credential is better than another credential. There probably is a best credential for you. Different credentials offer different levels of focus and expertise. Myth: Most clients are ready to change. Most clients want to change other people. They also want to change their circumstances. They want to wake up into their perfect lives, but not if achieving such perfection requires work. Clients do want to change. But many obstacles make that change incredibly challenging. Myth: Therapists make great partners, parents, and friends. Even when I try to model healthy communication or vulnerability, it doesn't mean others react positively. Therapists are humans. We get upset and flustered; we act irrationally, and we don't always think clearly. And because we give so much to our clients all day, we often have little to give to the rest of the world. Myth: Therapy must be face-to-face to be effective. American physicians performed lobotomies until 1967. Until 2010, American insurance companies could deny people healthcare coverage based on preexisting mental illness. We don't always know what we don't know. We only grow and get better with time. Therapy will evolve, and face-to-face therapy isn't the only answer. We must be open to new ways of helping. We may not agree with such changes, but we must promote diversity and flexibility in this profession. If we don't adapt, the career we love will die. Identify the Type of Insecure Therapist You Are: The Insecure Person: This therapist often: Struggles with an anxiety disorder.
Requires ongoing reassurance and validation for their skills.
Questions their abilities while in session constantly.
Fantasizes about switching careers.
Feels untethered in their sessions (they obsessively study new interventions or read new books or sign up for new training courses with the hopes of building more confidence). The Perfectionist: This therapist often: Believes they will fail at anything they try. Avoids taking risks or trying new things due to unwavering fear of failure. Wants to quantify abstract problems or solutions. Obsesses over policies, procedures and rules. Puts too much on their plate and typically overworks. Feels frustrated when clients don't succeed in predictable patterns. The Unresolved Life Shit Therapist: This therapist often: Struggles with remaining objective in sessions. Experiences intense and possibly uncontrollable countertransference. Stresses over their own mental health. Feels unable to maintain consistent and healthy boundaries with clients. The Straight-Up People Pleaser: This therapist often: Struggles or avoids confrontation with clients. Feels terrified and upset by aggressive clients. Dreads all forms of feedback. Feels paralyzed when faced with any semblance of conflict. Tiptoes around delicate issues in sessions or the workplace. Can You Be All of the Above?: You are just a human, and you have weaknesses. Now you're more aware of what they are and how they impact your work and your clients. So, how do you actually deal?
Get Your Own Therapy. Therapy has never been an exact science. The heart of what we do entails an abstract human element. We can have all the knowledge and skills, but we can't remove the human parts of our work. Behind every successful therapist is another therapist supporting them. Therapy makes us better therapists, and it also makes us better people. Therapy allows us to explore both our personal and professional lives in one space. It offers a valuable opportunity for growth, self-awareness, and healing. We cannot fully support our clients without thoughtful insight into our own lives. Furthermore, how can we expect people to be honest and vulnerable with us if we never sit on the couch ourselves? But What If I've Already Tried Therapy, and It Didn't Work? Even when they know it's important, many therapists love to resist personal therapy, Usually, we fear exposing our vulnerabilities. Sharing weakness with another professional might reinforce our sense of incompetence. "How do I find a therapist as a therapist?" If you want the easy answer, I don't have it. There is no easy answer. Our profession does not make us inherently unique as people, it just makes us privy to how psychotherapy works. Learn to Accept Distraction: Ironic Process Theory: When we try to suppress a though, another part of our brain checks in to ensure we're not thinking about it. Yet, this brain activity triggers us to think about it more. Intrusive thoughts happen all the time. Distraction is inevitable. It is how we deal with it that matters. Learn How to Move Back to the Present Moment: Accept the thoughts instead of resisting them. Pretend someone else is watching you. Make it a personal mission to move away from your boredom. Four pathways to reignite your interest: Acknowledge our distraction to the client. When we admit to our own shortcomings, we model being human to our clients. Pivot the conversation. Address our emotions. Pretend you are your client. You don't need to master working with one population right away (or ever). Keep an open mind during your training years. Get exposure. Learn new ways of doing things. Many therapists stumble into a population or theory without seeking it out. Stay curious about what you don't know. Learn to accept unconventional and nonlinear progress. Before we even attempt to measure progress, we must identify the obstacles that make measurements challenging. Here are some considerations: Obstacle 1: Clients lie (Both intentionally and unintentionally) “Our clients lie to us for many reasons. First, they want us to like them. Many clients fantasize about being our favorite client. They present well because they want us to feel proud and impressed by them. Often, they’ve had countless experiences related to feeling like they’ve let other people down. Their efforts to please emerge from the transference they experience toward us.”
“Sometimes, clients lie because they know our positions of authority and power, particularly when it comes to mandated reporting. They avoid disclosing sensitive material related to issues like suicidal thoughts or child abuse. They worry the truth will get them into trouble.”
“Clients also lie because they want to test us. Sometimes, they want to determine what we remember and what we forget. Are we really a safe person? Are we truly trustworthy? Can we actually hold the pain we promise we can hold? Most lies come from a place of hopeful truth.”
The very best lies often sound like the very best truths. Obstacle 2: Trust can take a very long time. We can't just turn on trust like it's a light switch. We have to foster it in every interaction we have with our clients. Obstacle 3: Progress in One Area Can Reveal Flaws Somewhere Else. Improvements in one concentrated area can have the effect of improvement in other areas. For new therapists, this reality may feel discouraging, and that's because it can be. After all, many clients come to us desperately wanting to change in their lives. Obstacle 4: The Client's Goal Isn't Always the Best Goal. Therapists working with acute, high-risk populations (substance use disorders, eating disorders, complex trauma, psychotic disorders) see this discrepancy all the time. They know about denial and minimization and intellectualization. As therapists, it's important that we recognize the hierarchy of treatment needs. Identifying and treating certain issues must precede others. However, a mismatch in priorities can certainly impact progress, and it can also create issues within the therapeutic relationship itself. After all, we aren't supposed to have an agenda. We are, however, supposed to keep our clients safe. At times, these issues can and will intersect. Obstacle 5: We Rarely Receive Productive Feedback. Nobody sees us in the therapy room. Our colleagues, supervisors, or spouses can't watch us perform. Although we discuss cases, we don't receive accurate feedback about our skills, because nobody truly knows what we're saying or doing. This lack of feedback makes measuring progress difficult. Most clients won't provide us with direct feedback. We are not allowed to solicit testimonials. This dynamic leaves us in a vulnerable position. We rely on clients to be honest about their feelings towards us. At the same time, we must straddle the reality of knowing that most clients avoid confrontation, want to please us, and blame themselves if and when things go wrong in therapy. Obstacle 6: Things Get Worse Before They Get Better. Therapists struggle when they watch their clients struggle. First, we care about their well-being. Additionally, we often assume that a happy client indicates that we are doing our job successfully. But we can't just measure progress by a client's level of happiness. In fact, happiness isn't always measurable or achievable. Sometimes, we must measure progress based on other factors like increased self-awareness or strengthening boundaries or changing negative behaviors. We must remember that our clients may remain in the 'getting worse' phase even after they leave treatment. This phenomenon is common when we don't control the termination. Remember that books don't always tell the truth. Because even when therapists try to educate their readers and showcase their weaknesses, they inevitably brag about their brilliance. All successful writing needs to be engaging, compelling, and crafted to appeal to a target demographic. Talented writers may know how to write about therapy more than they know how to conduct therapy. Just be mindful that even master therapists aren't perfect all the time. A good writer isn't always a good therapist. Understand that you'll never be the right age. We will never be the 'perfect age' to be therapists. No matter our ages, some clients will benefit from it, and others will have a problem with it. We invariably hold biases about age, but we hold biases about everything. Our clients make automatic assumptions based on every detail we provide them. And since we don't offer our clients much, they base their judgements on whatever is accessible. Regardless of the accuracy, the assumptions connect dots and illustrate a picture of who we are. Clients don't want us to be blank templates. They want to know we are human, and they will latch on to any shred of human evidence they can find from us. My best advice is to lean into this narrative. Your age is yours. While it doesn't define you, it is a fixed part of you. Don't forget that you are going to die. I recommend you imagine yoruself on your deathbed. Scan through all the past and current events, people, and places in your life. Don't spend too long in the space. Then visualize yourself drifting into death, settling into the depths of the darkest night. It's about reminding ourselves that life is incredibly short and precious. We don't need to have 'perfect therapist' etched on our headstones. We are going to die, and life is so much more than the sum of our careers. We are all going to die. But before we do that, we need to learn how to live. Know the limits of graduate school. Graduate school teaches the foundational principles of psychotherapy. We learn the laws and ethics, and we receive bite-size samples of theory, interventions, and psychoeducation. But until we do therapy, we really have no way of knowing what therapy feels like. School teaches us the logic of the work, but only experience teaches us the emotion of it. Understand your relationships can, will, and should evolve. In becoming therapists, we learn about the nitty-gritty patterns of human behavior. Simultaneously, by understanding these patterns, we engage in a deep and rigorous self-analysis. We have no choice but to also look inward, to examine how we operate in the world. And while this soul-searching offers tantalizing insight, all self-awareness has the potential to be painful. However, if you value emotional wellness and personal growth, the pain is a necessary part of the process. Cultivate a connection with a professor or supervisor. Professors and supervisors also hold power. They can dramatically affect your sucess in terms of internships, scholarships, or long-term career options. We all benefit from having someone who can vouch for us. Ideally, this person will: Write an excellent letter of recommendation if needed. Act as a reference when applying for internships or jobs. Provide appropriate and helpful guidance. If you are a new therapist, start thinking about this goal immediately. Make yourself memorable. Ask questions. Attend office hours. Be active and engaged in conversation, and show up ready to work and learn. Master time management. Audit how you spend every working hour for one week. Make red, yellow, and green to do lists. The reds are the most imminent and nonnegotiable tasks. They have to get done, so I prioritize them first. Yellows are important, but they are less time-sensitive and critical than the reds. I move to yellows only after I complete the red tasks. I reserve greens for last. Some days, I get to them. Most days, I don't. Ban distractions. We crave distraction. Although most of us complain about our procrastination habits, we forget that procrastination is also fun. The best way for me to ban distractions is by prohibiting them during my red tasks. I also build in ten-minute breaks every thirty minutes. This permits me to work in longer chunks without completely draining my energy. Remember that motivation is optional, but discipline is necessary. Motivation is fickle because it's a feeling. Feelings, as we know, are fleeting. Discipline, on the other hand, is an action. We can discipline ourselves regardless of our feelings. Many people who struggle with discipline also struggle with poor time management. That's because they wait to feel motivated to discipline themselves. Stop waiting. Start doing. Take care of your finances. Financial insecurity impacts our personal lives. But it also creates an insidious ripple effect in our professional endeavors.
Your financial health is part of your well-being, and today's stressors can become tomorrow's emergencies. If you're neglecting this part of your life, take the time to identify small changes you can make today. Focus on being a growth-oriented therapist. Training therapists should recognize they are learning, and that they don't need to know everything. They need to work hard, but they're allowed to have limitations. The goal is not having all the experience or knowledge. The goal is to have ongoing movement toward growth. This is a value that can and should continue throughout one's professional career. Growth-Oriented Therapists: Ask difficult questions to clients (even if they feel uncomfortable and provocative).
Presents mistakes, weaknesses, and concerns to their supervisor, with the intention to learn from them. They are active in supervision, and they offer practical suggestions and feedback to their colleagues. Focus on client growth instead of client approval. They address pain and confront clients when appropriate. Walk into the session with a sense of purpose and the mindset of practicing their skills. They feel a sense of control over the session. Use conceptualization skills to interpret the client's overall presentation. They consider what is being said, but they also consider what might be omitted. Understand the overall fluidity of therapy. They recognize that growth occurs mostly outside of sessions and that therapy is the catalyst for change (and not the change itself).
Have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. They feel motivated to work on weaknesses and readily accept feedback in doing so. Understand that therapy often has unknown outcomes. They conceptualize how clients might react, but they aren't tethered to this expectation. Stagnant Therapists: Maintain surface-level conversation and often play it safe in dialogue with clients.
Sugarcoat or downplay issues in sessions. They tend to focus only on what is going well. They share minimally in supervision, as they don't want to be judged by their supervisor or colleagues. Struggle to accept hardships within the therapeutic relationship. They often hold back in confronting clients. Walk into the session feeling scattered. They're at the mercy of whatever the client brings that day, and they often lose focus. Lack conceptualization skills. They take client content and disclosures at face value, and they become distracted or overwhelmed by content details presented in session. View sessions as separate entities. They judge sessions as 'good' or 'bad' based on variables like if a client made a significant breakthrough or responded well to a particular intervention. May have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. But, they feel paralyzed or doomed by their weaknesses and may become defensive over them.
Want controllable outcomes. They either avoid conceptualization altogether or they expect themselves to know what exactly what to do. Your training status isn't a secret. If you are a trainee, intern, or associate, you have already disclosed your status to clients. You are under supervision, and you work under someone else's license. Subsequently, nobody expects you to be an expert. But too many therapists fear making mistakes. I understand it is challenging to discern which risks are appropriate to take. Nobody wants to cause irreversible harm to their clients. But that's why we have supervision and training. That's why we work under someone else. This is your time to experiment and grow - you'll never have such ample opportunity again. Remember, your career is more than a calling. We must remember that we are healthcare professionals and trained experts in treating mental illness. We spend significant money and time to cultivate our craft. At times, we save lives. Our work matters. Let's rise to that. Accept all the anxieties. With time and experience, we gain confidence in ourselves and in our skills. Although the anxiety often feels paralyzing at first, you must trust that it eventually subsides. I found comfort knowing everyone else felt equally terrified. Accept that those negative thoughts will arise. Accept that they don't indicate your truth. As therapists, we help people move through their fears in almost every session. It only makes sense that we learn this skill ourselves. Practive letting go of controlling the room. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/sometimes-therapy-is-awkward-nicole-arzt.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Pre-Practicum (8189.11)/Readings/Sometimes Therapy Is Awkward - Nicole Arzt.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicole Arzt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 03:42:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@brownBowenFamilySystems2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Issue: 2

This paper overviews Bowen family systems theory and its approach to family therapy. It aims to introduce this influential approach and a sample of developments in theory and practice since Bowen's first publications of his research and theory. This paper is the second edition of a 1999 article with the same title (Brown, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy, 20, 94 and 1999) and, 25 years later, offers new insights from the original author's ongoing research into the theory. This new edition is in collaboration with a second author and Bowen theory scholar, bringing fresh perspectives on the theory's applicability to family therapy practice. The core concepts are presented briefly, and a case example with a parent and symptomatic adolescent demonstrates how theory informs the role of the therapist and the therapeutic work. Examples of criticisms of Bowen theory are also discussed, including the misinterpretation around the idea of emotion in Bowen theory that is communicated in Gottman's training. Differentiation of self is clarified as the integration of emotion and intellect rather than privileging one over another, which affords the opportunity for individuals to avoid being governed by the invisible strings of sensitivities in relationships and instead be themselves in good emotional contact with the other person.
Keywords: <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Differentiation" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Differentiation">#Differentiation</a> Families have resources for natural adaptation to life's challenges that are explored in therapy and are a foundational part of the family's understanding of itself and its capacity to make change. The eight concepts of theory shape clinical work that tracks emotional processes in relationships and creates the opportunity for recovery and growth. Important criticisms of the theory about culture and gender relevance, the dangers of neutralizing family violence and the use of emotion in therapy are discussed. Seeing the theory applied to a case with symptoms in a child reveals the centrality of observing emotional processes. <br><a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> 's <a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a>, or 'Bowen Theory,' was one of the first comprehensive theories that described how family systems functioned. The approach 'continues to have sustained influence in the practice of family therapy in North America with several training centers that have defied the trend of closing down family systems training centers following the fields' 1970s - 80s heydey.' Many influential family therapists have elements of Bowen theory at the heart of their conceptualization. The more Bowen theory is studied and applied in practice, the more understanding and appreciation of it is refined. <br><a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> was born in 1913 in Tennessee and died in 1990. He trained as a psychiatrist and originally practiced within the psychoanalytical model. At the Menninger Clinic in the late 1940 s, he had started to involve mothers in the investigation and treatment of schizophrenic patients. His devotion to his psychoanalytic training was set aside by the time he moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1954. He was committed to psychiatry becoming an accepted science and found fodder for this in natural systems and evolution. His groundbreaking research with NIMG enabled him and his research team to observe whole families in a residential treatment setting, where he began to include more family members in his research and psychotherapy with schizophrenic patients. This consolidated the shift from an individual and mother-child dyad focus to an appreciation of the dimensions of families as emotional systems. In 1959, he moved to Georgetown University and established the Georgetown Family Center (where he was director until his death). Here, his developing theory was extended to less severe emotional problems. Between 1959 and 1962, he undertook detailed research into families across several generations. Rather than developing a theory about pathology, Bowen focused on what he saw as the common patterns of all 'human emotional systems.' With such a focus on the qualitative similarities of all families, Bowen was known to say frequently, "There is a little schizophrenia in all of us." In 1966, Bowen published the first 'orderly presentation' of his developing ideas. In 1967, he surprised a national family therapy conference by discussing his family experience rather than presenting the anticipated formal paper. Bowen proceeded to encourage students to work on researching facts from their own multigenerational families of origin rather than undertaking individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy (a prominent training method of that time). The effort in one's own family is to better understand the individual self in the context of previous generational challenges, adaptations, and variations in family members' functioning. The interest in evolutionary process distinguishes Bowen from other family therapy pioneers. He placed his earlier study of Freudian theory with 'a study of the rich body of facts that can be proven and validated' in evolution and the natural sciences. Bowen writes: "I support the view that the human is as scientific as the other forms of life on the planet, that it will finally be possible to construct a total human theory from scientific facts alone." (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 360) Bowen was committed to his research and theory being embedded in science with the aim of developing a theory that accounted for the entire range of human behavior and its origins. Bowen focused on mechanisms/patterns that develop in families to adapt to challenges and defuse anxiety. Anxiety is presented as either acute, in that it is a response to an actual adverse event, or chronic, in that the stress response is sustained beyond factual threats.
A key generator of anxiety in families is the alertness to either too much closeness (togetherness force) or too great a distance (separateness force) in a relationship. "The theory postulates two opposing elemental life forces. One is built-in life growth force toward individuality and the differentiation of a separate 'self,' and the other an equally intense emotional closeness." While essential for human family survival, both forces are the source of tensions in relationships with family members, always shifting their pull for more connection or increased space and autonomy. <br>The degree of tension in any one family will be determined by the current levels of external stress and the sensitivities to particular themes transmitted down the generations and heightened or lowered levels of sensitivity related to levels of family emotional maturity or the degree of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>. If family members do not have the capacity to think through their responses to relationship dilemmas but instead continue to react anxiously to perceived emotional demands, a state of chronic anxiety or sustained reactivity may be set in place.

<br><a data-href="Societal Emotional Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Societal Emotional Process</a> Differentiation of self is the capacity to stay connected while also holding onto autonomous thinking and goal direction. It is twofold in that it has an intrapsychic expressing in integrating both thinking and feelings and an interpersonal component of maintaining a separate self while connected to a relationship. Viewed as a continuum from low to high Bowen articulates that, "A person with a high level of 'differentiation of self,' or 'identity,' or 'individuality,' is one who can be emotionally close to others without emotional fusions or loss of self, or loss of identity." (Bowen, 1978, p. 109)
In the same way that differentiation has both an intrapsychic and interpersonal component, fusion can be expressed either as a merging of feelings and thinking for an individual or a relational intense sensitivity to another's reactions, which leads to people giving up on their own ideas or values for the sake of the relationship going smoothly. Varying degrees of fusion are discernible in all families. A person in a fused relationship reacts immediately (as if with a reflex, knee-jerk response) to the perceived demands of another person without being able to think through the choices or talk over relationship matters directly with the other person. Energy is invested in taking things personally (ensuring the emotional comfort of another) or in distancing oneself (ensuring one's own). The greater a family's tendency to fuse, the less flexibility it will have in adapting to stress. Bowen developed the idea of a hypothetical 'differentiation of self scale' to assist in conveying the continuum aspect of this concept. He points out that this was not designed as an instrument to assign people to particular levels. Bowen maintains that the speculative nature of estimating a level of differentiation is compounded by factors usch as stress levels, individual differences in reactivity to different stressors and the degree of contact individuals have with their extended family. Bowen acknowledged that an effort to increase differentiation is a lifelong process. The goal is to observe the self on the spectrum to enhance awareness and improve functioning in small steps. One example of gradual steps is the effort to establish a more neutral personal relationship with each parent. "Achieving a person-to-person relationship with either parent is a major undertaking, but, if the differentiating person is aware that the result is highly desireable and of great potential benefit to self, [they have] a long-term assignment at which they can work constantly in their own way." (Bowen, 1978, p. 236) The scale of differentiation conveys that the theory is about a continuum of levels of functioning and not a theory that categorizes or pathologizes people. The goal is to observe self on this spectrum and increase functioning just a bit, leading to a similar lift in the functioning of the whole family. Bowen described triangles as the smallest stable relationship unit (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 135) because it is difficult to contain the emotional forces in a two-person relationship. Triangling is said to occur when the inevitable discomfort in a dyad is relieved by involving a third party who either takes sides or provides a detour for anxiety. Under calm conditions, it is difficult to identify triangles, but like all mechanisms to manage anxiety, they emerge more frequently and more intensely under stress. Triangles are linked closely with Bowen's concept of differentiation in that the greater the degree of fusion in a relationship, the more heightened the pull to preserve emotional stability by forming a triangle. The process of conflict, distance and over- and underfunctioning also feature as part of the Triangling patterns in relationships. This process is not dysfunction but can become problematic when a third party's involvement distracts the members of a dyad from resolving their relationship impasse. If a third party is drawn in, the focus shifts to criticizing or worrying about the new outsider, preventing the original complainants from resolving their tension. This detouring helps people steady themselves without working on growing their maturity. In positing the 'nuclear family emotional system,' Bowen 'describes the patterns of emotional functioning in a family in a single generation' (Bowen 1978, p. 376) Observable patterns in families for managing the anxieties inherent in a family's undifferentiation. These patterns are repeated over the generations: Certain basic patterns between the father, mother, and children are replicas of the past generations and will be repeated in the generations to follow. (Bowen, 1978, p. 376) Fusion that both preserves harmony and generates tension is present in varying degrees in all families, who will predictably utilize the following patterns to manage levels of discomfort. These tension management mechanisms are: Couple conflict and distance
Distance
Symptoms/illness in a spouse (over and underfunctioning reciprocity)
Projection of a problem onto one or more children The single-generation unit usually starts with a dyad - a couple who, according to Bowen, will be at approximately equal levels of differentiation (i.e., both have the same degree of need to be stabilized and validated through the relationship).
Permission to disagree is one of the most important contracts between individuals in an intimate relationship. In a fused relationship, partners interpret the emotional state of the other as their responsibility and the other; s stated disagreement as a personal affront to them. Conflict only becomes problematic when it is chronically sustained by emotional reactivity. (this is what we see in the clinic with couples who have been together for years and are coming in for couples therapy) A typical pattern in emotionally intense relationships is a cycle of closeness followed by conflict to create distance, which in turn is followed by the couple making up and resuming the intense closeness. This pattern is termed a 'conflictual cocoon,' (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 192) where anxiety is bound within the conflict cycle without spilling over to involve children. Distancing is not just inherent in patterns of marital conflict but a broader way of avoiding emotional tension that is part of triangling a child and over- and underfunctioning of spouses. It is one of the most instinctive ways humans reduce discomfort in a relationship by withdrawing emotionally or physically. Kerr describes, "An example of emotional distancing is people being in physical proximity but avoiding emotionally charged topics. The anxiety is bound in the avoiding of such topics." In a fused relationship, where each partner looks to the other's qualities to fit their own learned manner of relating to significant others, a pattern of reciprocity can be set in motion that pushes each spouse's functioning to opposite extremes. Both are equally undifferentiated in that they define themselves according to the reactions of the other. The spouse who makes the most adjustments in the self in order to preserve relationship harmony is said by Bowen to be prone to developing symptoms. "The one who functions for long periods in the adaptive [underfunctioning] position gradually loses the ability to function and make decisions for self. At that point, it requires no more than a moderate increase in stress to trigger the adaptive one into dysfunction." (Bowen, 1978, p. 378) ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/references/@brownbowenfamilysystems2024.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/References/@brownBowenFamilySystems2024.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:19:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[References]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/references/references.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/References/References.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 13:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family System Theory]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/family-system-theory/family-system-theory.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/Family System Theory/Family System Theory.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 13:45:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@bermanRiskAssessmentTreatment2006]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bibliography: Berman, A.

Publisher: Suicide Research Prevention CenterAbstract: The potential for a marriage and family therapist (MFT) to be confronted by a suicidal client or the potential for suicide in their caseload is significant, yet few MFTs have been adequately trained in the assessment and management of suicidal risk For that matter, so have few psychiatrists, psychologists, or other mental health professionals.
All too often, it is after the fact of a suicide of a client that the MFT is confronted with recognizing this gap in their training. Clinical Competencies: Working with Individuals At-Risk for Suicide: Attitudes and Approach: No treatment will be successful without the establishment of a good therapeutic alliance with the client. At-risk for suicide clients are often interpersonally dysfunctional and/or have significant pathology that makes difficult creating a strong working relationship. Patients who went on to commit suicide within two years of being hospitalized, compared to others still alive, were those most often described at their intake session as guarded, hostile, difficult to interview. Approaches and Attitudes in Creating Therapeutic Alliance: Being aware of how at-risk patients affect us, and effectively managing our reactions. It is up to the therapist to maintain a collaborative, non-adversarial stance in creating a safe harbor for these clients to share information essential for understanding their level of risk, and to develop a treatment plan that will reduce that risk. This work requires an active role for the therapist truly invested in understanding the client. It requires the therapist to be available, accessible, and willing to foster a dependency to strengthen the initial attachment. To effectively move ahead, the therapist and client need to develop a shared perspective and work as a team toward decreased risk. Understanding Suicide: The therapist needs to be able to accurately characterize suicidal and self-destructive behaviors to reasonably understand concepts of intent and lethality. Intent refers to the aims, purposes, or goals of the behavior - death (ending all further experience of pain by never more being conscious), a wish for rebirth, or to join a loved one in heaven, are commonly expressed statements that describe suicidal intent. Understanding the data of suicide and what characterizes chronic and acute risk ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/ethics-(7770)/readings/4.-breaking-confidentiality/@bermanriskassessmenttreatment2006.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Ethics (7770)/Readings/4.

In couple’s therapy, secrets between the couple often arise, and couple’s therapists must navigate a balance between their ethical and therapeutic responsibilities. This paper provides a scoping review of the literature on how couple’s therapists handle secrets in the context of couple’s therapy and discusses the ethical and clinical considerations in the context of the ethical standards of the AAMFT. Online databases were used to systematically identify peer-reviewed academic, English-language articles that focused on recommendations for therapists in handling secrets between couples in therapy. Seven articles met the search criteria. The empirical evidence supports a model of professional judgment, whereby the therapist can use their discretion about whether or not to disclose a secret on behalf of a client. To operate within the confines of ethical practice, we recommend therapists pair professional judgment with a clearly informed and signed written client policy.

Promotes healing and attachment, but final decision about disclosure should be left to offending spouse. Voluntary consent should be obtained at the outset of therapy to avoid jeopardizing trust and to remain an equal advocate for both partners. Possible exceptions to disclosure: Serious or terminal illness of injured spouse; imminent divorce; potential for violence; significant psychopathology in either partner; many years have passed, and issue is unrelated facilitated disclosure; it is ethical for therapists to collude in keeping secrets. Honesty is vital to recovery. After disclosure most couples choose the challenges of healing over divorce. Disclosure of infidelity is best course of action to resolve potential conflicts and improve working alliance toward couple healing and renewal. Through voluntary facilitated disclosure (based on the desires of aggrieved spouse) or referral, therapists should avoid double-bind of doing therapy in cases of non-disclosed secrets. The choice to disclose is subjective - one person may readily disclose what another might choose to conceal. <br>
<a data-href="Withholding Information" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/withholding-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Withholding Information</a>: Though there is some literature on withholding information by the client within the context of individual therapy, the literature on the disclosure of secrets to the therapist by one member of a couple is quite sparse. <br>
<a data-href="Secrets in CFT" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/secrets-in-cft.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Secrets in CFT</a>: Responsible handling of secrets between partners in couple's therapy is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems arising from the revelation, particularly due to the sensitive nature of secrets. Therapeutically, a secret has the potential to undermine the development of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the secret-disclosing partner if the secret is shared with the other member of the couple. Non-disclosure may also undermine the maintenance of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the other partner, who may perceive the therapist as triangulating with the secret holder, if the secret is not shared but arises later in the course of therapy. Additionally, there are potential ethical and legal problems that may emerge due to breaking the confidentiality of an individual through sharing a secret. <br>

But can result in harm if the therapist, wittingly or unwittingly, colludes with one member of the couple. The conjoint process provides an opening for a couple to grow and learn from one another that is often lost in traditional individual approaches. The therapist may not reveal any individual’s confidences to others in the client unit without the prior written permission of that individual. Many therapists work within this framework by having a policy around secrets explicitly stated in their consent form signed by clients at the beginning of therapy.

Future research should also assess the role of sociocultural identities within the couple as it relates to secrets. The quality of the therapeutic alliance may also have an impact on the decision to reveal a secret to the therapist and/or to the partner within the context of therapy.

Further research is needed to understand the role of therapeutic alliance and self of therapist issues in the context of secrets within couple’s therapy

Highlight
We recommend that therapists’ pair professional judgment with a written policy that both clients within a couple are clearly informed of and sign in order to operate within the confines of ethical practice.
-
Highlight
the empirical evidence to guide clinicians on their policies is scarce

Highlight
we recommend future research examines the impact of these policies on couples themselves, their willingness to dedicate time to therapy, and the impact of different policies regarding secrets on therapeutic outcomes.

This paper is intended to help therapists recognize family secrets, to clarify the theoretical and relational contexts in which they are embedded, and to suggest guidelines and approaches for their therapeutic management. A related aim is to raise and address some of the ethical issues that are inseparable from a consideration of family secrets. Secrets involve information that is either withheld or differentially shared between or among people.
Secrets tend, for the most part, not to be about feelings or thoughts, but about facts, real happenings or incidents. Importance of what Boszormenyi-Nagy and his coworkers have described as the ethical-existential dimension of human life in close relationships. This dimension concerns the facts of a person's life and their impact on him/her and those in relationship with him/her, as well as the actions of each person toward one another, especially as they affect mutual debts, entitlements, and trustworthiness. The network of persons involved in the secret as the awareness context. Refers to the network as a whole and includes those who are unaware of the secret as well as those who know it. A fairly simple typology of secrets can be drawn from the kinds of boundaries created in the relational system. From this perspective, three major types of family secrets emerge: (a) individual secrets; (b) internal family secrets; and (c) shared family secrets. Individual secrets involve those cases in which one person keeps a secret from the other person or persons in the family. In both cases, one person's secret is shared with no one else in the family. The boundary formed by the secret is located between the person holding the secret and the other(s). Internal family secrets involve those cases in which at least two people keep a secret from at least one other. Internal family secrets create sub-groupings within the family. Shared family secrets involve those cases in which all members of the family know the secret but are pledged to keep it from persons outside the family. Shared family secrets strengthen the boundaries separating the family as a whole from the outside world. The person or persons who know and keep the secret can be referred to as the secret-holder(s) and the person who does not know the secret as the unaware.
The subject, meaning the person that the secret is about. Subject and secret-holder may be one and the same person, or they may be different.
The confusion that surrounds secrets may make it difficult in some cases to make absolute distinctions between knowing and not knowing a secret.
For some secret-holders, there may be absolute clarity about the fact that there is a secret, but others may be quite surprised to recognize the secret as such.
There is a need for a way to identify secrets, even when the secret-holder is unaware of them as such.
The therapist should immediately consider the possible existence of secrets any time the word "know" needs to be used more than once in a sentence either by the patient or the therapist. It is nearly impossible to overemphasize the significance of loyalty dynamics in the creation, maintenance, and eventual facing of secrets in families. Often, the secret-holder feels, or may actually be, "sworn to silence." S/he owes it to the other person(s) to keep the secret. Disclosing the secret would be experienced as an act of betrayal and would arouse guilt over disloyalty. These cases concern dynamics of loyalty to the secret-holder(s). But the awareness context is further complicated by the fact that a secret-holder may also feel loyalty to the unaware.

Boszormenyi-Nagy has described as a "split-loyalty pattern"

Highlight
loyalty dynamics can contribute to the creation and maintenance of family secrets that, in turn, are likely to generate or exacerbate split-loyalty patterns.
-
Highlight
In some cases of secrets, there is an element of "one-upsmanship;"; the secret-holder feels "one-up" on the unaware.
-
Highlight
The power dynamics implied here exist in more subtle and often much more destructive forms in nominally more mature relationships; the secret-holder gloats in his/her secret knowledge and the other's ignorance.
-
Highlight
the secret-holder has the threat of "un-used ammunition."
-
Highlight
There is a dangerous and unstable tension inherent in these power dynamics of secrets because, in order to be able to savor the full effect of the secret, to squeeze every ounce of cruelty from it, the secret-holder must reveal it. Then s/he can see the reaction of the other person when s/he realizes s/he has been deceived. There is, therefore, an inherent instability in such patterns, always pressing toward destructive disclosures.
-
Highlight
Internal family secrets create or strengthen boundaries and alliances within the family between secret-holders. Estrangements develop between secret-holders and the unaware in response to the secret-holder's inability or unwillingness to discuss the secret and to the deception or mystification that often follows in the wake of secrets.
-
Highlight
A curious fact about secrets is that the boundaries created by them depend not only upon who knows the secret but knowing who knows.
-
Highlight
the boundary created between the two sons is just as real as that created between the secret-holder and the unaware, even though both know the secret.
-
Highlight
When all members know the secret and, unlike the case above, know they all know, the secret serves to strengthen the boundary between the family and the outside world. In extreme cases, it may make alliances between family members and persons outside the family virtually impossible if they feel they can neither reveal the secret nor become involved emotionally without revealing the secret.

Maintaining confidentiality in family and couple’s therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties; there are multiple avenues for problems to arise, and it is imperative for therapists to be able to decide when they should keep secrets and when they’re justified in breaching confidentiality. To add to this dilemma, therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients. As such, the purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Upon research, it became apparent that there is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Furthermore, there is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists’ decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients. Thus, this literature review presents the need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones’ culture can influence their beliefs.Purpose:
The purpose of this review is to determine the extent to which culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality
The purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.
The present study seeks to address this issue by considering the role of culture on the therapist’s decision to disclose as well as differences related to culture around clients’ feelings and expectations for privacy in therapy Introduction: Confidentiality in MFT can be complicated due to the various parties involved. (AAMFT) recommend that policies concerning confidentiality be discussed at the beginning of therapy during the informed consent process.
A therapist is not allowed to reveal any individual’s confidence in the system-oriented therapy setting without the prior written permission of that individual. Gottlieb (1996) described four conceptually distinct variations of confidentiality that could be used with couples or families: 1) treat information disclosed individually as confidential; 2) inform each client that no information is confidential; 3) allow certain information to remain confidential as a matter of personal privacy; or 4) agree to allow certain information to be temporarily kept confidential, with the stipulation that it must be disclosed at a later time.
May have very serious implications depending on the client (or family/couple) scenario.
in cases of couple and family treatment, the therapist should outline the rules of treatment, defining who the patients are, as well as confidentiality and any limitations.
There are no legal or professional ethics that directly address the issue of cultural mismatch.
Maintaining confidentiality in family and couple’s therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties.
Therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients.
There is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.
There is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists’ decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients.
Need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones’ culture can influence their beliefs.
One of the issues faced by therapists relates to whether or not secrets should be kept.
Relational therapists’ supported facilitated disclosure of infidelity, so long as it was in an informed and voluntary manner.
The therapists felt that healing and attachment security were optimally achieved through disclosure.
Findings revealed that therapists spent a great deal of time deciding how to handle secrets, used a “professional judgment” approach, and informed clients verbally of their confidentiality policy. Results also revealed that 25% of the sample noted that a couple was unhappy or expressed concern over the manner in which a secret was handled and that the approach used to deal with the secret was not predictive of the number of complaints lodged.
dilemma faced by marriage and family therapists when a child discloses information that a counselor is mandated to report
suggest relying on sound professional judgment when deciding whether or not it is appropriate to breech confidentiality and suggest reviewing confidentiality and the limitations associated with it on an ongoing basis.
Ethical issues surrounding disclosures by minor children in marriage and family therapy is grossly understudied.
Marriage and family therapists be aware of their state’s laws prior to breeching confidentiality.
In the event that a client is participating in illegal activity, the counselor should encourage the client to turn him or herself in to the proper authorities.
Should a counselor choose to report a client’s illegal activity, the authors argue that he or she should refer the client to another therapist because the counselor has now become the accuser.
Findings revealed differences in the ways of obtaining informed consent, approach to discussing confidentiality, information shared with parents or guardians, and the influence of client-specific factors on the management of confidentiality.
Two factors play a large role in the therapist’s decision to breech confidentiality: 1) the negative nature of the client’s behavior, and 2) the desire to maintain the therapeutic process.
A small percentage of respondents were not informing their clients about confidentiality (and its limits) until a problem arose.
The author recommends review and discussion of written confidentiality policies with each client, the need for comprehensive written policies about limits to confidentiality that go beyond legally determined requirements to include collaborative relationships, third- party payers, and supervision, and training on ethical dilemmas related to confidentiality focusing on the areas identified in the study as areas of need including collaborative relationships, legal knowledge, and managed care.
Grounded theory methodology revealed three main concepts: 1) defining who constitutes the therapy client, 2) maintaining privacy and confidentiality during the therapeutic process, and 3) handling private or secret disclosures made during individual breakout sessions.
While some information is disclosed, other information typically considered important to the counseling relationship is not disclosed at the outset of therapy (e.g., limits of confidentiality, treatment risks).
Many rehabilitation counselors do not fully inform their clients about the limits of confidentiality at the outset of counseling.
Participants’ view of privacy differed greatly from Western views and that the privacy protections used in the study created discomfort among participants.
Any definition of privacy must take into account the cultural variations in defining and understanding this concept.
Confidentiality is not a one-size fits all approach, particularly for practitioners working with a very diverse caseload.
More research is needed to directly assess cultural influences on the confidentiality.
Therapists can take steps to ensure that they become more culturally competent.
They note that many Native Americans consider silence to be a sign of respect, and that they value careful listening. Some may even perceive too many questions as being rude or disrespectful, along with taking notes during an interview since it defers from vigilant listening.
Asian American individuals may be less confrontational and yearn for harmonious relationships. They may also view direct eye contact as invasive, and may desire a level of formal respect.
As with Hispanic/Latin American individuals, religion may take prominence over therapy; the Catholic Church is very influential within this group, and often plays a vital role in helping individuals with mental health problems.
Some Hispanic/Latin American individuals may believe that their mental health is out of their control, which may create issues in situations where a therapist needs to aid the individual in establishing a locus of control.
Individuals within cultures are very diverse, and it is unfair to assume that these guidelines will apply to every single person.
It is still imperative for therapists to have knowledge of the possible cultural influences, as this can undeniably affect the client-therapist relationship including, but not limited to, the confidentiality process.
There is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality and even less that takes into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose during sessions.
The majority of studies focused on these issues without directly considering cultural influences.
Therapists should be weary of clients’ and their own cultural influences; careful care should be taken to ensure that the client understands the therapists’ confidentiality terms and conditions when confidentiality terms or a secret may not be maintained.
It is recommended that family therapists take into account the context of culture prior therapeutic decisions.
Culture plays a large role in an individual’s decision-making process in terms of when it is appropriate to breech confidentiality as well as how the breech is perceived.
Values may not always be considered ethical, which may create the possibility that a clinician’s personal values do not protect the welfare of his or her clients.
A lack of understanding around the limits of confidentiality would limit the amount of information disclosed in sessions.
Examined psychologists knowledge of legal and ethical guidelines and found almost 75% of participants were misinformed about their state laws, despite reporting a belief they were well aware of state statutes and ethical guidelines.
Therapists’ understanding of the confidentiality concept as well as the implications this may have for couples and families, has been grossly understudied.
The influence of culture on the therapy process is an important area of inquiry which has implications for the therapeutic alliance, the type of information disclosed, and treatment effectiveness and outcome. Therapists from different cultures viewed confidentiality policies differently, and 2) clients from different cultural backgrounds reported significant differences in their understanding and comfort level with their rights to confidentiality and its limits. May support the notion that there is passive discrimination occurring in that individuals from non-Western cultures have different perceptions and understanding of the confidentiality process, which may influence their willingness to disclose, and thus, impact the outcome of treatment.
Therapists should be more proactive in assessing clients’ understanding of the confidentiality process.
This lack of clear guidance has resulted in more and more providers deciding to not consult professionals in ethics or the law to resolve their ethical dilemmas; rather they are consulting supervisors and colleague.
Neither the AAMFT code of ethics or New York State Mental Hygiene Law offers guidance regarding how non-Western therapists should proceed if their cultural values or worldview is inconsistent with our Western confidentiality policy.
Reluctance among non-Western clinicians to breech confidentiality under any circumstance
“In practice, the decision to break confidentiality is multi-factored and complex, likely influenced by a combination of the psychologist’s own values, the items and factors discussed in the present study, and additional considerations that have yet to be discovered"
Confidentiality may not be a one-size-fits-all concept. Results indicate that clients from non-Western cultures did not completely understand the concept of privileged communication or the limits to confidentiality.
Confidentiality policies were limited and argued for their reexamination as they relate to therapy.
For some clients, the concept of confidentiality was inconsistent with their beliefs, thus creating a disconnect between one of the benchmarks of therapy (i.e., confidentiality) and an individual or family’s culture of origin.
Non-Western therapists expressed reluctance to breech confidentiality under an circumstance
Confidentiality guidelines should be tailored to the particular context and individuals involved in treatment.
Future research may wish to examine the decision- making process as it relates to confidentiality of non-Western therapists more closely with more diverse and larger samples.
It is not the intent of clinicians to conduct ineffective treatment or behave unethically; however, there does seem to be a failure to recognize the role of personal values and culture.
More specific information is needed directly from non-Western clients regarding how to modify the confidentiality process in a way that is respectful, yet still provides the safeguards intended
It is imperative that clinicians find a culturally-respective way to make clients feel safe to reveal what may be embarrassing or personally sensitive information in treatment
More precise comparative study is needed among cultures to better understand the influence of different beliefs.
Ethical therapist behavior clearly requires more than good intentions, and the values permeating therapeutic efforts must…be more than a matter of personal bias and subjectivity
Will inform a decision-making manual which can be easily disseminated to educators and treatment providers. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/ethics-(7770)/readings/3.-confidentiality-in-family-therapy/@mignoneconfidentialityfamilytherapy2017.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Ethics (7770)/Readings/3.

A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. While the 13 th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries. We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community. We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them. What is the presenting problem?

Gender was invisible, implicitly binary, sexist, racist, and White cis-men were the standard. White feminist lens (i.e., White binary, heterosexual perspective, Patriarchy, and sexism) Postmodern approach to gender (still binary and biologically determined) Fmaily therapy theory rests on normative concepts of the traditional family and idealized conceptions of family relationships. Inequalities in the family associated with gender have been regarded as of little importance to the development of macro theory in the field. The two most influential therapeutic models, psychodynamic and systemic approaches, are each marked by gender bias. Feminist therapy is an integrative approach to psychotherapy that focused on the challenges that women face as a result of bias, stereotyping, oppression, discrimination, and other factors, and how those stressors can negatively affect their mental health. 'Feminist Family Therapy is the application of feminist theory and values to family therapy.' Acknowledge and examine the roles of values in therapy for both the therapist and the client (s).
Intentionally introduce a discussion of gender into the therapy process using clinical language and techinques that acknowledge experiences across genders. Assess power inequalities in relationships rather than assuming equity in relationships. Include discussion of individual choice and responsibility in conceptualizations of family dynamics. Honor and appreciate the diversity inherent to families. Consider the clinical implications of interventions on both the family and on individual members of the family. Work actively to reduce power inequalities between therapist and client. (Leslie &amp; Southard 2009) According to intersectional feminists, there is not enough emphasis on the intersection of patriarchy with other factors, such as race, religion, and class. Intersectional feminists argue that other types of feminism assume that all women are exploited in the same way in the family. Self of the therapist

The aim is to deepen engagement and mutual understanding in hopes of working and healing together. Informed by evidenced-based theories and tools, the KCCM emphasizes the following: Understanding barriers to constructive conversations
Self-awareness and regulation
Values as anchors
Personal skills development
Healing in relationship connection The KCCM Goal
Barriers
Values
Openers
Take Action
Listen
Respond
Repeat Use both clinician skill and client perspective to understand the problem
Collaborate and jointly define the problem. Jointly formulate a hypothesis regarding the cause of the problem. Jointly develop ways to confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis on the problem, continuing to consider alternative hypotheses. Test out the hypothesis using both the client and the therapist as evaluators. If the conceptualization appears to be valid, develop a treatment plan. If the hypothesis is not borne out, jointly collect additional data and formulate new, testable hypotheses. Deliberate practice is individualized training activities specially designed by a coach or teacher to improve specific aspects of an individual's performance through repetition and successive refinement. Deliberate practice is an evidenced-based method of skill development.
Deliberate practice works best when training targets each student's personal skill thresholds or current ability. If a deliberate practice exercise is either too easy or too hard, the student is unlikely to benefit from it.
To maximize training productivity, performers follow a 'challenging but not overwhelming' training principle. This means that deliberate practice requires ongoing assessment of the student's current skill and tailoring the difficulty of exercises to consistently target a 'good enough' challenge. Skill Criteria for Attention to Diversity Convey a brief empathic response to a client/family member that indicates you hear their problem or the session content. Reflect on the problem/session content, looking for opportunities to deepen the conversation as it relates to their identity and unique experiences. Ask a question that conveys continued empathy and curiosity about their identity and unique experiences with the problem. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/1.-intro-to-diversity-in-cft/5.-multicultural-barriers-in-therapy-and-culturally-competent-assessment.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/1.

(Brown, 2003, p. 294) CRT helps focus our attention on the recursive interactions between institutionalized and interpersonal discrimination. Through the application of CRT to counseling and psychotherapy it is possible to interrogate the Eurocentric, ethnocentric and individualistic ways in which mental health practices are undertaken. Clients in need of psychological support can then be given a safe space for them to explore (in their own vernacular if necessary) their experiences of living in a capitalistic, racist, and misogynistic world. <br><a data-href="Remediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/remediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Remediation</a> The action of remedying something, in particular of reversing or stopping environmental damage. <br><a data-href="Prevention" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/prevention.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prevention</a> The action of stopping something from happening or arising. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/1.-intro-to-diversity-in-cft/4.-the-impact-of-systemic-oppression-in-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/1.

Any oppressive system has the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal. The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change. The -isms all work to establish a defined norm or standard of rightness under which everyone is judged. This defined norm is backed up with individual and institutional violence which makes the oppression possible. The defined norm is a notion that all of us might accept and promote for various reasons probably connected to a sense of inferiority or economic vulnerability. 'Whiteness as Poverty' argues that law has come to embody and legitimize benefits that accrue to citizens just because they are right. Despite the end to formal racial discrimination in the legal system race matters in how the law is carried out. Due to the embedded racism in American society, Whiteness can be considered a property interest. Right of Possession
Right to Use and Enjoyment
Right to Disposition
Right of Exclusion Critics of Harris' argument suggest that distributive justice sets up harm for the dominant group (in this case whites). Harris argues, "Acknowledging Black identity does not involve the systematic subordination of whites, nor does it even set up a danger of doing so." <br><a data-href="Equality" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/equality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Equality</a> Treating everyone the same (aims to promote fairness) <br><a data-href="Equity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/equity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Equity</a> Giving everyone what they need to be successful (may appear unfair) A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. This occurs when social structures that create and organize different social groups, e.g., gender and race, interact to produce effects that may not be intended. Example: Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment. This occurs when the political movements working towards justice for different groups, e.g., feminism and antiracism, interact to exclude or marginalize the interests of some subset of the groups, or reinforced another form of injustice. Examples: For women of color anti-racist and feminist political agendas often conflict with one another
This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism. A concept that refers to the cultural construction of an identity, including the production and the contemporary critiques of the identity. This occurs when images or tropes are taken to be representative of the group ignore or distort the complexity of the group. <br>"Representational intersectionality would include both the ways in which these images are produced through a confluence of prevalent narrative of race and gender, as well as the recognition of how contemporary critiques of racist and sexist representations marginalize women of color." (<a data-href="@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991</a>, p. 1283) The experience of being a member of more than one social group that cannot be decomposed into the experience of being a member of each. Example: The experience of being a Black woman is not just the experience of being Black and the experience of being a woman. The experience of being a Black woman is a proper compound of the two. Critical Race Theory (CRT) states that, 'Racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental categorization, attitude and discourse.' (Stefancic and Delgado, 2012, p. 21) and it challenges the 'ontological and epistemological biases subtly inculcated in the law, policies, or in empirical research that would otherwise hinter contextualization of harm and dysfunction resulting from racial stratification.' (Brown, 2003, p. 294) CRT helps focus our attention on the recursive interactions between institutionalized and interpersonal discrimination. Through the application of CRT to counseling and psychotherapy it is possible to interrogate the Eurocentric, ethnocentric and individualistic ways in which mental health practices are undertaken. Clients in need of psychological support can then be given a safe space for them to explore (in their own vernacular if necessary) their experiences of living in a capitalistic, racist, and misogynistic world. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/1.-intro-to-diversity-in-cft/3.-understanding-oppression,-identity,-and-intersectionality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/1.

Family dynamics
Historical factors
Social and political context Much of my identity is determined by who the world around me says that I am? (i.e. Who do my parents, peers, teachers, neighbors, the media, the culture say that I am?) 'The looking glass self' Charles Cooley Other people are the mirror by which I see myself
This is a multidimensional reflection of myself The social, cultural, and historical context is the ground in which individual identity is embedded - Erik Erickson Identity formation is a process 'located within the core of the individual and yet in the core of their communal culture' We must then integrate our past, present, and future into a cohesive unified self over the life course. In the US, there are several categories of 'otherness' commonly experienced by people in our society. These categories are based on the following characteristics: Race or ethnicity
Gender
Religion
Sexual orientation
Socioeconomic status
Age
Physical or mental ability In relation to otherness there is always a form of oppression connected to the various categories (i.e. racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, etc.) In every case there is a group considered dominant - systemically advantaged by society and a group considered subordinate or targeted (systemically disadvantaged) Inequitable social relationships are seen as the model for 'normal human relationships' I am from... (place, landscape, familiar, sights, smells growing up)
I am from (traditions, music you remember growing up)
I am from (ancestors, relatives, people in your life now, nonviolence heroes and sheroes) Multicultural counseling and therapy can be defined as both a helping role and a process that uses modalities and defines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients; recognizes client identities to include individual, group, and universal dimensions; advocates the use of universal and culture-specific stratefies and roles in the helping process; and balances the importance of individualism and collectivism in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of client and client systems.

Title: Re-visioning family therapy: addressing diversity in clinical practice, Editor: McGoldrick, Monica; Hardy, Kenneth V.; Publisher: Guilford Press,
Location: New York, NY,
Year: 2019 ISBN: 978-1-4625-3973-4
"A leading text for courses that go beyond the basics of family systems theory, intervention techniques, and diversity, this influential work has now been significantly revised with 65% new material. The volume explores how family relationships--and therapy itself--are profoundly shaped by race, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other intersecting dimensions of marginalization and privilege. Chapters from leading experts guide the practitioner to challenge assumptions about family health and pathology, understand the psychosocial impact of oppression, and tap into clients' cultural resources for healing. Practical clinical strategies are interwoven with theoretical insights, case examples, training ideas, and therapists' reflections on their own cultural and family legacies"-- Provided by publisher

Circular Questioning
A method of interviewing developed by the Milan Associates in which questions are asked that highlight differences among family members. (<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/books/@nicholsfamilytherapyconcepts2019.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019</a>) "A person cannot do right in one department of life while attempting to do wrong in another department." - Gandhi What is a system? A set of objects (elements) that interrelate to form a whole
Closed System: no interchange with its environment (doesn't apply to social systems)
Open System: One that receives matter and energy from its environment (applies to communication).
Consists of: Objects, or parts, elements, or members of the system These parts may be physical or abstract. System consists of attributes.
Internal relationships among its objects (mutual effects).
An environment. They are affected by their surroundings. Wholeness and Interdependence: In a system, the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
It is a product of the forces or interactions among its parts. It's parts cannot be understood separately.
The interdependence creates organization in the system (e.g., a family). <br><a data-href="Hierarchy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchy</a>: Systems tend to be embedded within one another.
Every complex system consists of subsystems. Given that systems are within systems, it is fuzzy as to where to locate the boundary between the system and the environment. Interchange with the Environment: Inputs and outputs.
The system affects and is affected by the environment. <br>Balance (<a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>) Self-maintenance
Sensing deviations from the norm and correcting those 'faults.' Self-Regulation and Control: Systems are often viewed as goal-oriented.
They are governed by their purposes. The parts operate according to guidelines and adapt to the environment on the basis of feedback. This aspect of system functioning is cybernetics. Change and Adaptability: The system must adapt to its environment. Equifinality: A particular final state may be achieved in different ways. Family as a System: <br>This model of a family as a system is extrapolated from the work of <a data-href="Ludwig von Bertalanffy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a> and his <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>.

Interaction with (vs. control of) mechanism
Observer's implication in the system Major Assumptions: Main difference is that the observer is a part of the system. Reality is self-referential (i.e., everything we know and see is based on our personal frame of reference). No reference to an outside environment. More to a System: Bounded: <br>A cell has a '<a data-href="Feedback Loop" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/feedback-loop.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Feedback Loop</a>,' enabling information to be transferred throughout the cell. All families have such a loop or <a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a> for communicating. Interdependent: All holons are interdependent on each other. Change one and you change the system. The same holds true of individuals in the family system. <br><a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>: All cells expend energy to maintain a steady state or homeostasis. This explains the difficulty of change within family systems. This thinking moves from linear causality to a more multi-dimensional approach to families. From A-&gt;B-&gt;C to interconnections between A, B, and C. Core Concepts: Problems: Understanding Problems: Your Clinical Theory
Learning Problems vs. Problems about Learning
Problems as Bad Solutions
Problems arising from childhood wounds, outmoded, limiting coping styles
Problems arising from Larger Societal Changes (and Issues) The Presenting Problem: A presenting problem is an initial symptom that causes a person to seek professional help. Describe the reason the client came to you. Include the client's definition of their problem. How long they've been experiencing the issue. Process: Understanding Process: <br><a data-href="Content" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/content.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Content</a>: Stories about what happened; shared at length and with extraneous details <br><a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>: Access the client's internal experience and working through parts of it. Process Questions in Therapy: <br>When a client is discussing something important to them tell the initial story and listen until your client invites you to help them. Otherwise, and after initial sessions you should mostly ask '<a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>' questions that: Focus on the client themselves and their internal experience
Help the client 'slow down' and reflect on ideas or feelings that seem significant
Use immediacy to ask about emotions you're noticing in a moment
Focus on themes, patterns, and affect Example of Process Questions in Therapy: "What is it like for you when..."
"I might be off here, but were you feeling... in that moment?"
When you notice heightened emotion, you can ask, "What's coming up for you right now?", "How are you feeling, talking to me about this?"
"What do you wish other people knew about what you are experiencing?"
"Today or in our previous sessions, have you found yourself thinking 'I wish they'd ask me about....?" "What question do you need someone to ask you, that no one has?"
"How did that make you feel about yourself, about your partner, about the relationship?"
"What you just mentioned about X seems important, at least to me. Could we slow down and stay with this idea/feeling for a moment?" Patterns: Observable repeated behavior, thoughts, or interaction that often manifest in human interaction and may manifest in therapy sessions. For example, a client may have a patter of shutting down emotionally or becoming distracted whenever you approach painful material. Writing a Systemic Hypothesis: Circular Questioning: Circular questioning is a technique used in systemic family therapy to 'invite participants in a conversation to consider relational aspects of the topic being investigated.' Ask open questions to explore communication and relationship patterns Types of Circular Questions: Bridging the Past: Circular questions bridge the past and the present together to find a moment in time when a shift in the family occurred. If this moment can be identified, it can give clues as to how to help the family. Has conflict always happened like this in your family?
What was it like before?
When did it start happening like this? Thirds: Circular questioning often asks a third person for their thoughts on how a dyad operates. This often breaks an unspoken rule in families that states, 'We don't comment about others.' This technique invites reflection on how two people's actions impact the behavior or mood of another. These questions are often used to assess how families respond to their members in different situations. "Dad, when Son is showing signs of depression, what do you see Mom do?"
"Mom, when Dad is taking care of Son, what do you think Dad gets out of?" Differences: When a behavior occurs or a significant change occurred different family members reacted in different ways. Circular questions help us understand the different ways people reacted and from that we can gauge how close people are, or how distant, enmeshment, and various other ideas. How is this different than before?
Who is most likely to comfort...?
Who is least likely?
Has this always been true?

Other mediating and moderating factors Common Factors Research in Couple and Family Therapy When two or more treatments compared to each other are designed based on a sound theory about how people change, and treatment sessions are structured to target those theoretical change processes (i.e., active treatments), there are typically very few differences in patient outcomes. Evidence-based research on common factors has shown that relationship factors in a therapeutic dyad or group setting predict the outcome of psychotherapy.

Preparation: The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change) Action: The person is in active modification of behavior. Maintenance: Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional. Relapse: The person falls back into old patterns of behavior. Upward Spiral: Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating Specific Factors: Elements clearly delineated by proponents of a given therapy as the active causes of change. Empirically Supported Relationships: Therapeutic interventions that possess empirical support for the efficacy of the therapeutic relationship, client values and beliefs, and the working alliance between client and therapist. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/lecture/4.-beginning-to-think-systemically-family-systems-theory.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Pre-Practicum (8189.11)/Lecture/4.

Structures typically have some form of hierarchical structure. Reciprocal and complementary functions. Parental involvement with children, over versus under involvement.

Patterns of interaction are largely based on roles and rules. Covert coalitions are often more significant than obvious groupings. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers.'
Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple
Parental
Child/Sibling <br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> Each subsystems is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries.

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.
The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.
The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. Theoretical Formulations: Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. But rather by a functioning structure Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. Problems arise when there are: Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions
Inflexible structures
Failure to adjust to changing circumstances Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment. The ultimate goal of therapy is structural changes to the family Alter the family structure so that the family can solve its own problems. General goal: create or strengthen executive subsystem Therapists have two types of assessment tools: <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> Spontaneous behavior sequences
Enactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems
Therapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences. Joining and accommodating (effective therapy requires challenge and confrontation) "The structural therapist needs to relate to family members in a way that validates their experience but does not preclude a challenge to the status quo." Working with interaction (Use of enactments)
Mapping structural patterns (Observing enmeshment and disengagement) Focus on the underlying family structure: Highlight and modify interactions
Intensity (interrupt rigid and difficult patters)
"Challenging to be effective must be predicated on the client's strengths. Contrary to a common misconception, it is not the 'opposite' of joining. Joining and challenging need to be seen as simultaneous qualities in any therapeutic intervention."

Modernism vs. Postmodernism: Postmodernism was a response in many ways to modernism and, hence, they can be considered to be two aspects of the same movement. But there are major differences between modernism and postmodernism. Two central tenets of the Enlightenment (beginning of the 'modern' period) were as follows: The perfectibility of human nature
The belief in human progress through the development of human knowledge, especially the sciences. In the 20
th century, scientific findings, like quantum physics, seriously undermined the possibility of a deterministic model of the world. As a guiding principle, reason was still affirmed as was the belief in human progress. The project of modernism was to examine the impediments still holding society back. Individuals ceased to believe that art and literary works bore one unique meaning; rather, postmodernists believed in deriving their own meanings from works of art and literature.
Modernism: It was an emancipatory project whose main idea was that traditional values and institutions were oppressive, divisive and inefficient and should, therefore, be replaced by rational values and institutions. Modernism led to progress in many spheres of life by changing the approach of mankind towards culture. Ultimately, modernism attempted to free humanity from its historical baggage through the use of philosophy and science. Postmodernism: Postmodernism was a reaction to modernism and was influenced by disenchantment brought on by the second world war. Postmodernism refers to the state that lacks a central hierarchy and one that is complex, ambiguous, and diverse. Postmodernists are the nihilists.
Postmodernists like Heidegger, Derrida, and Lyotard attacked the modernist belief in rationality, objectivity and universalism in favor of relativism (the view that there is no objective truth) as well as identity.
Grand narratives like freedom, societal progress, scientific progress were criticized by postmodernists, who instead emphasized that difference, rather than forced unity, should be celebrated. Postmodernism is a backlash against modernity. The collapse of tradition created a frightening situation whereby meaning became difficult to discern amid the horror of societal breakdown. Postmodernism, hence, represented a loss in faith in human reason. Postmodernism provides a bleak prognosis of the human condition and offers no real solutions. Conclusion:
- Modernism and postmodernism were both movements that emerged from an analysis of events within the modern period from the perspective of the values of the Enlightenment.
<a data-href="Postmodernism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/postmodernism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Postmodernism</a>: Theory that knowledge of things are not real unless we give them meaning.
The sense of self is a social construct. Our identity is created by interactions with other people and our reactions to society. Two threads: Weak (Social Constructionism): Proposes that social constructs are dependent on brute facts (most basic and fundamental facts and do not rely on other facts).
Institutional facts are created by social conventions and rely on other facts. Strong (Social): The whole of reality is dependent on social habits. All knowledge is a social construct and there are no brute facts. It would say we created the idea of something and how to explain it. Main criticism: Does not take into consideration the effect of natural phenomenon that goes on in society. Social constructionism only explains reality through the thoughts of humans, not by using fundamental brute facts. <br><a data-href="Michael White" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/michael-white.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Michael White</a>

Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave.
Experience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. Experiences can have multiple interpretations. The Narrative Metaphor: Focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. \Problems affect people. Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. Hence letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams. The truth of experience is not DISCOVERED, it is CREATED.
Narrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narratives of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new future. People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-stories aspects of their lives and relationships. Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. We 'story' and create meaning of life events using available dominant discourses - broad social stories, practices, assumptions, and expectations about how we should live.
'Problems':
Experienced when a person's personal life does not fit with these societal discourses and expectations. Process involves separating the person from the problem. Understanding Oppression: Dominant vs. Local Discourses Dominant discourses are culturally generated stories about how life should go. Local discourses occur in our heads, our closer relationships, and marginalized communities. Narrative therapists help clients become aware of how these different discourses are impacting their lives. Avoid judgements about what is 'normal.'
Avoid categorizing. Avoid the idea of general principles of what causes problems or what resolves them. The stories people tell themselves. Interpret their experience in unhelpful ways. Patterns of tunnel vision. Problem-saturated stories take hold and encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Separate the problem-saturated stories to open space for: New and more constructive views of themselves.
Look for unique outcomes 'Sparking events' Deconstruction: View the problem as an external entity to start challenging its influence. Unique Outcomes: Resistance to the problem's influence
Opens room for counter stories Involves finding new ways to view, interact with, and respond to problems by defining the role of the problems in their lives. Broadly involves the following phases: Meeting
Listening
Separating persons from problems
Enacting preferred narratives
Solidifying Process thickens and enriches a person's identity and life accounts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. At the end of each meeting, the therapists asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
Then, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
Meetings are typically 60 minutes
Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between) Collaborative
Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem
With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem
Takes notes of what works and what doesn't
Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation Meeting the person apart from the problem
Separating people from problems: The problem is the problem Optimism and hope
Co-author/co-editor
Investigate reporter Problem-saturated stories
Unique outcomes and sparkling events
Dominant cultural and gender discourses
Local and alternative discourses: Attending to client language and meaning Holds a position of curiosity.
Cherishes each person/family's unique stories. Invite clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. Narrative Therapy Principles: Therapist influential, but decentered.
Person separate from problem. All problems have exceptions. Opposite of problem is preferred. Preferred story woven into identity. Impact of relationships explored. Deconstruct societal norms. Personal decision making supported. Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. The problem is the problem. Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family. <br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>: There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (reexamining) established truths that oppress people's lives. People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems).
People are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. People are not their problems. People can develop alternative empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. Reject categorizing people. In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves WITH clients. They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis).
Want to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relationships. When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relation to it. Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict. Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story
Problems may be regarded as alien invaders Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)
Open space for new and more constructive views of themselves. Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy
Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions
<br><a data-href="Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience
Effects Questions: Elicit effects of the problem "How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationship?"
"Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful." Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multistoried lives.
Once people notice how their stories are problem saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time
At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
Then, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
Meetings are typically 60 minutes
Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between) CAUTION: Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories INSTEAD: narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories Counterstory Asking permission is central to the model
At the start of the first meeting, the therapist ask if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy.
Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from the previous session aloud and asking question, such as: Can you tell me about new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time Other times the therapist begins by wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations
Therapists use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session
Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem
Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keeping a story alive and growing Collaborative
Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem.
Takes note of what works and what doesn't
Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation Therapy is a relationship - a conversation Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories
Open space for describing alternatives
Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently
Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments
The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders
Therapists have more questions than answers It sounds as though problem is part of your life now.
How long have you been noticing this problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
How does the problem impact your relationships?
Does problem have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects the problem is having on your life?
Are you accepting what problem is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what problem is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.
The therapist invites family members to: Evaluate their current situation
Name the problems involved
Evaluate their relationship to those problems
Take a stand in regard to them
Tell more satisfying stories of their lives
Evaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. Private hopes and fears
Family interactions
Contributions of culture of origin
Traditions, legacies Questioning: Is that the problem speaking?
Whose values are guiding you in saying that? By exposing discouses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What talks have you have about the problem in your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
Is this conversation useful? How is it useful? Externalizing conversations
Relatice influence questions Who's in charge, the person or the problem? Identifying unique outcomes Reading between the lines of the problem story
Can you remember a time... Reauthoring What does it say about you... Illuminating or creating the counter-story
Reinforcing the new story Finding audiences, supportive witnesses, allies
Letter writing Deconstructing destructive cultural assumptions Listen to stories as stories.
Be attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story.
Ask about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationship.
Make sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem.'
Unless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences.
At some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories.
Try to put yourself in their shoes.
Do not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them
Listen and ask
Listen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust. Listen 'deconstructively' to family stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings.
Ask families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning.
We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'? Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society/
Develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work win the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult.
There are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play.
Deconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that suppose them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses. The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem.
Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people.
As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families. If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them. What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it.
As we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem.
What are the family's preferred directions?
'Standing against' the problem. Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes? Is the problem always with you? Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives.
Double listening. If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled.
If a person experiences injustive, they must have a conception of a just world.
When we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications. Stories need listeners as well as tellers.
Attentive witnesses.
The therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful.
What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking? It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions. Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who then amplify and accredit the stories that they witness. What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience.
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives. We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive. We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop. We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud. We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems. We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions. In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session. Our intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session. We might invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives. Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but didn't? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict...? Aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. Reality is socially constructed.
Reality is influenced by and communicated through language.
Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality.
There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. Telling One's Story: A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. Externalization Technique: Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. Deconstruction Technique: This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. Unique Outcomes Technique: To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that doesn't include your most pervasive problems. Some families prefer a different kind of therapy than narrative, some are seeking instruction and expert advice.
Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve
Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice
More qualitative research rather than quantitative studies
Little empirical support currently exists
Randomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist.

Title: The New Peoplemaking
Author: Satir, Virginia Keywords: <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:In-Progress" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#In-Progress">#In-Progress</a> <a href="https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Virginia-Satir" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Virginia-Satir">#Virginia-Satir</a> To understand the world, we can study the family: issues such as power, intimacy, autonomy, trust, and communication skills are vital parts underlying how we live in the world. To change the world is to change the family.
Family life is something like an iceberg: most people are aware of only about one-tenth of what is going on - the tenth that they can see and hear. Just as a sailor's fate depends on knowing that the bulk of the iceberg is under the water, so a family's fate depends on understanding the feelings and needs that lie beneath every family events. (What goes on under the table?) Over the years I have developed a picture of what human beings living humanly are like. They are people who understand, value, and develop their bodies, finding them beautiful and useful. They are real and honest to and about themselves and others; they are loving and kind to themselves and others. People living humanly are willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, and to change when the situation calls for it. They find ways to accommodate what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not. The family is the context in which a person with such dimensions developers. And the adults in charge are the peoplemakers. Four aspects of family life: The feelings and ideas one has about oneself, which I call self-worth. The ways people use to work out meaning with one another, which I call communication.
The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into what I call the family system.
The way people relate to other people and institutions outside the family, which I call the link to society. In all the troubled families I noticed that: Self-wroth was low
Communication was indirect, vague, and not really honest
Rules were indirect, nonnegotiable, and everlasting
The family's link to society was fearful, placating, and blaming In all nurturing families, I consistently see a different pattern: Self-worth is high
Communication is direct, clear, specific, and honest
Rules are flexible, human, appropriate, and subject to change
The link to society is open and hopeful, and is based on choice The changes all rest on new learnings, new awareness, and a new consciousness. Everyone can achieve these. Families everywhere deal with the same issues. In all families... Every person communicates; the question is, How, and what happens as a result? Every person follows rules; the question is, What kind, and how well do they work for them? Every person is linked to society; the question is, In what way, and what are the results? Natural Family The man and woman who sired and conceived the child continue to care for that child until the child is grown One-Parent Family One parent leaves the family by death, divorce, or desertion, and all of the parenting is done by the remaining parent Blended Family Children are parented by step-, adoptive, foster, or gay parents Institutional Family Groups of adults rear groups of children, as in institutions, communes, or extended families The same forces will be at work in all families: Self-Worth
Communication
Rules
Links to Society People are always doing the best they can. Developing a family is the hardest, most complicated job in the world. The very fact that you are reading this tells me that you care about yourself and the well-being of your family. Knowing something begins a change; experiencing makes it happen. If you feel shy or doubtful about inviting family members to participate in these exercises with you, become thoroughly familiar with what you are asking, feel it from your heart, and present your wish simply and directly. "Will you participate with me in an experiment that I think might be useful to use?" You maximize the opportunity for a positive response. Badgering, demanding, or nagging people to go along turns the transaction into a power struggle. <br>(I think this may be refer to the <a data-href="Battle for Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Structure</a> and the <a data-href="Battle for Initiative" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Initiative</a>) I see two kinds of pain: Pain of recognition of problems
Pain of blame
The first we can't avoid; the second we can. We can direct our effects to change what we can and to work out creative ways to live with what we can't change. <br><a data-href="Serenity Prayer" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/serenity-prayer.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Serenity Prayer</a> Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Does it feel good to you to live in your family right now?
Do you feel you are living with friends, people you like and trust, and who like and trust you?
Is it fun and exciting to be a member of your family?
Family that is more or less troubled does not mean you have a bad family. It only means that people aren't very happy and have not learned ways to love and value one another openly. Families can be placed somewhere along a scale from 'very nurturing' to 'very troubled' The atmosphere in a troubled family is easy to feel. I quickly sense discomfort. Sometimes it feels cold. Sometimes it feels as if everything were constantly spinning, like a top; I get dizzy and can't find my balance. Or it may be an atmosphere of foreboding, like the lull before a storm, when thunder may crash and lightning strike at any moment. Sometimes I feel very sad and cannot find an obvious reason. I realize that's because the sources are covered up. I begin to understand why so many members of troubled families were beset with physical ills. Their bodies were simply reacting humanly to a very inhuman atmosphere. Everybody has physical reactions to individuals around him or her. The first step of change is to recognize what is happening. There is little evidence of friendship among individual family members, little joy in one another. The family seems to stay together through duty, with people just trying to tolerate one another. More often humor is caustic, sarcastic, even cruel. The adults are so busy telling the child and each other what to do and what not to do that they never get to enjoy themselves as persons. In some families, people simply avoided one another. The family can be the place where one finds love and understanding and support, even when all else fails; where we can be refreshed and recharged to cope more effectively with the world outside. No one would intentionally pick this troubled way of living. Families accept it only because they know of no other way. A nurturing family is where I would be listened to and would be interested in listening to others; I would be considered and would wish to consider others. I could openly show my affection as well as my pain and disapproval. I would not be afraid to take risks because everyone in my family would realize that some mistakes are bound to come with my risk-taking - that my mistakes are a sign that I am growing. I would feel like a person in my own right - noticed, valued, loved, and clearly asked to notice, value, and love others. I would feel free to respond with humor and laughter when it fits. The houses in which these people live tend to have a lot of light and color. Clearly a place where people live, these homes are planned for their comfort and enjoyment, not as showplaces for the neighbors. When there is quiet, it is peaceful quiet, not the stillness of fear and caution. Each person seems to know that they will have the chance to be heard. If one's turn doesn't come now, it is only because there isn't time - not because one isn't loved. People seem comfortable about touching one another and showing their affection, regardless of age. People show their loving and caring by talking openly and listening with concern, being straight and real with one another, and simply being together. Members of a nurturing family feel free to tell each other how they feel. Anything can be talked about. Nurturing families can make plans. If something interferes with the plan, they can readily make adjustments, often with a sense of humor. This way they are able to handle more of life's problems without panicking. Thus the incident would be used as a learning opportunity (which raises the child's self-worth) rather than as a cause for punishment, which puts that self-worth into question. In the nurturing family it is easy to pick up the message that human life and human feelings are more important than anything else. These parents see themselves as empowering leaders, not as authoritative bosses. They see their job primarily as one of teaching their children how to be truly human in all situations. The behavior of these parents matches what they say. How different from the troubled parent who tells the children not to hurt each other, but slaps them whenever displeased. Parents are people; they learn that good leaders are careful of their timing: they watch for an opportunity to talk to their children when they can really be heard. When a child has misbehaved, the father or mother moves physically close to offer support. This helps the offending child overcome fear and guilt feelings and make the best of the teaching the parent is about to offer. We can help make new contacts with others and pave the way for better ways of dealing with each other. Parents in nurturing families know that their children are not intentionally bad. If someone behaves destructively, parents realize some misunderstanding has arisen or someone's self-esteem is dangerously low. They know people learn only when valuing themselves and feeling valued, so they don't respond to behavior in a way that will make people feel devalued. Even when it is possible to change behavior by shaming or punishing, the resulting scar is not easily or quickly healed. When a child must be corrected, nurturing parents rely on being clear: Asking for information, listening, touching, understanding, using careful timing, and being aware of the child's feelings and natural wishes to learn and to please. Children learn from the modeling of direct behavior. Parents in a nurturing family realize problems come along, simply because life offers them, and they will be alert to creative solutions as each new problem appears. Troubled families, on the other hand, put all their energies into the hopeless attempt to keep problems from happening; when they do happen - and, of course, they always do - these people have no resources left for solving the crisis. Nurturing parents realize change is inevitable. They accept change as part of being alive and try to use it creatively to make their families still more nurturing. The human heart is always seeking love. Troubled families make troubled people and thus contribute to the devaluing of self. Giving ourselves full permission to make the family a place to develop people who are more truly human will reflect itself in a safer and more humanly responsive world. We can make the family a real place for developing real people. Each of us is a discovery, and each of us makes a difference. Most of the things that caused families to be troubled are learned after birth. Since they are learned, they can be unlearned, and new things can be learned in their place. You need to recognize that your family sometimes is a troubled family. You need for forgive yourself for past mistakes and give yourself permission to change, knowing that things can be different. Make a decision to change things. Take some action to start the process of change. Whatever may have happened in the past represented the best you knew how to do at the time. Chances are that the causes of your family pain have been invisible to all of you. <br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is a concept, an attitude, a feeling, an image; and it is represented by behavior. When I was a little girl, I lived on a farm in Wisconsin. On our back porch was a huge black iron pot, which had lovely rounded sides and stood on three legs. My mother made her own soap, so for part of the year the pot was filled with soap. When threshing crews came through in the summer, we filled the pot with stew. At other times, my father used it to store manure for my mother's flower beds. We came to call it the "3-S pot." Anyone who wanted to use the pot faced two questions: What is the pot now full of, and how full is it? When people told me about themselves - whether they felt full, empty, dirty, or even 'cracked' - I thought of that old pot. Pot is a plain word in this use, almost a nonsense word. Families often find it easier to express themselves in pot terms and to understand when other people express themselves this way. When I say 'pot,' I mean self-worth or self-esteem. Every person has a feeling of worth, positive or negative. As with my old family pot, the questions are: Is my self-worth negative or positive at this point, and how much of it is there? <br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is the ability to value one's self and to treat oneself with dignity, love, and reality. Anyone who is loved is open to change. The crucial factor in what happens both inside people and between people is one's self-worth, one's pot. Integrity, honesty, responsibility, compassion, love, and competence - all flow easily from people whose self-esteem is high. We feel that we matter, that the world is a better place because we are here. We have faith in our own competence. We are able to ask others for help, yet we believe we can make our own decisions and are, in the end, our own best resources. Appreciating our own worth, we are ready to see and respect the worth of others. We radiate trust and hope. We don't have rules against anything we feel. We also know that we don't have to act on everything we feel. We can choose. Our intelligence directs our actions. We accept all of ourselves as human. Vital people feel high-pot most of the time. But vital people treat these temporary low-pot feelings as just what they are: a crisis of the moment. This crisis might well be the birth pains of some new possibility for us. We may feel uncomfortable at the time but do not have to hide. We know we can emerge from this crisis whole. When people feel they have little worth, they expect to be cheated, stepped on, and depreciated by others. This opens the way to becoming a victim. Expecting the worst, these people invite it and usually get it. To defend themselves, they hide behind a wall of distrust and sink into the terrible feeling of loneliness and isolation. Thus separated from other people, they become apathetic, indifferent toward themselves and those around them. It is hard for them to see, hear, or think clearly, and therefore they tend to step on and depreciate others. People who feel this way build huge psychological walls behind which they hide, and then defend themselves by denying they are doing this. Fear is a natural consequence of this distrust and isolation. Fear constricts and blinds us; it keeps us from risking new ways of solving our problems. Instead, we turn to still more self-defeating behavior. (Fear, incidentally, is always fear of some future thing) As soon as a person confronts or challenges whatever they are afraid of in the present, the fear vanishes. When persons with constant low-pot feelings experience defeat, they often label themselves as failures. After enough of these reactions, the self is vulnerable to drugs, alcohol, or others flights from coping. Feeling low is not the sameas low-pot. Low pot essentially means that when you experience undesireable feelings, you try to behave as though those feelings did not exist. It takes a lot of high self-worth to acknowledge your low feelings. Persons of high self-esteem can feel low. The difference is that people who are feeling low don't label themselves as worthless or pretend that their low feelings do not exist. Nor do they project their feeling on someone else. It makes a big difference whether one condemns one's self or sees this low time as a human condition with which one needs to cope. I shall be frequently calling your attention to this process of coping. Feeling low and not admitting it is a form of lying to yourself and others. Devaluing your feelings this way is a direct link to devaluing yourself, thus deepening the conditions of low pot. Much of what happens to us is the outcome of our attitude. Since it is attitude, we can change it. To build your self-worth: Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. An infant coming into the world must rely on experiences with people and their messages about their worth as a person. For the first five or six years, the child's self-esteem is formed almost exclusively by the family. After the child starts school, other influences come into play; the family remains important. Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication).
Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued?
Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere in which individual differences are appreciated, love is shown openly, mistakes are used for learning, communication is open, rules are flexible, responsibility (matching promise with delivery) is modeled and honest is practiced - the kind of atmosphere found in a nurturing family. Children in troubled families often feel worthless, growing up as they must amid 'crooked' communication, inflexible rules, criticism of their differentness, punishment for their mistakes, and no experience in learning responsibility. Such children are highly at risk of developing destructive behavior toward themselves and/or others. Much of an individual's potential is held in abeyance when this happens. Parents with high self-esteem are more likely to create nurturing families, and low self-worth parents to produce troubled families. The system evolves out of the architects of the family: the parents. I do hold parents responsible for accepting the consequences of their actions and learning to do differently. This is a good first step to improving the whole family situation. <br>It is possible to raise anyone's <a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a>, no matter what one's age or condition. Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. "There is always hope that your life can change, because you can always learn new things."
<br><a data-href="My Declaration of Self-Esteem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/my-declaration-of-self-esteem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">My Declaration of Self-Esteem</a> Our body language and activities reflect our thoughts and emotions. When we appreciate and love ourselves, our energy builds. When we use this energy positively and harmoniously to make a smoothly running system within each self, it creates a strong foundation from which that self can cope creatively, realistically, and compassionately with what life presents. "When I feel good about myself and life myself, the chances are excellent that I will be able to meet life from a position of dignity, honesty, strength, love, and reality." If a person's feeling toward themselves is one of depreciation, limitation, disgust, or any other negative attitude, the energy becomes diffused and fragmented. The self weakens, becoming a victim defeated by life: "If I do not like myself, I devalue and punish myself. I meet life from a position of fear and impotence, creating a state in which I feel victimized and act according. I punish myself and others blindly. I become interchangeably subservient and tyrannical. I hold others responsible for my actions." A person feels they do not count, feel a constant threat of rejection, and lacks the ability to look at themselves, others, and events in perspective. This is a state of low self-esteem.
A person who does not value themselves will expect someone else to be responsible for bestowing that value. This often leads to endless manipulations that usually backfire on both parties. To avoid being against others, people have been taught to love others instead of themselves. This results in self-depreciation. The question also arises, if one does not love self, how can one know how to love others? We have plenty of evidence that loving oneself makes it possible to love others; self-worth and selfishness are not the same. I have found that the first step toward diminishing fear is to acknowledge it openly. Then check your perception: "Is that true?" Fear of Rejection Good human relations and appropriate and loving behavior stem from persons who have strong feelings of self-worth. Simply stated, persons who love and value themselves are able to love and value others and treat reality appropriately. Having a strong sense of self-worth is the way to become more fully human, to having health and happiness, gaining and maintaining satisfying relationships, and being appropriate, effective, and responsible. When one cares for oneself, one will not do anything to injure, degrade, humiliate, or otherwise destroy oneself or another, and will not hold others responsible for one's actions. People who care for themselves would not violate their relationships to others through violence. Those who do not love themselves can easily become instruments of hate and destruction by unscrupulous people. They essentially give away their power, which often leads to emotional slavery. Perpetual placating exemplifies this. The stronger one's self-worth, the easier it is to have and maintain the courage to change one's behavior. The more one values oneself, the less one demands from others. The less one demands from others, the more one can feel trust. The more one trusts oneself and others, the more one can love. The more one loves others, the less one fears them. The more one builds with them, the more one can know them. The more one knows another, the greater is one's bond and bridge with them. Self-worth behavior will thus help end the isolation and alienation between persons, groups, and nations today. <br>(MA: is this referencing <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>?)

This book focuses on students, a pragmatic approach to treatment, regard for multidisciplinary perspectives, and respect for the influence of families on clients. Chapter 1 identifies concerns that new therapists frequently have, such as building confidence in their clinical work. Chapters 2-6 follow the usual time sequence of therapy--from initial contact with clients, to comprehensive assessment, to treatment planning and intervention. Chapters 7-10 deal with specific clinical situations based on presenting problems and the nature of client families. We examine major issues and approaches for working with children and adolescents, older adults, couples, and families that are struggling with serious mental illness. Chapter 11 highlights some common obstacles all therapists encounter, and provides concrete ideas on how to get unstuck when treatment is not progressing. Chapter 12 focuses on an often overlooked part of therapy--termination. In Chapter 13, we conclude the book by looking at emerging issues within family therapy" While family therapy offers a unique and important perspective in clinical work, much of what goes on in treatment shares common assumptions with all therapies.
assessing the appropriateness of a family therapy treatment for a specific problem is an essential clinical skill. It is important to be able to recognize when a problem is outside the scope of a family therapist’s practice (or skill level) and could best be treated by another mental health professional or in tandem with another healthcare professional.
A growing focus on treatment teams and multidisciplinary treatment approaches means that therapists must increasingly attend to the biological component of the biopsychosocial model and learn to collaborate with other healthcare professionals. Beginning therapists frequently experience feelings of inadequacy and insecurity about their clinical abilities Therapists and supervisors alike need to see confidence issues from a developmental perspective Paradoxically, the more one learns about how to do therapy, the more one realizes how much one doesn’t know.
Although the intensity of these feelings and the ways of coping will vary from therapist to therapist, every beginning therapist struggles to some degree with these feelings.
This disclosure helps the beginning therapist to accept that these struggles are developmentally appropriate rather than a sign of being unsuited for the profession
the therapist–client relationship is inherently therapeutic. A therapist doesn’t need to do something for clients to have a positive experience.
early experiences in seeing clients often involve a steep learning curve
It takes time, however, to gain enough experience so that many situations become familiar.
examine if distorted cognitions or unrealistic expectations are contributing to their fears or struggles with confidence. Beginning therapists can struggle with perfectionistic tendencies or critical self-talk
The only pathway to becoming an experienced therapist was to go through the learning process that he was going through
Experienced clinicians indicated that after 5–7 years (or about 5,000–7,000 hours) of clinical experience, they had encountered most clinical issues or problems several times.
The intense feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed that are common in the beginning generally subside after 1–3 months of seeing clients. Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, “self of the therapist” stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family. Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist’s ability to listen and attend to the client’s story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about “doing something” with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins. The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics. “I know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I’m stuck in the content.” Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
Therapists’ unresolved issues or “growth areas” can become impediments in therapy.
The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy. Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors. Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy. To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
You also need a strong social support network Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable Keep the “big picture” in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
Keep the following ‘reminders’ at hand:** Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities. The first contact is about to take place, and it can easily make or break a future collaboration where healing work can be done. One of the most critical points in the therapeutic experience: the period before therapy ever begins. During this fragile period prospective clients decide if they want to risk going to therapy. It is not uncommon for families to be at their wit's end when they finally decide to seek treatment or are referred and call for an appointment. Chances are they're worn out, fed up, and feeling hopeless. Individual family members may differ remarked For therapists and clients alike, beginning therapy can elicit feelings of fear, excitement, and nervous anticipation. Each client will take you on a different journey. In the first stage, the therapist welcomes the clients to therapy. The goal of this stage is to do introductions and put the clients at ease. Administrative issues are addressed in the second stage. The purpose of this stage is to ensure clients have a clear understanding of the therapy process, including confidentiality, videotaping, and fees. The goal-setting phase. Here the therapist learns what the clients hope to accomplish through therapy. The time devoted to goal setting will also depend on the number of clients being seen. Soliciting everyone’s perspective on goals within a family will generally take longer than working with an individual. Being able to establish goals for therapy is a realistic expectation. Assessment phase, which typically extends beyond the first interview. Therapist needs to accomplish several important tasks to make the initial interview successful. At each stage of the initial interview, you should be working on building your relationship with your clients. Important assessment information may also come out at any point in the first session, even before the therapist has begun a more formal assessment phase. The most crucial task of therapy is to successfully join with your clients.<br>
- <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> means that clients feel a sense of connectedness with you, which usually arises when they feel you understand, respect, and care about them. Joining is both a technique (developing rapport) and an attitude.
- It is the foundation for future work. Failure to successfully join with your clients will hamper all of your efforts, from assessment to treatment.<br>
- Failure to join with clients can lead to <a data-href="Premature Termination (PT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/premature-termination-(pt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premature Termination (PT)</a> of therapy.
- The therapist missed an opportunity to connect with the client and create a safe environment for therapy to take place.
- Joining is a process that should be carefully attended to throughout the entire initial interview.
- When you begin the session, you should attempt to put your clients at ease given that they are most likely anxious about coming to therapy.
- Ideally, you will be able to identify something you have in common with your clients that will help develop a sense of connection.
- Joining also takes place at other points throughout the initial interview.
- Highlight
Reflective listening, maintaining direct eye contact, or leaning forward can also reinforce for your clients that you are interested in them and concerned about what they are saying. Concluding the initial interview with a positive message for your clients can be another way to strengthen your connection.
-
Highlight
Although skills to facilitate joining can be learned
-
Highlight
developing a relationship with another person cannot be reduced to a recipe or set of techniques.
-
Highlight
who you are is the greatest asset you bring to therapy. Your personality, attitudes, life experiences, and compassion become a part of and help create the relationship.
-
Highlight
therapist characteristics can create a barrier to developing a connection. Therapists who have prejudices or negative preconceptions
-
Highlight
about people based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or religious orientation will likely have difficulty establishing a connection with clients who have these characteristics.
-
Highlight
you should be vigilant in assuring that personal issues or prejudices do not interfere with your developing a relationship with your clients.
-
Highlight
One of the early tasks in an initial interview is to address administrative issues so clients understand the therapy process.
-
Highlight
the therapist who is attuned to the process and not just the content when handling administrative issues may discover important opportunities for assessment or even intervention.
-
Highlight
need to be informed not only of the confidential nature of therapy, but also of the possible exceptions to confidentiality
-
Highlight
It is best practice to cover confidentially both orally and in writing with your client. The consent form for treatment
-
Highlight
should include what is and what is not kept confidential in therapy.
-
Highlight
Therapists working with couples and families must also consider how confidentiality among family members will be handled.
-
Highlight
The therapist must address the extent to which information obtained during these individual sessions will be kept confidential or shared with other family members.
-
Highlight
offer clear guidelines as to the bounds of confidentiality at the beginning of therapy.
-
Highlight
You may want to consult with other individuals or institutions connected with particular cases, such as previous therapists, psychiatrists, physicians, teachers, lawyers, courts, or parole officers.
-
Highlight
need to have clients sign a release of information form,
-
Highlight
to permit communication between you and the other parties.
-
Highlight
The signatures of all participants in therapy are required for the release of information.
-
Highlight
If others contact you about your clients, you should not even acknowledge that they are in therapy unless you have obtained the appropriate release of information.
-
Highlight
obtain a written release of information before discussing a case.
-
Highlight
Therapeutic issues may arise when discussing confidentiality with clients.
-
Highlight
You can tell your clients that you regularly consult with your supervisor, and that videotaping allows your supervisor to witness firsthand what happened in therapy.
-
Highlight
“two heads are better than one.”
-
Highlight
videotaping allows you to review what happened in previous sessions and perhaps have a new insight,
-
Highlight
recording a session gives the therapist the option to replay part of the session for clients.
-
Highlight
You should inform the client who will view the recordings, emphasizing that videotapes are considered confidential information.
-
Highlight
recordings are not kept permanently, but are regularly erased or recorded over.
-
Highlight
Clients should be asked to sign a form giving their consent for videotaping sessions. The form should
-
Highlight
outline the purpose of the videotaping, who will view the recordings, and what will happen to the recordings after therapy is completed.
-
Highlight
Some clients may be reluctant to be videotaped.
-
Highlight
You should carefully explore what is behind their reservations.
-
Highlight
You should pay careful attention to clients who are insistent about not being videotaped given they are the exception rather than the rule. These clients often have sensitive information that they wish to protect or keep secret.
-
Highlight
If therapy will include live supervision or the use of observing/ reflecting teams, discuss this with your clients.
-
Highlight
helpful to allow clients, at their request, to meet supervisors or team members who observe the sessions from behind the one-way mirror.
-
Highlight
It is difficult to assign a monetary value to therapy, and therapists often feel uneasy about charging fees while acting in a helping role. Therapist anxiety about fees can easily be transferred to clients and can create conflict and stress in therapy. Comfort in handling fees will increase with therapeutic experience and confidence in your ability to provide a worthwhile service.
-
Highlight
There is a business aspect of the therapy relationship and discussing fees should be handled in a business-like manner.
-
Highlight
the client is purchasing a service.
-
Highlight
Most programs or clinicians establish a minimum fee and then work within a range.
-
Highlight
ou should discuss acceptable forms of payment, when the fee should be paid, and the fee for late cancellation or “no-show” appointments, if applicable.
-
Highlight
useful to have a written agreement that discusses the fees and policies regarding fees.
-
Highlight
third-party payers limit the number of sessions, or the types of presenting problems or diagnoses they will reimburse.
-
Highlight
If a third-party payer is involved, the therapist should verify insurance coverage at the outset of therapy. Issues that need to be addressed may include provider eligibility, annual deductibles, rate of reimbursement, limitations on the number of sessions, or types of treatments covered. Usually a DSM-5 diagnosis will need to be assigned to the insured patient.
-
Highlight
As with other administrative issues, working out the details for payment can be part of the diagnostic process and help to clarify the family’s expectations of and responsibilities for therapy.
-
Highlight
Generally, free services tend not to be valued by clients. A fee, even a small one, provides some incentive to make effective use of services. Paying a fee also indicates that the therapy has value to the client.
-
Highlight
therapists may be required to discuss with clients their professional qualifications.
-
Highlight
Many agencies and practitioners have clients read and sign an informed consent statement that generally includes a brief description of what therapy is, including the potential risks, such as being asked to examine painful issues.
-
Highlight
define clients’ expectations for what therapy will accomplish and how it will be conducted. This is essential to ensure that clients’ needs are compatible with what you, as the therapist, can or are willing to offer.
-
Highlight
The first step in defining expectations is to ask your clients what they would like to accomplish through therapy.
-
Highlight
How can I be helpful to you?” or “What are you hiring me to do?
-
Highlight
Clients hope that you will be able to fix these problems. Individuals will often say what they want to eliminate
-
Highlight
and have a harder time articulating what they want
-
Highlight
If possible, encourage your clients to describe desired changes in positive language (what will be happening) rather than in negative language (what won’t be happening)
-
Highlight
It is important that each family member is given the opportunity to be heard when discussing problems and goals. This will help in joining with each individual.
-
Highlight
you may discover there is disagreement about the problem itself or who has the problem.
-
Highlight
You don’t want to anger the person who talks excessively, but if you fail to interrupt this behavior, other family members may lose faith in your ability to lead the session.
-
Highlight
In defining goals, a number of challenges can arise. Your clients may identify multiple problem areas, with little distinction of priorities.
-
Highlight
you will need to obtain your clients’ perspective on the relative importance of their problems.
-
Highlight
“Of the issues you have presented, which is most important, and which is least important?”
-
Highlight
your clients may not have a clear idea of what the problem is or what their goals for therapy are.
-
Highlight
may need to contract for a limited number of sessions to explore and define problem areas and goals.
-
Highlight
Another potential problem is that clients may have unrealistically high expectations or goals.
-
Highlight
Setting goals may be further complicated by the unstated agenda of a client, one that he or she feels is not appropriate to disclose.
-
Highlight
Sometimes, even the clients may not be totally aware of their reasons for seeking therapy.
-
Highlight
Alternatively, individuals in couples or families may define goals that initially appear incompatible.
-
Highlight
In these situations, you may need to creatively reframe the goals in such a way as to make them compatible or link them together.
-
Highlight
Once you have a clear understanding of what your clients want or expect from therapy, you need to decide whether it is appropriate for you to take on the case.
-
Highlight
you must assess whether the case is within your scope of practice, that is, whether the clients are expecting help for issues that would be considered appropriate for a family therapist to treat.
-
Highlight
The scope of practice is defined for therapists by the laws that license or certify therapists in their state.
-
Highlight
If the case falls outside your scope of practice, you will need to refer your clients to an appropriate professional.
-
Highlight
you need to assess if the case falls within your scope of competence.
-
Highlight
do you have the necessary skills, training,
-
Highlight
or experience to effectively treat the issues?
-
Highlight
If not, you need to refer the clients to another therapist who has the appropriate skills or qualifications.
-
Highlight
you may be able to treat clients provided you take appropriate measures during treatment to gain the necessary competence.
-
Highlight
could do a literature review on treating this condition and seek supervision on the case.
-
Highlight
if you are working within an agency setting, you will need to evaluate if the services the clients are seeking fit within the agency’s scope of practice.
-
Highlight
Some agencies specialize in addressing specific issues or problems, and may not want therapists working with clients who are seeking help for other concerns.
-
Highlight
Seek consultation with your supervisor if these concerns arise, especially if there is any ambiguity around whether the issues fit under the agency’s scope of practice.
-
Highlight
there may be occasions where your clients’ needs are best met by working on other goals first before addressing the goals with which they initially present.
-
Highlight
You will need to present a rationale to your clients as to why a particular sequence of treatment will ultimately be in their best interest.
-
Highlight
Client goals are often defined in terms of what problems or issues need to be resolved. In contrast, therapist goals generally reflect what changes clients need to make to resolve their problems. Client goals tell the therapist where they want to go, whereas therapist goals describe how the client will get there.
-
Highlight
Many clients not only bring in expectations about what therapy will accomplish, but also about how therapy will be done.
-
Highlight
helpful to assess what clients expect therapy will be like.
-
Highlight
Whenever a client has had previous therapy, it is often beneficial to explore what the experience was like, as it can strongly shape (both positively and negatively) a client’s expectations regarding therapy.
-
Highlight
What did the client find most useful? What about the process didn’t work for him or her? More specific questions will generate a clearer picture of what occurred and how you might apply it to the current therapy situation.
-
Highlight
the therapist may need to educate clients about the therapy process
-
Highlight
Clients may hold expectations about therapy in a number of different areas.
-
Highlight
You need to assess if their expectations align with what you think is realistic.
-
Highlight
Clients can also have expectations about who will be in therapy.
-
Highlight
It is also important that the therapist and client share similar views on the purpose of therapy.
-
Highlight
If the therapist and client are not on the same page in this regard, then problems are likely to arise.
-
Highlight
The therapist and client will need to discuss what therapy is about and hopefully reach a mutually agreed-upon understanding.
-
Highlight
It is also possible that other client expectations may impede the therapeutic process.
-
Highlight
In some instances, you may decide against continuing therapy because the expectations are too restrictive and would severely limit your ability to be effective.
-
Highlight
Clients come to therapy with varying degrees of motivation.
-
Highlight
The initial interview is a good time to assess and perhaps begin to build motivation for therapy.
-
Highlight
A logical time to assess motivation is when you are defining goals for therapy. Answers to the question “What brings you to therapy?” will differentiate motivated from unmotivated clients.
-
Highlight
some of these clients can become quite committed to therapy as they experience its benefits.
-
Highlight
You should also inquire as to who first suggested therapy or called for the appointment. Generally this person is the most motivated for therapy. A good question to ask your clients is what led them to come
-
Highlight
to therapy now, rather than sooner or later in their lives?
-
Highlight
Where clients are on the Stages of Change Cycle
-
Highlight
may determine their motivation for change. This cycle recognizes that clients spend a great deal of time (precontemplation and contemplation stages) thinking about changing before they decide to take action and change. In addition, the cycle recognizes that maintaining changes,
-
Highlight
can be challenging. Thus, addressing relapse is part of the process leading to permanent change. The therapist must match his or her interventions to where the client is in terms of their stage of change.
-
Highlight
Motivational interviewing
-
Highlight
suggests that the therapist’s job is to help the client resolve his or her ambivalence about change. Instead of using confrontation, the empathic therapist validates the client’s perspective and freedom to decide.
-
Highlight
Pain around unmet needs often drives clients to change.
-
Highlight
it is important that you are clear on what the unmet needs are for your clients, and how much pain or distress they experience around these unmet needs
-
Highlight
You will need to figure out why the client is minimizing the problem, which will guide how you approach the situation.
-
Highlight
it can helpful to explore with clients why others believe there is a problem and the possible negative consequences of not addressing it.
-
Highlight
Sometimes clients will deny that a problem exists out of fear of consequences or injury to their self-image.
-
Highlight
Therefore, building motivation for therapy will need to be done in conjunction with addressing the client’s denial
-
Highlight
If a mandated client refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists, you can suggest that there is at least one problem—he or she is being told to come to unwanted therapy. If your client agrees (which is typically the case), then you can explore what needs to happen so that the client is no longer required to come to therapy. This approach allows you to join with your client, while at the same time working on intermediate goals that address the problem.
-
Highlight
Some clients may have poor motivation because they do not anticipate any benefit from therapy, believing that therapy is useless or the situation is hopeless.
-
Highlight
Building a positive expectation that therapy can be helpful will be vital for these clients
-
Highlight
For clients who lack confidence in their ability to change, you may need to highlight their strengths or help them challenge their negative self-talk. Noting exceptions to the problem might help build confidence and motivation.
-
Highlight
Using the above strategies does not guarantee client motivation.
-
Highlight
In these situations, you need to become comfortable with using the leverage for change provided by the courts.
-
Highlight
A common struggle that beginning therapists may face is when they are more motivated than their clients.
-
Highlight
This dynamic suggests that the therapist needs to step back, review the reasons for therapy, and once again evaluate the clients’ motivation.
-
Highlight
At times, clients might seem motivated “for the wrong reasons.”
-
Highlight
You don’t need to agree with the clients’ motivations. Usually, it is enough that clients, for whatever reason, will face the demanding process of change.
-
Highlight
key issue that the beginning therapist must frequently deal with in the initial session: the issue of credibility.
-
Highlight
In order for clients to have hope or an expectation of change, they must see the therapist and therapy as credible, or they may prematurely terminate therapy.
-
Highlight
assess early on if any issues of credibility need to be addressed.
-
Highlight
do the clients see therapy as an effective way to solve problems?
-
Highlight
do the clients see you, in your role as the therapist, as being competent or credible?
-
Highlight
If you suspect there is a credibility problem, you should attempt to pinpoint where and why credibility is lacking.
-
Highlight
The more precise your understanding of why the client does not see you or the therapy as credible, the more likely your intervention will be “on target” in addressing this issue.
-
Highlight
In cases where clients are resistant to therapy in general, you may be able to reframe the process in a way that builds its credibility.
-
Highlight
you must work to reduce the stigma. You can compare therapy to coaching, in that even the best athletes,
-
Highlight
use coaches.
-
Highlight
When clients question a therapist’s credibility, they usually focus on the lack of professional or life experience. Often you can redefine for the client what type of experience is needed to be helpful.
-
Highlight
If you are concerned about your age and lack of experience, it may also be helpful to dress professionally and present in a professional manner.
-
Highlight
you may need to directly address with your clients how you will compensate for your lack of experience with a particular problem or population.
-
Highlight
you might express your willingness to learn from them about their culture.
-
Highlight
While some clients are open to this approach, others will feel it is not their responsibility to educate the therapist about their culture.
-
Highlight
Especially for these clients, it will be important for you to take the initiative to educate yourself through reading the literature.
-
Highlight
If clients still harbor doubts, a frequently effective strategy is to contract with them for a set number of sessions (perhaps three). This gives you time to demonstrate your competence.
-
Highlight
Nearly all clients are willing to give you this chance, provided the number of sessions is reasonable.
-
Highlight
In these situations, you need to identify a problem that can be quickly resolved to build credibility with your clients.
-
Highlight
It is important that you not become defensive if your credibility is being questioned. If you can deal with your clients’ concerns in a nondefensive and respectful manner, this may actually build your credibility.
-
Highlight
you must be clear in your own mind what you do have to offer, even if you have limited clinical or life experience
-
Highlight
you need to recognize that clients value having someone compassionately and respectfully listen to their story at a difficult time in their lives.
-
Highlight
In simply being present with another human being, you have something important to offer your clients.

Ackerman sought out to understand a family to diagnose problems and develop family treatment. He was a child psychiatrist. He worked at the Menninger Clinic. In 1937, he became the chief psychiatrist of the Child Guidance Clinic. He followed the child guidance model of psychiatry to treat the child while the social worker saw the mother. He began having the same therapist see both the mother and child around the 1940 s. he began to see the family as the basic unit of treatment. In 1955, Ackerman organized the first session on family diagnosis at the Meeting of American Orthopsychiatric Association. <a data-href="Don Jackson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Don Jackson</a>, <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a>, <a data-href="Lyman Wynne (1954)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/lyman-wynne-(1954).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lyman Wynne (1954)</a>, and <a data-href="Nathan Ackerman" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/nathan-ackerman.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nathan Ackerman</a> learned about each others' work and joined in a common practice. The Family Institute was founded in 1960. They renamed the Family Institute to Ackerman Institute following his death in 1971. He believed, even though families may give the appearance of unity, underneath they are split into competing factors. <br>His ideas were similar to the <a data-href="Psychoanalytic Family Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Psychoanalytic Family Therapy</a> model
Despite the apparent unit of personality, families are actually minds in conflict driven by warring drives and defenses. He believed families confront some issues while avoiding others, such as conflicts involving sex and aggression. He saw his job as bringing the family secrets into the open. He was unrestrained to encourage families to relax their emotional restraint. He first sided with one member of the family and later with another. He believed balance was achieved in the long-run by moving back and forth in giving support now to one, later to another family member. He was described as unabashingly blunt. He stated people get more reassurance from honesty than from false promises. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/nathan-ackerman.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/People in CFT/Nathan Ackerman.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:26:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Multiple Impact Therapy (1967)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This details the internal communication process and can be used to teach about internal and relational processes. The ingredients questions are used to help people understand their interactions with others. When you may experience a troubling interaction, use the following seven questions to walk through the 'Ingredients of an Interaction'
DESC Model: Utilize to discuss conflict or requests for change.
“DESC Model.png” could not be found. What do I HEAR and SEE? Describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. Similar to the DESCRIBE in the DESC Model. What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see? Discuss how you interpreted the behaviors you heard and saw. Meanings often connect back to past experience. What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make? This helps identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. Similar to EXPRESS in the DESC Model What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? This asks whether you can accept or tolerate your feelings. If a person is not accepting, communication stances will be triggered. Similar to EXPRESS in the DESC Model What DEFENSES do I use? During communication, we may use one of the five communication stances to respond to interaction with others. Below are the four survival stances. Placator

This is a 'yes man' who talks as though they could do nothing for themselves; they must always get someone's approval. They may experience feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit during conflict or disagreement. You may think of yourself as really worth nothing. You are lucky just to be allowed to eat. You owe everybody gratitude, and you really are responsible for everything that goes wrong. Naturally, you will agree with any criticism of you. You are grateful that anyone even talks to you, no matter what they say or how they say it. You would not think of asking anything for yourself. After all, who are you to ask? Besides, if you can just be good enough, it will come by itself. Think of yourself as being physically down on one knee, wobbling a bit, and putting out one hand in a begging fashion. Keep your head up so your neck will hurt, your eyes will strain, and in no time at all your head will ache. When you talk in this position, your voice Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. Acknowledge Other/Context Minimizes self (sometimes context)
People-pleasing tendencies Therapeutic Implications: Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs
Assertiveness/clear communication of needs
Less directive therapy methods
Multiple choice options to practice sense of agency Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Key Terms and Concepts/Placating (Placator).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 16:39:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/placator-stance-diagram.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/placator-stance-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family Systems Theory]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia Emphasized theory
Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).
<br>Beginning in 1955, when Bowen started bringing family members together to discuss their problems, he was struck by their <a data-href="Emotional Reactivity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-reactivity.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Reactivity</a>. Feelings overwhelmed reason. Bowen felt families’ tendency to pull him into the center of this <a data-href="Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass</a>, and he had to make a concerted effort to remain objective (Bowen, 1961). The ability to remain neutral and focus on the process, rather than content, of family discussions is what distinguishes a therapist from a participant in a family’s drama.
To control the level of emotion, Bowen encouraged family members to talk to him, not to each other
therapists weren’t immune to being sucked into family conflicts

Bowen, the oldest of five children from a tightly knit rural family, kept his distance from his parents and the rest of his extended family. Like many of us, he mistook avoidance for emancipation.

Marital conflict.
Projection of the problems onto children. Family Projection Process: The process by which parents transmit their lack of differentiation to their children. Emotional fusion in a couple leads to: Conflict, emotional distance, or reciprocal over-and-under functioning. Spouses with unresolved family-of-origin issues create a family environment. An intense focus on one or more children. The child who is the object of the projection process becomes the child most attached to the parents and has the least differentiation of self. Multigenerational Emotional Process: Defined as the family emotional process across multiple generations. In each generation, the child most involved in the family's fusion moves toward a lower level of differentiation of self. The last involved child moves toward a higher level of differentiation.

<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/yyphH8iFmXo" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/yyphH8iFmXo" target="_self">Salvador Minuchin, MD at the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference - YouTube</a> Knowledge is constructed. Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave. Experience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. Problems affect people
Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. Hence, letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams The truth of experience is not discovered, it is created!
Narrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narrative of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new futures. People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-storied aspects of their lives and relationships. Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. Holds a position of curiosity
Cherishes each person/family's unique stories. Invites clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives. Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. Therapist influential, but decentered
Person separate from problem
All problems have exceptions
Opposite of problem is preferred
Preferred story woven into identity
Impact of relationships explored
Deconstruct societal norms
Personal decision-making supported Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. The problem is the problem.
Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family.
<br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a> There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (re-examining) established truths that oppress people's lives. People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems)
People are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. People are not their problems. People can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. Reject categorizing people
In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves with clients. They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis)
Want to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relations. When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relationship to it. Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict.
Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Problems may be regarded as alien invaders. Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)
Open space for new and more constructive views of themselves.
Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy. Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions. <br><a data-href="Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience. Effects Questions (elicit effects of the problem) How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationships?
Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots. Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multi-stories lives. Once people notice how their stories are problem-saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
Then, the therapists asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
Meetings are typically 60 minutes.
Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between). CAUTION: Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories. Instead: Narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories. Counterstory Asking Permission is central to the model. At the start of 1 st meeting, the therapist asks if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy. Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from previous session aloud and asking a question, such as: "Can you tell me about any new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time?" Other times the therapist begins wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations. Therapist use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session. Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem. Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keep a story alive and growing. Collaborative
Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem. Takes notes of what works and what doesn't. Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation.
Therapy is a relationship - a conversation!
Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories. Open space for describing alternatives. Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently. Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments. The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders. Therapists have more questions than answers! It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.
The therapist invites family members to: Evaluate their current situation
Name the problems involved
Evaluate their relationship to those problems
Take a stand in regard to them
Tell more satisfying stories of their lives
Evaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. Private hopes and fears
Family interactions
Contributions of culture of origin
Traditions, legacies Questioning Is that the problem speaking?
Whose values are guiding you in saying that? By exposing discourses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
Is this conversation useful?

Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve. Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice
More qualitative research rather than quantitative studies
Little empirical support currently exists
Randomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist Listen to stories as stories
Be attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story
Ask about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationships
Make sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem'
Unless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences
At some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories
Try to put yourself in their shoes
Do not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them
Listen and ask
Listen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust Listen 'deconstructively' to family's stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings
As families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning
We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'? Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society
Develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work in the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult
There are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play
Deconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that support them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem
Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people
As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families
If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
Who benefits from the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it
As we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem
What are the family's preferred directions?
Counterplot / counter-story
'Standing against' the problem Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
Is the problem always with you? Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives
Double listening
If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled
If a person experiences injustice, they must have a conception of a just world
When we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications Stories need listeners as well as tellers
Attentive witnesses
The therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful
What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive
We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop
We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud
We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems
We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions
In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session
Out intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session
We may invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict... Narrative therapy aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. <br>Reality is socially constructed. (<a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>)
Reality is influenced by and communicated through language. Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality. There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. Telling One's Story A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. Externalization Technique Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. Deconstruction Technique This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. Unique Outcomes Technique To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that does not include your most pervasive problems. Existentialism The belief that the world holds no inherent meaning, and that we all must make our own meaning in life. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dulwichcentre.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dulwichcentre.com.au/" target="_self">https://dulwichcentre.com.au</a>

Rating/Scaling (1 to 10)
Break
After intermission, the therapist will give the client/family compliments, sometimes followed by a suggestion or homework. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Once you know what works, do more of it. If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).
Focus is on solutions, on what works for clients. Respect clients own resources. Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. Future-oriented
Focusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).
The task of therapy is to do something different. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen? The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'
Solution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. What brings you in?
What are your best hopes for this meeting? Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. Changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. Problem talk: Negative
Focuses on the past
Implies permanence of problems. Clients are experts in their own lives. Clients know what they need Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?
The therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. People are resourceful. Problems are normal life-cycle complications. Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. What will you be doing instead? The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems – effective solutions already in their repertoire.
Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.
As the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.
It is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.
Getting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.
Change perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. They begin living in the solution, not the problem. The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. Time limited
Sessions are made one at a time
One may be enough
Typical course includes 3-5 sessions
Clients can return as-needed
Often a week to a few weeks apart
Once you know more of what works, do more of it Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. What do you think the problem is now?
How will you know when the problem is solved?
How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). Asks more about perceptions than feelings. Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.
Consultant
Guardian of the conversation
Don't get bogged down in 'problem talk'
Focus on what is right
Direct clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. Focus on the 'here and now'
The future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. Assumes a position of 'not knowing.' What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
Constructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the client to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represented the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone. So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Developing well-focused goals within the clients' frame of reference
Generating solutions based on exceptions Goal setting

In-Session What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?
What changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? Exceptions When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? Solution-focused therapists intervene and interrupt 'problem talk' before it escalates into demoralizing bickering, blaming and defending, accusations, etc. Agency How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? Coping How have you managed to cope, endure, keep going? Scaling (i.e., making numbers talk) What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?
On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope? Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. How were you hoping I could help you?
Asking for clients' perceptions
Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. How do we know when to stop meeting like this?
Goals should be: Small
Salient to clients
Concrete, behavioral, measurable
Achieveable
Involve hard work
Start of something
Involving new behaviors What will be present? What will be happening?
After hearing and acknowledging the clients' description of the problem and what they've tried to do about them, next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. Specifically, how will you be doing this?
How will the two of you know when you solved your problems? How will things be different?
What will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else? The clearer the goal, the easier to measure progress. Can you tell me more specifically what will be happening when you two are getting along better?
What will you be doing differently? Modest enough to be achievable. Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened?
Invite clients to envision positive outcomes and to activate problem-solving by giving them a mental picture of their goals. Helps clients to look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do things that the problem has been obstructing. Suppose one night there is a miracle and while you are sleeping the problem that brought you into therapy is solved. How would you know?
What would be different?
What will you notice the next morning that will tell you there has been a miracle?
What will your [family member] notice? Helping families see that their problems have exceptions - times when they don't occur. Exceptions are solutions that families already have in their repertoire. Probing for exceptions (e.g., times when the family didn't have the problem) invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. Finding exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail; also since these exceptions just happened, it is more plausible they could happen again. When in the recent past might the problem have happened but didn't (or was less intense or more manageable)?
What's different about those times when the problem doesn't happen?
How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you? How did you manage that?
What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?
How come things aren't worse?
Punctuate with enthusiasm and support
Work to keep solution talk in the forefront. Listen carefully for an exception to the problem, then punctuate that exception by getting more details about it and congratualating the family on it. Connect the exception to the family's goals by asking how the goal would be reached if this exception were to occur more often. The therapist asks: On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now? "It is a 2."
"So, you feel a little better than when you called. How did you achieve this improvement?"
"What do you think you need to do to achieve a 3?" Used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you will be able to avoid losing your temper this week?
What do you have to do to stick to your guns this time? Wow! How did you do that?
To be effective, compliments should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work Team approach with therapist in session and colleagues behind the mirror. Therapist usually takes a 10 minute break near the end of the session to compose a summary message to the clients. The summary messages begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the client's goals, and presession progress and strengths. What I heard you tell me today is that... Did I hear all of you correctly? A statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy. "I'm not surprised you are so depressed." A reflection of the emotional impact on the client. "My sense is that you must really be hurting." Compliments on pre-session changes or strengths "I was impressed by how many things you've tried to make things better." Some content on the client's goals
Suggestions for building on positives Formula first-session task
Do more of what works
Do something different
Go slow
Do the opposite
The prediction task Devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress
Inquire about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the clients' role in attaining it. What's better?
What happened that you liked?
Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that. Wow. That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?
And what else is better? What do you think the next step might be?
How did you keep things from getting worse?
What's your idea about what might be helpful? Sometimes the model is portrayed as an approach that does not permit discussion of the problem, but this is not accurate. When done skillfully, families do not feel rushed. Emotion is not avoided, but it is also not sought or elicited. Therapist is present as a real, genuinely concerned person, but does not engage in unneeded personal self-disclosure. How can we know when to stop meeting like this?
What needs to be different in your life as a result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?
If you wait till all of the family's problems are solved, you will never stop seeing them. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/5.-solution-focused-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/5.

In many contexts, the term 'couple' has replaced 'marriage' because of its emphasis on the bond between family members/individuals. This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage). Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)
With respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).
While the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible). Psychiatrists are physicians whoo specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health and emotional problems. (M.D. needed)
Psychologist study the human mind and behavior. (Masters needed)
Social Workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve problems. (Bachelors degree needed, unless clinical social work which needs a masters level degree)
Counselors assist people with personal, family, educational, mental health, and career decisions and problems. (Masters needed)

Inter Social Work Case management A family's patterns of behaviors influences the individual and therefore may need to be a part of the treatment plan. In CFT, the unit of treatment isn't just the person - even if only one person is 'the client'; it is the set of relationships in which the person is embedded.

MFTs treat a wide range of serious clinical problems including: Depression
Relationship issues
Anxiety
Biopsychosocial-rooted problems Research has shown that CFT is as effective or more effective than standard individual treatments for many mental health problems including: Schizophrenia
Affective Mood Disorder
Substance (Ab)use
Child Conduct Disorder
Anorexia
Autism
Chronic Illness
Couple/Partner Distress Psychiatry raised concern about scope of practice Wanted to keep MFTs from diagnosis Psychology sought amendments to the scope to place restrictions on psychological testing, and some oppose licensure in general. Social Work concerned with title restriction Wanted to call its members MFTs Counselors (ACA) historically most active opponents Opposed MFT licensure all together
Labeled the discipline as a subspecialty of counseling Professionals from many different disciplines may at times utilize family-based interventions, or work from theories or models that are core to the CFT discipline. Does that mean they are CFTs? Profession vs. Practice AAMFT's response 'It's not our intent to define the standards or the scope of practice of any other discipline - social work or psychology, for example, by saying what services they can perform or what training is need to perform those series. "We assume those professions will be diligent in ensuring that their practitioners will only deliver services for which they have had training, and are competent to perform, and that the regulatory boards for those professions will police those who go beyond their competence."

Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son. Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. Family members have a long history and a future together. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).
We need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems. Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts) For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

The goal of therapy shifted from interrupting problematic patterns of interaction to helping clients find new perspective on their lives. When they said reality was constructed, they meant socially constructed. Interpretations are shaped by our context. Interpretation of our experience mediates behavior. Social constructionists place more emphasis on the intersubjective influence of language and culture. Therapy becomes a process of deconstruction, freeing clients from the tyranny of entrenched beliefs. Inherent in most forms of therapy is the idea that before you can solve a problem, you must figure out what is wrong. But solution-focused turns this assumption on its head. The best way to solve problems is to discover what people do when they are not having the problem. Exceptions to a complaint.

The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. Structure became the target of change. Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems. Then, therapists aimed their interventions at those underlying beliefs. More recently, it dawned on therapists that those belief systems do not arise in a vacuum Behavior is shaped by transactions we don't always see.

Process/Content Focus on the process of communication (how people talk), rather than the context (what they talk about) The goal is to get an overview of the presenting problem and arrange to meet. Listen to the description of the problem and identify all members of the family, household, and others who might be involved. Establish connection and engagement. Ask how the problem is affecting other members of the family. You'd like to hear from everyone, at least initially, in order to get as much information as possible. Reminder calls help increase likelihood of attendance. Build alliance with the family. Develop hypothesis about what is maintaining the presenting problem.
Establish rapport.
Gather information.
Introduce yourself.
Orient the family to the therapy room (physical or virtual) and the format of sessions. Invite family members to speak one at a time. Give everyone a chance to be heard. Establish a bond of understanding with each member of the family. <br><a data-href="Process" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>: How did you feel about coming in?
What were your reactions to coming in? Take a family history. Conduct the genogram to diagram the family network. Listen for family life cycle transitions. Search for strengths and resilience. Remain curious and respectful. Explore the process of family interaction by asking questions about how family members relate to one another and inviting them to discuss their problems with one another in session. What is keeping the family stuck?
Share recommendations for treatment. What is maintaining the problem?
Maintain therapeutic alliance. Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?
Challenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. Listen to people's feelings. Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. Step back and observe. When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. Stay calm: You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. Be curious. Display empathy and respect. Review the therapeutic relationship. Say goodbye. Reinforce progress. Review what the family has accomplished. Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges. How will you know when things are heading backwards? And what will you do?
How will you know if it is time to come back to therapy? Check-in with the family following treatment, if possible. The presenting problem

Assess for substance use, IPV, and affairs. Consider assessment tools if needed.
Be aware of mandated reporting. General Practitioner What is your scope of practice? Specialist Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems? Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. All behavior makes sense in context. No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. Family therapists work to see the big picture. Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. Share the following assumptions: A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. Systems theory Systems metaphor
A family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. Social constructionist Textual metaphor
People narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. Skeptical of objective reality.
Reality is constructed. Reality is constructed through language. Reality is negotiated through relationships. Shared meanings coordinate social action. Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. Therapist assumes expert role. Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. Humans are essentially good. All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).
A supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. <br>Examples such as <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication. An individual's behavior and symptoms always make sense in context. <br>All behaviors and symptoms serve a purpose within the system, allowing the system to maintain <a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>.
No one individual controls behavior in a system and therefore no one individual can be blamed for problems in the family. Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).
If the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

Acting or behaving
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers. Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. Deficits in communication and problem solving. High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members) Behavior is maintained by its consequences. Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)
Good relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)
Emotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)
Understand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.
Uncovering hidden/automatic assumptions that keep people stuck. Overgeneralizations
Magnification and minimization
Personalization
Dichotomous thinking
Labeling and mislabeling
Also called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of
The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. This agenda of therapy is educational: Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Identify behavioral goals
Learn techniques to achieve these goals
Facilitate social reinforcement of change Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)
Use of homework assignments
Phase out therapy gradually. Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. Booster sessions Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems: All couples run into conflict. Conflict resolution is a critical skill. Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. Families need problem solving skills Therapy includes: Clinical interview
Rating specific behaviors
Relationship satisfaction questionnaires Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making. Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Imagery
Role-play
Coaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)
Communication training For example: Engaging in an argument without attacking

Mindfulness and meditation
Sensate focus (p. 164)
In vivo desensitization (p. 164) Parents ahve control over the rewards and punishment of children. If parents change the contingencies of reinforcement, the child's behavior will change. Skills are taught in sequence (shaping)
Help parents define the child's positive and problematic behaviors in specific observable actions. Tracking target behaviors
Reinforcing desired behavior through contigent encouragement with incentive charts. <br>Disciplinary tehcniques include <a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> and ignoring the problem behavior. Observe/Assess the frequency of problem behavior, what precedes it, and what reinforcement follows (Behavior Chaining)
Shaping (reinforcing small steps toward change)

Once assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased or decreased. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing approximate behaviors. Ignoring
Rewards Identifying Automatic Thoughts Assist family members in identifying automatic thoughts
To improve the skills of identifying automatic thoughts, clients are encouraged to keep a diary to jot down situations that provoke the thoughts and the resulting emotional reactions. Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. Do not be triangulated! CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'
Blocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary Inclusion of other individuals if necessary
Medication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT
Co-therapy model is allowed
Both individual and conjoint sessions are allowed. Clients may be more likely to divulge information about their past in private sessions. CBFT therapists tell clients they will keep this information confidential, but if it might be influencing the family's current interactions, they encourage the person to share it in a joint session
Secrets

Clarify the cognitive, behavioral, and affective factors associated with family members, dyadic subsystems, and the family environment. Determine the appropriateness of family therapy Including each family members' level of commitment and goals for treatment. Information gathering: Self-report questionnaires, clinical interviews, observation of interactional patterns Initial conjoint interviews: How the couple met, what attracted them to each other, how they developed a deeper involvement, positive and negative life events, prior experiences in therapy. Inquires about the family members' current concerns and strengths of the relationship. Orients the family to the process of therapy by describing the structure and course of CBFT and the roles of therapist and family. Increasing the frequency and magnitude and positive behaviors
Love days

Departing with a kiss
"Work together with the family to develop a series of agreements on how they want to make changes in their relationships to meet the needs of the family members, to help their relationship function effectively, and to interact positively with their environment." (Gurman et al., 2015, p. 36) For sharing thoughts and emotions (p.38)
For listening (p. 38)
For decision-making conversations (p. 38)
"The therapist provides the family with instruction in the use of particular behavioral skills, through didactic discussions and/or other media (e.g., readings, videos). The instruction is followed by opportunities for the family to practice behaving in the new ways." Selective Attention What each person notices about the partner and the relationship Attributions Inferences about determinants of relationship events Expectancies Predictions of what will occur in the relationship in the future Assumptions What each person believes people and relationships actually are like Standards What each person believes people and relationships should look like Socratic Questioning Understanding the underlying issues through evaluations of the logic of thinking Guided Discovery Clarify each person's standards. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of existing standards. If standards need alteration, help revise them to form new acceptable standards. Problem solve how new standards will be taken into account behaviorally. If partners standards continue to differ, discuss ability to accept differences. Normalize emotional experiences, positive and negative
Clarify thoughts, then relate these to emotions
Use questions, reflections, and interpretations to draw out primary emotions
Describe emotions through metaphors and images
Discourage attempts to distract the self from experiencing emotions
Encourage acceptance of the individual's experience by family members For example, asking one family member to recount a particular incident in detail while helping the individual enrich their expression in a way that helps the individual and the family. Schedule times to discuss emotions and related thoughts with your partner/family member
Practice 'health compartmentalization'
Seek alternative means to communicate feelings and elicit support
Tolerate distressing feelings Roles become familiar and predictable
Knowledge and skill deficit
Reluctant to change due to being hurt in the relationship Intimate partner aggression
Infidelity
Individual psychopathology
Health problems
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
Anorexia nervosa Widely evaluated
Found to be efficacious for distressed couples and families and improving relationship functioning
Effective in alleviating distress and improving communication
Effects have been found in relatively brief interventions (lasting 8-12 weeks)
Finding generalize across continents with experienced and student therapists
Most families appear to maintain gains in relational adjustment for up to 1 year. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/4.-cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/4.

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. <br>The three major concepts of structural family therapy are <a data-href="Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Structure</a>, <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a>, and <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a>s. <br><a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> (Couple; Parent; Sibling) Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers'
Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple
Parental
Child/Sibling Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.
Disengaged systems are independent, but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support. Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.
Enmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness can cripple initiative. Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. "The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system."
Disengaged or enmeshed subsystems
Hierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary
Conflict avoidance Detouring which results in a scapegoat
Cross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted) Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).
Families are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of: Normative life cycle transition The arrival of a first child
An adult child leaving home An acute stressor Natural Disaster
Unemployment Single Adult
Coupling
Having Children
Families with Young Children
Families with School-Age Children
Families with Adolescents
Divorce
Blended Families
Launching Children
Later Life Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. All behavior makes sense in context. The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other. <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> refers to those moments in therapy when family members interact directly with each other. <br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> is not necessarily a technique. It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session. Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.
Problems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.
Activate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. Create effective hierarchy: Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).

Take-Away: Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including: Who should attend
How often
Referrals for psychiatric evaluation Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)
Map the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)
Intervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment) Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. Some problems may be treated individually. Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals. Role of the symptoms in the family

Strengths Ask questions about the presenting problem until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family. Assist family members in seeing how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. Briefly explore the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members might take to interact in more productive ways to create a shift in the family structure and help resolve the presenting problem. Greet the family
Ask for each person's view of the problem
Listen carefully
Acknowledge what you hear
Model empathy that family members are temporarily not able to provide
Acknowledgement (feeling heard and understood) releases family members from resentment
Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. Intervention Language: Joined with the Family
Engaged in Reflective Listening
Built Rapport
Acknowledged
Reflected
Summarized
Validated
Elicited
Emphasized
Challenged
Reinforced Maintain an outsider perspective to remain objective, while becoming familiar with family's experiential reality. Unless therapist is allowed to become part of the new system, no change will take place. Respect the family, and its individual members, despite presenting problem (i.e., abuse)
The therapist joins the system in the sense that they accommodate to its style; how people talk, what words they use, how they walk, and so forth. Make contact with each member of the family Greeting, shaking hands (pre-COVID)
Using names
Noticing something unique about each of the members
Find something similar about each person and then allow the family members to recognize the similarity Skills involved in joining: Accommodating: Matching the family's style of language with gestures or subject matter (being 'familiar' to the family) Being interested in the family's interests (i.e., baseball). Validating: Validate the worth of each family member.

Invite family members to speak for themselves. Block interruptions. Assist dyads in finishing conversations without intrusion. Although structural family therapy begins with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be held with individuals or subgroups to strengthen boundaries. Asking family members to change seats. Asking family members to move seats further apart or closer together or turn toward one another. Having separate sessions with individuals or subsystems to strengthen boundaries. Asking one or more members to remain silent during an interaction. Asking questions that highlight a problem boundary area (e.g., do you always answer for your son when he is asked a question?)
Blocking interruptions or encouraging pauses to enable less dominant persons to speak. The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. While taking sides seems like a violation of neutrality, this is done to unbalance and realign the system (note that fairness is achieved because the therapist sides with family members in turn).

Act as a teacher, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Stroke and a Kick: To mother, "You are very helpful." (Stroke)
To daughter, "Mommy sometimes takes away your voice. Can you speak for yourself?" (Kick) After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)
To formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. Should take into account every member. Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. Should not be explained to the family. As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. Use family's language. Use family's content. Include everyone. Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. Realize that there is no perfect reframe. Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. Blocking: Stopping usual transactions. Exaggerating: Encouraging or sustaining interactions. Silence: When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD) Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions) Therapist must be more flexible than the family. Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).

Describe 'who you are' as a therapist. How will 'who you are' as a therapist impact therapy with families?
What are your personal strengths? What are your growth areas? Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recently, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Similar to all family therapy approaches, structural family therapy is not effective in all cases. No research identifies readily observable characteristics shared by failed cases of structural family therapy. Developed to work with poor urban families, at all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and across countries. Indirect empirical support, as research on efficacy has focused on applicability to family treatment. Studies that directly test structural family therapy's efficacy in the treatment of various presenting problems and targeted populations are needed. Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'
Effectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'
Currently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches. Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'
Insufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)
Effective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models. It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works: Randomized control trials
Case studies data
Observations of therapists and clients Collecting qualitative or quantitative Remember: Research lags behind practice in family therapy. Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. Heteronormative
Pathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)
Family mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-i-(8874)/lecture/3.-structural-family-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory I (8874)/Lecture/3.

When working for a CE, have to provide a Notice of Privacy Practices, a disclosure about what information can be shared and what can’t be.
Biggest concerns are about electronic medical records and breaches of confidentiality
Use only HIPAA compliant software which encrypts and has lots of safeguards against hackers including back-ups etc.

People age 65+ = 16% of the population in 2019 (51.1 million) Expected to be 21.6% by 2040. Nearly 1 in 4 older adults were members of a racial/ethnic minority population: African American (not Hispanic): 12%
Asian American (not Hispanic): 13%
Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (not Hispanic): 10%
American Indian and Alaska Native (not Hispanic): 12%
Hispanic: 8%
Persons identifying as two or more groups: 6% In Ohio persons 65+ represented 17.51% of the population (2,046,320)
This represents a 27.31% increase from 2009-2019. 8.3% of persons 65+ in Ohio live below the poverty line. In 2020, a larger percentage of older men (70%) than older women (48%) were married. Of older adults age 65+ living in the community, 61% lived with their spouse/partner in 2020. About 27% lived alone The 2019 median income of older persons was $27,398 ($36, 921 for men and $21,815 for women)
In 2019, 4.9 million people age 65+ lived below the poverty level. Another 2.6 million were 'near-poor' The median household income of older homeowners was $36,200 in 2019. In 2020, 9.8 million Americans age 65+ were in the labor force (working or actively seeking work). Consumers age 65+ averaged out-of-pocket health care expenditures of $6,833 in 2019, up 41% from 2009. In 2019, about 1.1 million people age 60+ were responsible for the basic needs of at least one grandchild under age 18 living with them. During COVID-19, between March and April 2020, the unemployment rate for adults age 65+ more than quadrupled. Negative stereotypes and discrimination (ageism)
Mental deterioration Some cognitive slowing is associated with normal aging (e.g., periodic minor memory difficulties, such as forgetting names or phone numbers or misplacing objects)

Substance abuse
Social isolation, depression, and suicidality Please identify the following for Older Adults: Characteristics
Strengths
Ethnic or Cultural Values What emotional stressors are specific to older adults? What are possible ways to support the client in feeling with these emotional stressors? How can we think about care with older adults as suicide prevention?
As clinicians, what can we do to address the physical limitations that an older adult client may face to make sure these challenges do not impede the treatment process? 26% of adults in the US have some types of disability (61 million)
2 in 5 adults age 65 years and older have a disability
1 in 4 women have a disability
2 in 5 non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaskan Natives have a disability
Adults living with disabilities are more likely to be obese, smoke, and have heart disease and diabetes. 1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years do not have a usual health care provider
1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years have an unmet healthcare need because of cost in the past year
1 in 4 adults with disabilities 45 to 64 years did not have a routine check-up in the past year. Over 3 million children (4.3% of the under-18 population) in the US had a disability in 2019. The most common disability type among children both years was cognitive difficulty
American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) children had the highest rate of childhood disability of all racial groups, at 5.9% in 2019. In the moral model (or religious), disability is seen as having meaning about the person's or family's character, deeds, thoughts, and karma. From this perspective, disability can carry stigma, shame and blame, particularly if the disability is seen as a mark of wrongdoing. It can also be seen as a sign of honor, faith, or strength (although this is less common)
The moral model is very prevalent worldwide and is often depicted in the media The Medical model views disability as resulting from an individual person's physical or mental limitations
The Medical Model focuses on find a 'cure' or making a person more 'normal'
The Medical Model uses the terms 'Disability,' 'Disease,' 'Dysfunctional,' 'Disorder' to categorize type of symptoms, differences in mechanisms, below average based on standardized measure of functioning, that causes challenges in life. “Pasted image 20240410205740.jpg” could not be found. This model 'proposes that what makes someone disabled is not their medical condition, but the attitudes and structures of society. It is a civil rights approach to disability.'

People with disability have the same rights as everyone else in society," and disability, "must not be used as an excuse to deny or restrict people's rights" Using both models, we can begin to see people with disabilities correctly: as human. We must consider how we can become better allies for individuals with disabilities by ensuring that society is accessible (Social Model)

Screening tool for identifying a person's vulnerability to depression in the context of dementia
May be good for people for mild or moderate
Given by caregiver, answers questions about person's mood or belief system. Starts by interviewing Is the caregiver noticing behavioral disturbances? Are they noticing physical signs? Changes to cyclical behaviors? Discuss with caregiver concerns of possible depression, "I'm concerned you may be experiencing depression, let's find a provider that specializes in working with older adults." How to start conversation when concerned Start conversation in calm, straight-forward, compassionate way
Describe what you observed
Can I help you connect with people who can help? Due to added caregiving responsibilities that are necessary for individuals with disabilities, members of families affected by disabilities have an increased prevalence of physical, psychological, and relational distress. Parents, spouses, and siblings of children with disabilities experience higher rates of mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression. Caregivers have higher rates of health problems and reports a variety of physical symptoms such as migraines, heart conditions, and sleep problems. The mental and physical health effects lead to reports of decreased quality of life and general wellbeing. Many of the adverse physical, mental, and relational health effects described by family members of individuals with disabilities are compounded by a lack of social support. Families often explain that there is a notable deficit in available social support, which they generally attribute to two main reasons: Family members’ lack of free time to socialize with friends and family due to the added caregiving responsibilities
Societal stigma associated with disabilities that may be attributed to personal shame and embarrassment of family members or the disapproval and ostracization by others Clinicians working with families affected by disabilities can support caregivers by connecting them with appropriate online platforms to increase social support, which acts as a protective factor against the harmful effects of caregiver stress and burnout. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/3.-cft-with-specific-populations/14.-older-adults-and-person-with-disabilities.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/3.

Requires us to acknowledge positions of privilege and marginalization in the room. Potential Barriers: In general, therapists are less religious than their clients and the population at large. There is a historic divide between science (psychology) and religion
In the United States there is a desire to maintain separation between church and state
Some therapists avoid the topic to avoid imposing their own beliefs
Some therapists lack confidence in how to address religion and spirituality ethically and effectively. An organized system of beliefs, rituals, practices, and community, oriented toward the sacred. Tends to focus on formal organizations with specifically defined and widely accepted beliefs, practices, and traditions. Transcendent beliefs and practices lived out in daily life and relationships. It can be experienced outside religious structure. "A process through which people seek to discover, hold on to, and when necessary, transform whatever they hold sacred in their lives." Spiritually integrated psychotherapy is based on findings in psychotherapy research and the psychology of religion. It is the practice of purposefully assessing clients' spiritual/religious belief systems and worldviews in the context of psychotherapy, while integrating spiritually oriented interventions. Clinical
Spiritual
Moral Any inquiry about topics commonly related to spiritual themes (i.e., meaning making, coping, social support, and morality) Explore client's worldview and/or personal philosophies
Listen for client's use of 'spiritually laden' words
Explore client's current experience of congruence Acknowledge client's spontaneous statements of spiritual beliefs' Inquire about their spiritual beliefs and practices
Inquire about how they connect spiritual, clinical, and moral dimensions of life. Express agreement with the client's spiritual beliefs or sensibilities when such self-disclosure could be therapeutic. Articulate client's dilemma without giving your own position. Point out contradictions between the client's beliefs and clinical realities or moral issues. Challenge the client's way of handling spiritual beliefs based on your own spiritual, moral, or clinical beliefs. Any method of direct inquiry about a client's spirituality or religion. The purpose of spiritual reflection is twofold: Understand ourselves in our work with clients
Understand clients from their own point-of-view Increasing our understanding helps us fulfill the role of spiritually integrated therapists by not placing our beliefs and/or bias onto the client. Questions to consider: How are these clients encountering a search for meaning?
How do these clients and their presenting problem represent a theme from religious tradition or spiritual worldview (e.g., hope, reconciliation, pillars of faith)
Regarding this case, what is an experience of the sacred/divine/spirit? Spirituality and religion as distinctive concepts
Ethical implications of integration religion and spirituality in practice
Start with a strong understanding of one's own social location
<img alt="Spiritual.Religious Assessment.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/spiritual.religious-assessment.png" target="_self"> 'Indigenous' describes any group of people native to a specific region. In other words, it refers to people who lived there before colonists or settlers arrived, defined new borders, and began to occupy the land. The term 'indigeneity' has emerged to describe the state of being indigenous or related to Indigenous-ness. There are over 476 million indigenous people living in 90 countries across the world, accounting for 6.2% of the global population: Of those, there are more than 5,000 distinct groups. Healing-informed care is care based on Indigenous wisdom about wellness and what is necessary to heal. Balance
Relational
Strength-based Healing has been defined as 'transition toward meaning, wholeness, connectedness, and balance.' Holistic: Interconnectedness underlies all of human experience Balance: Because of the interdependencies of all life, achieving and maintaining balance is important both to the individual and the larger group. Moral Code: The physical and metaphysical worlds are linked to a moral code. Respect: Respect of all living things and each other is essential for balance. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diversity/lecture/2.-race,-religion,-and-gender/6.-examining-spirituality,-religion,-and-non-western-indigenous-methods-of-healing-and-native-americans-and-alaskan-natives.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diversity/Lecture/2.

Bibliography:
Type: Book
Title: Counseling the culturally diverse: theory and practice, Author: Sue, Derald Wing; Sue, David; Neville, Helen A.; Smith, Laura; Publisher: Wiley,
Location: Hoboken, NJ,
Year: 2022 ISBN: 978-1-119-86190-4
"For over four decades, Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice (CCD) has been considered the "gold standard" in culturally competent mental health care. Its cutting-edge presentation of multicultural counseling and therapy (MCT) is used in an overwhelming majority of graduate training programs in counseling and clinical psychology, and it has produced generations of culturally sensitive mental health practitioners. It now forms the multicultural knowledge base of licensing and certification exams at both the masters and the doctoral levels in psychology. In 2021, Social Science Space identified the book as one of the most important works across social science disciplines that has contributed to the ongoing need to understand, analyze, resist, and dismantle racism, bias, and bigotry. In essence, CCD has become a "classic" in the field of mental health practice, and leads the profession in the theory, research, and practice of MCT. CCD upholds the highest standards of scholarship, and is the most frequently cited source in multicultural psychology and mental health. The expert and global perspectives of the four co-authors, each active researchers and practitioners in the field, strengthen the newly minted ninth edition of CCD. As a result, instructors will note the continued fresh, scholarly, and exciting perspective in the content of CCD, as it continues to rank as the most up-to- date text in the field"--

There are many different factors that have been identified that may make a child more likely to have ASD, including environmental, biologic, and genetic factors. Although we know little about specific causes, the available evidence suggests that the following may put children at greater risk for developing ASD: Having a sibling with ASD
Having certain genetic or chromosomal conditions, such as fragile X syndrome or tuberous scierosis
Experiencing complications at birth
Being born older parents Developmental monitoring (collecting or gathering information) and screening (testing). Surveillance or developmental monitoring is an active ongoing process of watching a child grow and encouraging conversations between parents and providers about a child's skills and abilities. CDC's Learn the Signs Act Early program has developed free materials, including CDC's Milestone Tracker app, to help parents and prociders work together to monitor children's development and know when there might be a concern and if more screening is needed. Screening is when a parent or provider completes a checklist or questionnaire specifically designed to identify problems that need further evaluation. General developmental screening should occur at the 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well child visits and whenever a concern is expressed. Autism-specific screening should additionally occur at the 18- and 24- or 30-month visits and whenever a concern is expressed. 1% of the population
Unclear whether higher rates reflect expansion of diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, or true increase. Intervention and support may mask difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the severity of the condition, developmental level, and chronological age; hence the term spectrum. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple sources of information: clinical observations, caregiver history, self-report (when possible) 'Red Flags' for autism. Do not use this language when discussing symptomatology. DSM-5 perpetuated that "only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work independently in adulthood; those who tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills."
DSM-5-TR: While it was once the case that only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder lived and worked independently in adulthood, as diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made more frequently in those who have superior language and intellectual abilities, more individuals are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills and thus are productively employed. Access to vocational rehabilitation services significantly improves competitive employment outcomes for transition-age youth with autism spectrum disorder. In general, individuals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently. 1 in 11 children
Boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as girls

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, it is estimated that 5-10% of adults suffer from depression. Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. More women are affected by depression than men. Depression can lead to suicide. There is effective treatment for mild, moderate, and severe depression.

Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain, or heart disease. Certain medications, such as high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills. Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence
Neglect
Abuse or poverty May make some people more vulnerable to depression Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical, or pessimistic. People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression. Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression. Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems. Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide. Depression can run in families.

Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other functioning.
The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Not better explained by another disorder. There has never been a manic or hypomanic episode. The DSM-5-TR is not specifically designed for collective diagnosis. Understanding depressive disorders in fmilies requires exploration of the etiological aspects shaping the development of depression. We are born into families
Family systems theories provide us with a framework for understanding individuals within context. Depression is an interaction of a family member's inner experiences and various outer systems affective the individual within the family. Relational and cultural factors influence depression. There are familial risk factors for depressive disorders
Families shape views about the disorder and influence treatment
Families are sources of strength and support
Caregiver burden is important to consider
There are systemic implications for treatment (relationships with other providers, particularly with primary care providers/behavioral health)
Twin and adoptive studies
The description, definition, assessment, and management of depression are influenced by cultural factors (e.g., gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, SES, etc.) Psychotherapy

Bipolar and Related Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[
The main thing to remember about the difference between Bipolar I and II, Mania is more problematic and have more disturbing behavior. Impulsive spending, gambling, and sex. May put themselves in risky situations (involving money, sex, drugs), some may be hyperfocused. Full blown mania usually have serious consequences. Some part of their life was profoundly impacted. Think about the time part. Severe because it can lead to serious consequences. How long did it last. Bipolar I and II is not a difference. Is it lasting for a long period of time or a short period of time? It is a common misperception that children cannot have bipolar disorder. Although most people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood, the symptoms can appear earlier in childhood. In children, happiness, silliness, and “goofiness” are normal in many social contexts; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet the Criterion A mood requirement of abnormally elevated mood. For the happiness or silliness of a child to meet Criterion A, it must be distinctly increased from the child’s baseline and accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that to those who know the child well are clearly unusual for that child. For a child’s symptoms to meet criteria for a manic episode, the symptoms must also meet Criterion B for mania and must also represent a change from the child’s usual baseline.
In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the child’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.
The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal association with other symptoms of mania.
The peak age at onset of bipolar I disorder across studies is between 20 and 30 years, but onset occurs throughout the life cycle. Special considerations are necessary to apply the diagnosis in children. Because children of the same chronological age may be at different developmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “expected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her own baseline in determining whether a particular behavior is “normal” or evidence of a manic episode. Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier than for major depressive disorder. Age at onset does not reliably distinguish between bipolar I and II disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode. Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter. The vast majority of youth with cyclothymic disorder experience the onset of mood symptoms before age 10. Bipolar I Disorder
Bipolar II Disorder
Cyclothymic Disorder Bipolar I disorder is a manic-depressive disorder that can exist both with and without psychotic episodes. Bipolar II disorder consists of depressive and manic episodes which alternate and are typically less severe and do not inhibit function. Cyclothymic disorder is a cyclic disorder that causes brief episodes of hypomania and depression. Bipolar I (Mania)
Bipolar II (Hypomania) Lasts at least one week, or any length if hospitalized due to mania Abnormal and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy. During Criterion A symptoms, three or more of these symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity
Decrease in need for sleep
More talkative than baseline or fast talking
Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
Distractibility (reported or seen)
Increase in goal-oriented activity (especially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose
Excessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (e.g., unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretion or foolish business investments) Mood disturbance severity Causes marked impairment in social or occupational functioning OR
Requires hospitalization to prevent harm OR
There are psychotic traits Differential diagnosis Substance use and medical causes are ruled out Distinct period that lasts at least four consecutive days and is present most of the day, nearly every day. Abnormally and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy. In context of Criterion A above, three or more of these symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) have persisted and are markedly different from baseline and have been present to a significant degree. Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity
Decrease in need for sleep
More talkative than baseline or fast talking
Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
Distractibility (reported or seen)
Increase in goal-directed activity (socially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose
Excessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions or foolish business investments) Unambigious change in functionining not characteristic of the person when not symptomatic
Mood disturbance and change in function are observable by others
Episode does not cause significant impairment and is not severe enough to require hospitalization If there are psychotic features, it is a manic (not hypomanic) episode. Not attributable to different diagnosis Substance use and medical causes are ruled out Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day
Significant weight loss or gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day
Insomnia or hypersomnia
A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)
Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode. During the above 2 year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time. Specify if: With anxious distress With anxious distress
With mixed features
With melancholic features
Atypoical features
With psychotic features
With catatonia
With peripartum onset
With seasonal patter
Rapid cycling (Removed) Bipolar does not operate solely in an individual, but appears in relationships with disturbing force
The challenges of bipolar are shared with families
Family systems also impact the disorders' course and treatment. How do family members respond to the affected members?
How much support is offered?
How does the family respond to stressors?
How do the larger support systems impact family functioning?
Bipolar affects and is affected by the family system. Treatment is enhanced when family members understand the course and treatment of bipolar, and offer support. Identifying information

Diagnostic Principles]]></title><description><![CDATA[
DSM-TR is a manual for assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders and does not include information or guidelines for treatment of any disorder. Determining an accurate diagnosis is the first step toward being able to appropriately treat any medical condition, and mental disorders are no exception. DSM-5-TR is helpful in measuring the effectiveness of treatment, as dimensional assessments will assist clinicians in assessing changes in severity levels as a response to treatment. 1840: Category 'insanity' first attempt to quantify and name psychiatric diagnoses. 1844: APA published a predecessor of the DSM: A classification of institutionalized mental patients Early 1900s: First description of schizophrenia by Emil Kraeplin. 1917: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, included 22 diagnoses. 1952: First DSM, 130 pages long, 106 disorders 1994: DSM IV, 886 pages long, 297 disorders 2000: DSM IV-TR, 943 pages long, 365 disorders 2013: DSM 5, 991 pages long, 157 disorders 2022: DSM-5-TR, 1050 pages long A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from dysfunction in the individual, as described above. The DSM is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria which facilitate diagnosis.
It is the standard reference for clinical practice in mental health. Please also be familiar with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-10 Codes) The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continues to evolve.
Too rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... the degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder).
Clinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress. Reliable diagnoses are essential for: Guiding treatment
Identifying prevalence rates
Identifying clients for clinical research
Documenting public health information Standardizes billing and coding
Standardizes diagnoses and treatment
Guides research
Guides treatment Oversimplifies human behavior
Increases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis
Provides labels, which can be stigmatizing Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders.
Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation. Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process.
Integrates measures administered at initial interview and over time to track symptom status and response to treatment. A categorical approach to assessment relies on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity. Ask Categorical (Yes/No)
Ask Frequency (How often?)
Ask Intensity/Severity (Rating: mild, moderate, severe)
Ask Duration (How long does it last?) Disorder-specific and correspond closely to the diagnostic criteria. Some are self-completed by the individual, couple, or family. Interpreted by clinician
Shared back with the individual, couple, or family Others require a clinician to complete Categories: Cognition (understanding and communicating)
Mobility (moving and getting around)
Self-Care (hygiene, dressing, eating, and staying alone)
Getting Along (interacting with other people)
Life Activities (domestic responsibilities, leisure, work and school)
Participation (joining in community activities) A generic assessment instrument for health and disability
Used across all diseases, including mental, neurological, and addictive disorders
Short, simple and easy to administer (5 to 20 minutes)
Applicable in both clinical and general population settings
A tool to produce standardized disability levels and profiles
Applicable across cultures, in all adult populations

Involvement of the member and member's family in the assessment and his or her preferences or referrals to services.
Sufficient data to support findings on all axes of the current Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM), and any differential diagnosis. Understanding the cultural context of illness is essential for effective diagnostic assessment and treatment.

A group of disorders that are typically characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. Disturbances in sexual response or sexual pleasure. Clinically significant. Destigmatize clinical assessment of sexual dysfunctions. Understand the risk factors. Assess for sexual functioning in the clinical interview. Remember that in many couples, underlying sexual dysfunctions exacerbate the presenting problem - whether that be issues in intimacy, communication, conflict resolution, infidelity, mood disorders, etc. Conduct the evaluation in comfortable surroundings and ensure privacy
Be empathic, nonjudgmental, and understanding
Preferably use the language in which patient is comfortable
Use neutral terms (as opposed to vulgar terms) and proper medical terms as long as there are in common usage (e.g., use 'penis' and 'vagina,' but perhaps 'lips' rather than 'labia')
Use anatomical drawings to understand patients knowledge and explain sexual issues to the patient
Reassure the patient that sexual dysfunction or adjustment problems are common and treatable. ("It is common for some people to...")
Explain things in simple, clear and specific terms. Some patients may not be able to understand the language which is commonly used by clinicians and may feel embarrassed to admit this. Hence, whenever new terms are used, provide alternatives or explanations. Check with the patients that they understand the terms used
Start with general, non-threatening questions first (e.g., "Do you have a regular partner?") then ask more specific and potentially embarrassing questions (e.g., "Do you also experience this problem when you masturbate, that is, when you touch or stimulate yourself?")
Assumptions must be avoided (e.g., sexual orientation, numbers of partners, sexual practices)
If a couple has presented together, gather the information for a sexual history from each individual separately (i.e., not in each other's presence)
Conduct the evaluation in presence of a female attendant/relative while examining patients of opposite gender
Make sure that the 'problem' does not just reflect a lack of knowledge or unrealistic expectations on the part of the presenting individual or their partner. Understand the cultural and religious factors which influence sexual issues
Although sexual dysfunction may occur in isolation, in many cases there may be co-existing problems contributing to the dysfunction (e.g., relationship difficulties, psychiatric or physical illness) - prioritize the treatment goals in such situations
Assess psychological sophistication and motivation of the patient/couple Bio / psycho / social
Trauma
Insecurity
Exposure / Introduction to Sex
Distraction
Depression
Anxiety
Poor Communication
Myths
Self-Image
It is usually not just one thing. There may be multiple drivers. Remember, all behavior makes sense in context. Rule out physical / biological, then proceed to psycho / social contributors. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/diagnosis-(hdfs-8881)/lecture/12.-sexual-dysfunctions;-gender-dysphoria;-paraphilic-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Diagnosis (HDFS 8881)/Lecture/12.

Scattered
Not alone
Disjointed
Disconnected Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person think, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem as though they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities. Delusions
Hallucinations
Disorganized Thinking (Speech)
Disorganized or Abnormal Behavior
Negative Symptoms (Mood) Altered perceptions (e.g., changes in vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste), abnormal thinking, and odd behaviors. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality and experience themselves and the world in a distorted way. Specifically, individuals typically experience: Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there
Delusions, which are firmly held beliefs not supported by objective facts (e.g., paranoia - irrational fears that others are 'out to get you' or believing that the television, radio, or internet are broadcasting special messages that require some response)
Thought Disorder, which includes unusual thinking or disorganized speech. Loss of motivation, disinterest or lack of enjoyment in daily activities
Social withdrawal
Difficulty showing emotions
Difficulty functioning normally
Specifically, individuals typically have: Reduced motivation and difficulty planning, beginning, and sustaining activities
Diminished Pleasure in every day life
"Flat Affect", or reduced expression of emotions via facial expression or voice tone. Problems in attention, concentration, and memory
For some individuals, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more prominent and interfere with activities like following conversations, learning new things, or remembering appointments. Specifically, individuals typically experience: Difficulty processing information to make decisions
Problems using information immediately after learning it
Trouble focusing or paying attention Schizophrenia
Schizoaffective Disorder

Emotionally focused couple therapy (EFT) is an empirically validated attachment based approach to couple therapy. From an EFT perspective, sexual functioning is viewed within the context of an attachment bond, but sexual satisfaction in EFT has not been empirically tested. We examined self-reported sexual satisfaction across 24 months in a sample of 32 couples who received an average of 21 EFT sessions. We found that sexual satisfaction increased across six time points from pre to post therapy and across follow-up (6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and that decreases in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy predicted increases in sexual satisfaction across time. These findings provide evidence that EFT may help couples improve their sexual satisfaction by reducing attachment avoidance in therapy.

Furthermore, sexual satisfaction predicts greater emotional intimacy in romantic relationships” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)“Therapies for treating men with sexual dysfunction also seem to be most effective when they include relational concerns and attention to the interpersonal difficulties expressed” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)“Attachment theory asserts that a securely attached partner in a relationship would be more confident and comfortable with his or her partner during moments of sex and intimacy, and better able to deal collaboratively with differences in preferences and desire” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“Optimally secure sex can be conceptualized as examples of effective interdependence in which both partners’ needs are attended to, resulting in mutual satisfaction” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“Individuals with secure attachment styles also seem to be notably more effective at emotion regulation” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“A secure attachment style is associated with greater flexible adaptation to new situations and exploration of novel environments” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“insecure attachment styles have been linked with fewer positive sexual feelings and more negative ones across multiple studies” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“There are two main styles of attachment insecurity that are typically measured on two dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. High levels of attachment anxiety involve worrying about the availability of close others, whereas high levels of attachment avoidance involve an inflated sense of independence and denial of attachment needs” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“Individuals high on attachment anxiety were reported to emphasize emotional dissatisfactions that occurred during sex, whereas individuals high on attachment avoidance were more likely to describe the physical aspects of sex that were dissatisfying” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“those with high attachment anxiety tend to use sex more readily as a tool for determining the status of” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)“sex for anxiously attached individuals was more likely to increase emotional appraisals (such as feeling loved), be used to sustain a relationship (thus avoiding abandonment), or be used as a way to coax a partner’s love and affection” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)“Partners with high attachment anxiety generally weigh these daily relational and sexual events more heavily in their view of the relationship than do securely attached partners” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)“Higher levels of attachment anxiety are associated with having sex to reduce insecurity or facilitate closeness in a relationship” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)“Individuals with high attachment avoidance have been found to have sex as a means to bolster personal opinions of themselves (attractiveness etc.) and incur bragging rights” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)“Those individuals also more readily rely on self-pleasing mechanisms, including higher levels of masturbation and increased levels of fantasizing about persons other than their partner” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)“individuals high in attachment avoidance generally are less likely to engage in sex for the formation and promotion of relational closeness or emotional connectedness.

The first stage, cycle deescalation, involves helping couples gain an understanding of their negative cycle of conflict, particularly underlying attachment needs and fears. The second stage of EFT, restructuring attachment interactions, involves helping couples explore and express to one another their attachment needs and emotions.

Not having a control group in this study means that we are not able to completely rule out the possibility that changes in sexual satisfaction in this study might have occurred without the EFT intervention” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“The sample was also fairly homogeneous, consisting of relatively high socioeconomic status couples, who were mainly Caucasian and exclusively heterosexual, limiting the generalizability of our results. A further limitation was lack of precision in our measure of sexual satisfaction, the GMSEX” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“which measures sexual satisfaction according to subjective rating scales representing the sexual relationship according to five continua” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“This does not account for the frequency of sex, which is an important part of sexual satisfaction” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“or the importance of sex to the couple relationship.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“Future research should examine change in sexual satisfaction in EFT using a waitlist-control group, should employ more than one measure of sexual satisfaction to increase precision in the measurement of this construct, and should attempt to recruit a larger sample.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“A full examination of sex differences” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“should be examined in the future” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“male but not female partners, displays of sexual desire predicted reductions in relationship-specific attachment anxiety in their partner and reductions in relationship-specific attachment avoidance in themselves across 8 months” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“for female but not male partners, displays of intimacy (i.e., warmth, closeness, and affection) predicted reductions in relationship-specific attachment anxiety and avoidance in their partners across the 8 months” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 16)“we found that sexual satisfaction increased significantly from pre to post therapy with decelerated changed across 2 years of follow-up for couples receiving EFT. We also found that reductions in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy significantly predicted higher sexual satisfaction across time points, suggesting that reductions in attachment avoidance (as facilitated through EFT) may be an important factor toward improving sexual satisfaction for couples over the long term. These results also suggest that attachment avoidance may play a significant role in the sexual relationship of distressed couples, and may have value as a target of change to improve sexual satisfaction for these couples.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 17)]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@wiebeattachmentchangeemotionally2019.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Couples (HDFS 8876)/Readings/@wiebeAttachmentChangeEmotionally2019.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 09:53:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@dohertyDiscernmentCounselingMixed2016]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This article describes discernment counseling, an approach to working with couples where one partner is leaning toward divorce and the other wants to preserve the relationship and work on it in couples therapy. These “mixed‐agenda” couples are common in clinical practice but have been neglected in the literature. The goal of discernment counseling is clarity and confidence regarding the next steps for the relationship, based on a deeper understanding of each partner's contributions. Sessions emphasize individual conversations with each partner. An analysis of 100 consecutive cases found that about half of the couples chose to start couples therapy in order to reconcile, with most of the rest choosing the divorce path. Longer term follow‐up information is also presented.

People constantly construct knowledge, and we function in a perpetual state of assessing the information that is presented to us. Interpreting the perceptions of what we see and what we hear allows us to reach conclusion about the world around us. The investigator's interpretation of information and evidence commonly requires answers to many questions that can lead critical of decisions, action, and outcomes, such as: What must be done to protect the life and safety of persons?
Should force, up to and including deadly force, be used to resolve a situation?
Who will become the focus or subject of a criminal investigation?
What is the best plan to apprehend the person or persons responsible for a criminal act?
Will someone be subjected to a search of their person or of their home?
Will someone be subjected to detention or arrest and questioning for a criminal act?
Will someone have a criminal charge sworn against them?
Will someone be subjected to a criminal trial?
Will someone's liberty as a free person be at-risk?
Will justice be served?
Will the community be protected? The investigator must always be ready to explain their thinking and actions to the court. Thinking must illustrate an evidence-based path to forming reasonable ground for beliefs and subsequent action. Thinking must demonstrate consideration of the statutory law and case law relevant to the matter being investigated. Investigation is the collection and analysis of evidence. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/books/introduction-to-criminal-investigation,-processes,-practices,-and-thinking.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Research Citations/Books/Introduction to Criminal Investigation, Processes, Practices, and Thinking.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:34:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bibliography: Nichols, M.

The Undeclared War: We came to think of asylums as places of cruelty and detention, they were originally built to rescue the insane from being locked away in family attics.
Therapists began to notice that often when a patient got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member.
Patients often improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home.
Parents use their children as a buffer to protect them from intimacy. Small Group Dynamics: Group dynamics were applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group.
The Group Mind (1920) (McDougall) A group’s continuity depends on boundaries for differentiation of function and on customs and habits to make relationships predictable. <br>Field theory by <a data-href="Kurt Lewin" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/kurt-lewin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kurt Lewin</a>. He developed the notion that a group is more than the sum of its parts. Quasi-stationary social equilibrium: changing group behavior requires ‘unfreezing.’ Only after something shakes up group’s beliefs will its members be prepared to change. In individual therapy this process is initiated by the unhappy experiences that lead people to seek help.
More effort is required to unfreeze, or shake up, families before real change can take place. The need for unfreezing foreshadowed early family therapists’ concern about disrupting family homeostasis.
<br><a data-href="Wilfred Bion (1948)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/wilfred-bion-(1948).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wilfred Bion (1948)</a>:
Fight-flight, dependency, and pairing: Some families skirt around hot issues like a cat circling a snake. Others use therapy to bicker endlessly, never really contemplating compromise, much less change.
Dependency masquerades as therapy when families allow therapists to subvert their autonomy in the name of problem solving.
Pairing is seen in families when one parent colludes with the children to undermine the other parent. Process/Content: Experienced therapists learn to attend as much to how people talk as to the content of their discussions. <br><a data-href="Role Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/role-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role Theory</a>: the expectations that roles carry bring regularity to complex social situations.

Roles tend to be complementary. Eventually parents of misbehaving children may become polarized into complementary roles of strictness and leniency. What makes such reciprocity resistant to change is that the roles reinforce each other.
Group and family therapy are similar: Both are complex and dynamic, more like everyday life than individual therapy. In groups and families, patients must react to a number of people, not just a therapist, and therapeutic use of this interaction is the definitive mechanism of change in both contexts.
It turns out that the differences between families and groups are so significant that the group therapy model has only limited applicability to family treatment. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy very different from group therapy.
This feeling of safety among sympathetic strangers cannot be part of family therapy because instead of separating treatment from a stressful environment, the stressful environment is brought into the consulting room. <br><a data-href="The Child Guidance Movement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Child Guidance Movement</a>: It was Freud who introduced the idea that psychological disorders were the result of unsolved problems of childhood.

Repeated experience.
A primary negative injunction, such as "Don't do X, or I will punish you."
A second injunction at a more abstract level conflicting with the first, also enforced by punishment or perceived threat.
A tertiary negative injunction prohibiting escape and demanding a response. Without this restriction the victim won't feel bound. Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer necessary once the victim is conditioned to perceive the world in terms of double binds; any part of the sequence becomes sufficient to trigger panic or rage. Most examples of double binds in literature are inadequate because they do not include all the critical features. An example of a double bind would be a teacher who urges his students to participate in class but gets impatient if one of them actually interrupts with a question or comment. A schizophrenic has to deal with them continually - and the effect is maddening. Unable to comment on the dilemma, the schizophrenic responds defensively, perhaps by being concrete and literal, perhaps by speaking in metaphors. Eventually, the schizophrenic may come to assume that behind every statement lies a concealed meaning. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families cause schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for the tragedy of their children's psychoses. <br><a data-href="Theodore Lidz" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/theodore-lidz.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Theodore Lidz</a>: Lidz refuted the notion that maternal rejection was the distinguishing feature of schizophrenic families.

A corollary of the rules hypothesis is that family members use only a fraction of the full range of behavior available to them. This is what makes family therapy so useful.
Jackson’s therapeutic strategies were based on the premise that psychiatric problems resulted from the way people behave with each other.

Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia Emphasized theory
<br>Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).

In Rome, Maurizio Andolfi worked with families early in the 1970s and established a training clinic that continues to accept clients and students today. In 1974 Andolfi also founded the Italian Society for Family Therapy; in Milan, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her colleagues founded the Institute for Family Studies in 1967. The Golden Age of Family Therapy: While they were struggling for legitimacy, family clinicians emphasized their common beliefs and downplayed their differences. 1960s: The leading approach to family therapy in the 1960s was the communications model developed in Palo Alto. 1970 to 1985: Classic schools of family therapy as the pioneers established training centers and worked out the implications of their models.

To be any kind of competent therapist, you must keep your psychological distance from the supreme artists - the Minuchins, the Milton Ericksons, the Michael Whites.

Making use of the cybernetic metaphor, strategic therapists zeroed in on how family systems were regulated by negative feedback. They achieved results simply by disrupting the interactions that maintained symptoms.

Early family therapists tended to overemphasize negative feedback and resistance to change. <br><a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>: Reinforces the direction a system is taking. Positive feedback can have desirable or undesirable consequences. If left unchecked, the reinforcing effects of positive feedback tend to compound a system's errors, leading to a runaway process. Malignant worry, phobic avoidance, and other forms of neurotic behavior may start out with a relatively trivial concern and escalate into an out-of-control process. Example: a panic attack may start out as a relatively harmless instance of being out of breath, but a panicky response to breathlessness may spiral into a terrifying experience. Feedback loops indicate a basic circularity where each element has an effect on the next, until the last element 'feeds back' the cumulative effect into the first part of the cycle. Thus A affects B, which in turn affects C, which feeds back to A, and so on. To survive and adapt to the world around them, all communication systems - including families - need a balance of negative and positive feedback. The cybernetic system turned out to be a useful metaphor for describing how families maintain stability. Cybernetics was the brainchild of MIT mathematician Norbert Weiner (1948). During WWII, Weiner was asked to design a better way to control the targeting of antiaircraft artillery. Weiner's solution was to incorporate a system of internal feedback that enabled antiaircraft guns to regulare their own operations. The signal used to control the artillery was a self-regulating servomechanism - the technical term for the first automated machines.
He distinguish two modes of information, discrete or continuous - digital or analog.

Part of their appeal was a pragmatic, problem-solving focus, but there was also a fascination with strategies to outwit and provoke families into changing, with or without their cooperation.

The strategic approach introduced two of the most powerful insights in family therapy: Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions.

In 1967 Haley joined Salvador Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
In 1976 Haley moved to Washington DC with Cloe Madanes he founded the Family Therapy Institute. Madanes currently works with motivational speaker and life coach Anthony Robbins. In 1955 Haley moved back to California. He dies in 2007. Jame Keim in California, who developed an innovative way of working with oppositional children, is ably carrying on the Haley-Madanes tradition. Other prominent practitioners of this model include Neil Schiffin Washington DC; Scott Sells at the Savannah Family Institute; and Jerome Price in Michigan. The MRI model had a major impact on the Milan Associates, Mara Selvini Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo, Gianfranco Cecchin, and Guiliana Prata. The Milan Associates eventually split, with Palazzoli and Prata focusing on invariant prescriptions and eventually incorporating more psycho analytic concepts into their work, and Boscolo and Cecchin focusing on circular questioning. Both groups currently have training centers in Italy. Giorgio Nardone is another prominent Italian family therapist who trained at the MRI. In Pragmatics of Human Communication Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson sought to develop a calculus of human communication, which they stated in a series of axioms. People are always communicating. Since all behavior is communicative and since one cannot not behave, then it follows that one cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. The report (or content) of a message conveys information, while the command is a statement about the relationship. <br><a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>: <br>In families, command messages are patterned as <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>, which can be deduced from repeated patterns of interaction. <br>Jackson used the term <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a> as a description of regularity, not regulation.

Homeostatic mechanisms bring families back to equilibrium in the fae of disruption and thus serve to resist change. <br>Jackson's notion of family homeostasis describes the conservative aspect of family systems and is similar to the cybernetic concept of <a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>. According to the communication analysis, families operate as goal-directed, rule-governed systems. Communications theorists didn’t look for underlying motives; instead, they assumed circular causality and analyzed patterns of communications linked together in chains of stimulus and response as feedback loops. When the response to a family member’s problematic behavior exacerbates the problem, that chain is seen as a positive feedback loop.
The advantage of this formulation is that it focuses on interactions that perpetuate problems, which can be changed, instead of inferring underlying causes, which are often not subject to change. <br><a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>: Strategic therapists made the concept of the positive feedback loop the centerpieve of the model. For the MRI group, this translated into a simple yet powerful principle of problem formation: Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how family members respond to it. Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This only produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, and so on - in a vicious cycle. <br>The family system is reacting to a deviation in the behavior of one of its members within feedback designed to dampen that deviation (<a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>), but has the effect of amplifying the deviation (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>).

Find a way to change the rules in order to interrupt problem-maintaining behavior. Jay Haley added a functionalist emphasis to the cybernetic interpretation with his interest in the interpersonal payoff of behavior. Later, he incorporated structural concepts developed during the years he spent with Minuchin. <br><a data-href="Hierarchical Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchical-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Structure</a>: Haley believed that the rules around the hierarchical structure of a family are crucial and found inadequate parental hierarchies lurking behind most problems. Haley suggested that 'an individual is more disturbed in direct proportion to the number of malfunctioning hierarchies in which he is embedded.' <br>To counter a problem's payoff, Haley borrowed Erickson's technique of <a data-href="Prescribing Ordeals" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/prescribing-ordeals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prescribing Ordeals</a>, so that the price for keeping a symptom outweighed that of giving it up. Like Haley, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her associates focused on power games in families and on the protective function symptoms served for a family. They explored families' histories over several generations, searching for evidence to confirm their hypotheses about how children's symptoms came to be necessary. These hypotheses often involved elaborate networks of family alliances and coalitions. They frequently concluded that patients developed symptoms to protect one or more family members so as to maintain the delicate network of extended family alliances. Strategic therapists say little more than whatever works is normal and that what makes families malfunction are solutions that don't work. <br>According to <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>, normal families, like all living systems, depend on two processes: They maintain integrity in the face of environmental challenges through negative feedback. No living system can survive without a coherent structure. Negative feedback resists disruptions Too rigid a structure leaves a system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. That is why normal families also have mechanisms of positive feedback. Positive feedback amplifies innovations to accommodate to changed circumstances. Recognizing that the channel for feedback is communication makes it possible to state the case more plainly: Healthy families are able to adapt because they communicate clearly and are flexible. <br><a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: Resolutely opposed standards of normality. "As therapists, we do not regard any particular way of functioning, relating, or living as a problem if the client is not expressing discontent with it." By limiting their task to eliminating problems presented to them, they avoided taking any positions regarding how families should behave. The Milan Associates: Did not apply preconceived notions or normative models. By raising questions that helped families examine themselves and that exposed hidden power games, they trusted families to reorganize on their own. <br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a> : Assessments were based on assumptions about sound family functioning. His therapy was designed to help families reorganize into more functional structures, with clear boundaries and generational hierarchy. According to communications theory, the essential function of symptoms is to maintain the homeostatic equilibrium of family systems. Symptomatic families were seen as trapped in dysfunctional, homeostatic patterns of communication. These families cling to their rigid ways and respond to signs of change as negative feedback. Change is treated not as an opportunity for growth but as a threat.

One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families usually seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure
Seeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family." Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. "Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them." Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.
Maps the family's underlying structure.
Intervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating
Enactment
Structural Mapping
Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
Boundary Making
Unbalancing
Challenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong
Pushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Virginia Satir <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> and <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a>
Two of the newer models - Johnson's (2004) emotionally focused couples therapy and the internal family systems model - have combined the emotional impact of an experiential focus on the individual with a more sophisticated understanding of family systems.

Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.
The operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Skills taught in sequence.

According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania. The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. <br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy. Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. <br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href="Schemas" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone. Hidden assumptions have a potent impact on how people perceive and react to each other. <br><a data-href="Behavior Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/behavior-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavior Exchange Theory</a>: A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control. A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills. Neil Jacobson (1981): Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. Attention is a powerful social reinforcer. The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)
Even when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.
Others persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. <br>The use of <a data-href="Aversion Control" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills. Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease') Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. <br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up. These schemas are the basis of biased assumptions that poison relationships by distorting family members' responses to each other.

The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out. <br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>: Consists of reinforcing change in small steps. <br><a data-href="Token Economy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/token-economy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Token Economy</a>: Use points to reward children for good behavior. <br><a data-href="Contingency Contracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-contracting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Contracting</a>: Agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their children. <br><a data-href="Contingency Management" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-management.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Management</a>: Giving and taking away rewards based on children's behavior. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a>: Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior. S for stimulus
O for the state of the organism
R for the target response
KC for the contingency of consequences Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. <br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href="Premack Principle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premack Principle</a> is applied. High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. <br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting. Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.
Case Study: Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind. The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession.

Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations. Describe the evolution of solution-focused therapy. Describe the main tenets of solution-focused therapy. Describe the healthy and unhealthy family development from a solution-focused therapy perspective. Describe the clinical goals and the conditions necessary for meeting those goals from a solution-focused therapy perspective. Describe the assessment and intervention techniques of solution-focused therapy. Discuss research support for solution-focused therapy.

Interventions Case Conceptualization and Treatment Plan Complete a theory-specific case conceptualizations and treatment plans for Satir family therapy and emotionally focused couples therapy using templates that are provided. Research Provide an overview of significant research findings for Satir family therapy and emotionally focused couples therapy. Diversity Analyze strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications for using experiential approaches with clients in relation to their social location/diverse identities, including but not limited to ethnic, racial, and/or sexual/gender identity diversity. Cross-Theoretical Comparison Compare how experiential therapies utilize interpersonal patterns (IPs) with other approaches described in this book. Integrating systemic theory with humanism, experiential family therapists are noted for their warmth and direct emotional engagement with clients. These approaches include: The Satir Model

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href="Paul Watzlawick" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href="Richard Fisch" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png" target="_self">
A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. <br><a data-href="Integration of New Possibilities" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Integration of New Possibilities</a> Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?
Is each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness
<br>Accurate <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>
Unconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind
Body
Spirit
Open body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact
Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href="Role of the Symptom" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/role-of-the-symptom.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role of the Symptom</a> in the System <br>Describe how the symptom maintains the family's homeostasis at an emotional level, often regulating closeness and distance (<a data-href="Distance Regulation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distance Regulation</a>; <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>) Family Dynamics Identify salient dynamics Power struggles

Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life.

Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns) This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child? Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. <br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.' The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions. The mind-body connection considers how emotional issues may manifest in the body, either symbolically or functionally.

This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relational, family, or systemic goals
Individual goals The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication: The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.' What do I HEAR and SEE? The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. <br>This is similar to ' <a data-href="videotalk" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href="Solution-Focused Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see? After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. Meanings often connect back to past experiences. What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make? The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: "I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural."; incongruent: "I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.")
Subsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. What DEFENSES do I use? <br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>. What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use? Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'
Most of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques' What is my RESPONSE in the situation? How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?
Incongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change. Satir therapists work with clients to help them express difficult-to-articulate emotions related to the presenting problem. If the clients complain about family members or a difficult life situation, experiential therapists listen closely for the emotions, expressed or unexpressed, that are related to the problem circumstance. They listen not just for the surface emotions, but also for deeper levels of emotion and use questions and empathetic reflections to focus clients on those deeper emotions. If a client tells a story without identifying their emotions directly: "As I listen to you explain what happened to you during that argument, I am getting a sense that you were feeling [name the emotion]. Does that sound right?"
"That sounds like a very difficult situation. Can you share some of the emotions you have been expeirencing as you go through this?" If a client does identify emotions, the therapy can help explore them with questions such as: "You say you were feeling [emotion]. I am wondering if part of you is also feeling [name another emotion that client seems to be experiencing]."
"Can you say more about what feeling [name emotion] feels like for you." Satir coached families in softening rigid family rules by changing them to guidelines. For example, rather than saying "I should not get angry," a client or family was encouraged to revise the limiting rule to "What I am angry, I will express my anger in a way that is respectful to others and myself." Satir encouraged families to have as few rules as possible and to be flexible, adapting them for each context and as children's developmental needs change. <br>Coaching clients in how to have authentic, congruent communication in session, involves the ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' combined with specific communication coaching strategies. When coaching communication, Satir had clients turn their chairs toward one another and gave the clients prompts, such as, "Tell your partner how you feel about what happened on Saturday night." If the client was able to congruently address their partner about this, Satir then prompted the partner to respond in kind, continuing this process until the problem was resolved. When a person had trouble communicating congruently and reverted to a survival stance, Satir interrupted the conversation and suggested how to rephrase the statement or how to make the client's nonverbal communication more congruent (e.g., "Now, can you say that starting the statement with 'I' instead of 'you'?" or "Can you show me the emotion you say you are feeling when you speak to your wife?")

Sculpting involves putting family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family. Either the therapist or the client may direct the sculpting. If family members are directing the sculpting, each person in the family is given the opportunity to sculpt the family as they see it. Sometimes the sculptor assigns each family member to say a line that represents how they may be feeling, thinking, or viewing the situation. Usually, however, the essence of this intervention is to give a nonverbal, symbolic depiction of the family process from each person's perspective. Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses. Through the sculpting process, a person is able to literally see how they are contributing to the problematic family process far more quickly than when the same information is provided with words. When all family members are sculpting, it is generally best to let all family members sculpt how they see the family before allowing discussion of one another's sculpting. Therapists encourage family members to respect each person's subjective experience as illustrated in the sculpting and to use the experience to deepen their understanding of one another. Satir used touch in therapy to initially connect with clients and to encourage and reassure them when they were practicing new ways of communicating. In this way, she underscored emotional context and provided palpable support. She also used touch with children to help teach alternatives to violent behavior and to model for parents how to manage difficult children. In today's practicing environments, touching is generally discouraged because it can easily be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or may make a client feel uncomfortable. Therapists need to carefully consider the legal and ethical issues of using touch. Touch may be appropriate in certain practice and cultural contexts. At minimum, therapists can learn from Satir the importance of coaching clients in touching each other - their children and spouses - in more loving and helpful ways. For example, rather than using a demonstration, therapists can guide a parent on how to hold children who are having a tantrum. <br>A form of psychodrama, the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> is used to allow clients to explore unresolved family issues and life events in the safety of the group setting. <br>The client, who is called the ' <a data-href="Star" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Star</a> ,' first identifies key events in their life chronology and significant sources of influence.

In this way, the therapist facilitates a process in which the client is better able to accept different aspects of the self and to identify the contexts in which these aspects have been and continue to be useful. The language of 'parts' can also be used to facilitate similar discussions and insights in individual, couples, and family therapy.

Title: Protective Factors for Adverse Childhood Experiences: The Role of Emotion Regulation and Attachment, Author: Tanner, Mackenzie A.; Francis, Sarah E.; Journal: Journal of Child and Family Studies, Year: 2025 DOI: 10.1007/s10826-024-02989-7
ISSN: 1062-1024, 1573-2843
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents’ development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n = 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difﬁculties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These ﬁndings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.

(CALM)]]></title><description><![CDATA[
The acute phase of a suicidal crisis is when a person is ready to actually make an attempt to end their life. Suicidal crises are often brief. While some attempts follow a long period of deliberation, other attempts are acted on hastily and may be difficult to predict. Most people who attempt suicide don't necessarily want to be dead, but they want the pain they feel to stop. Most people who attempt suicide and survive do not ultimately kill themselves - even people who make a very serious suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Crisis: The period when a person transitions from being at risk for suicide or considering suicide to being ready to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;make an attempt. Can come on rapidly
Can be difficult to predict
Can lead to an unplanned suicide attempt
People were asked when they has first started thinking about making an attempt; 48% said they starting thinking about it within 10 minutes of attempting. Often brief The period during which a person is actually ready to take their life is usually brief. Rarely is it a chronic state. The impulse to die often fades. It may never recur, or it may flare up episodically. Duration of Suicidal Crisis: Evidence by Attempters: 0-10 minutes: 48%
11-60 minutes: 2%
1-24 hours: 9%
1-7 days: 16%
1-4 weeks: 15%
1-12 months: 11% Long-Term Survival: More than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not actually kill themselves. 60% of people who commit suicide die on their first attempt. (Means reduction saves lives by decreasing the likelihood that an attempt will be fatal) In describing the moment he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, Ken Baldwin said, "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped." It is not easy to determine. Examples: Clients who have suicidal thoughts. Clients who are in distress and have attempted suicide in the past. Clients who are struggling with mental health or substance misuse issues, especially if they are also coping with painful life crises. A clinician should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and feelings. Talking about suicide does not create or increase risk, in fact, it can reduce the risk of suicide. A clinician’s ability to calmly, compassionately, and matter-of-factly explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors may encourage an individual to disclose suicidality, if it exists. Often, clients who have considered suicide will be relieved that you raised the subject. Use direct questions about current or past suicidal thoughts and behavior. Let the client know that other people have similar thoughts and feelings.
Any of your clients who have a prior history of suicidality or current distress could benefit from lethal means counseling. If your conversation with your client results in disclosure of past suicidal thoughts or behaviors, probe more about current suicidal feelings. Find out specific details about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Some Questions to Ask: Tell me about a couple of times in the past few months when things were the worst for you—did you think about suicide? If yes, then ask:&nbsp;Did you take any specific steps toward an attempt? What methods did you think about? What kept you alive?&nbsp; Tell me about the last couple of days—how much would you say suicide has been on your mind, if at all?&nbsp; If so, then ask:&nbsp;Are there specific methods you’ve thought about? Have you thought about how you'd kill yourself?&nbsp; If yes, then ask: Have you thought about when or where you'd kill yourself?
If they mention a specific method of suicide, then ask: What other methods are you thinking about? Is there a specific scenario where you think you would attempt suicide?
Have you ever attempted suicide in the past, or started to? Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Lethal means counseling makes sense for anyone at risk.
Individuals who struggle with mental health and/or substance use issues, and who are experiencing a major crisis, stress, or trauma, are also at risk of suicide and should receive lethal means training. Individuals who currently have suicidal thoughts would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who struggle with mental health/substance abuse issues, especially when they are also experiencing painful life crises, would benefit from lethal means counseling. Ask clients at risk directly about suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Ask clients at-risk specifically about their suicide plans, such as how and when they would do it. Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. People sometimes deny these even when they exist. Also, suicidal thoughts can emerge rapidly and many attempts are unplanned. Lethal means counseling should take place before a suicidal crisis occurs. Firearms is the method used most frequently in suicidal deaths. Suicidal Death Rates by Method: 51% Firearms
26% Suffocation/Hanging
12% Poisoning/Overdose (Poisoning from intentional drug or medication overdoses)
3% Gas Inhalation (Inhaling gas, usually carbon monoxide from motor exhaust)
2% Jumping/Falling (Jump from high place like bridge)
2% Cutting (Sharp instruments like razor)
4% Other Methods (like drowning) The lethality of the method used in a suicide attempt is one of the biggest factors determining whether the person lives or dies. While the intent matters, means also matters. If the method a person wants to use for suicide if not available when they are actually ready to go through with an attempt, one of two things is likely to occur: They will delay the attempt as they try to get access to the method they want to use. The greater the delay, the greater the chance the suicidal crisis will pass. They will substitute another method. If the substituted method is less lethal, this increases the chance the person will not die. And most people who survive an attempt do not later go on to kill themselves. The two methods used in the majority of nonfatal suicidal attempts are overdosing with medications and cutting with sharp instruments. Many people think these two methods are far more deadly than they actually are. This misperception may save a lot of lives.
We recommend that you do not share specific information with your clients about the low lethality of sharp instruments and medications. Which suicide methods are amenable to a means reduction approach? It depends on the following criteria: Number of Suicide Deaths: The number/percent of suicide deaths caused by a specific method. Lethality: The proportion of attempts by a given method that end in death (case fatality rate). Irreversibility: The inability for someone attempting suicide to stop once it has begun or to be rescued. More people stop an attempt than carry through with it. Accessibility: The immediate availability of the method. Access is particularly important when attempts occur rapidly with little or no planning. Acceptability: Cultural and/or individual tolerance or preference for using a particular method to kill oneself. Cutting: Low Number of Deaths

High Acceptability Firearms are used in more suicide deaths in the US than all other methods combined. They are also highly lethal irreversible, and easily accessible in many homes with guns (one-third of homes have guns). Since gun owners can voluntarily undertake steps to reduce access, you will want to discuss safe firearm storage with all clients at-risk of suicide. Medication Overdoses are not as lethal as firearms (though some medications and poisons are very lethal). It is also usually possible for someone to stop an overdose mid-attempt or to be rescued. However, overdose is by far the most frequent method of attempt, and medications are easily accessible in most homes. Therefore, it is wise to routinely advise at-risk clients to dispose of unnecessary medications and keep accessible only quantities that do not pose a lethal threat. When your client's suicidal ideation focuses on any other method, you will want to discuss with them ways to reduce access to that method. More suicide deaths are from firearms than any other method in the US. Firearms, jumping, and suffocation are most lethal than other methods. Cutting and poisoning/overdose have low lethality, on average. The method used in a suicide attempt can determine whether the person lives or dies. Use a method reduction approach for any lethal method that is mentioned by clients at risk. How amenable each method is to a means reduction approach depends on the following criteria: Frequency
Lethality
Irreversibility
Accessibility
Acceptability Since firearms are used in most suicide deaths and they are also highly lethal, acceptable, and accessible (in homes with guns), be sure to ask all clients at risk if they have access to firearms and discuss ways to reduce access. A method is considered lethal if a high proportion of attempts by that method end in death.
Approximately 80%-90% of intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates.
Only 1%-2% of intentional, self-inflicted wounds from sharp instruments, like a razor, are fatal. Cutting is not a highly lethal method. However, it is the second most commonly used method in attempts. Only 1%-2% of intentional overdoses or poisonings are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates. This is on average, however, certain medications and poisons are far more lethal than others. In addition, medication overdoses are the most common method of suicidal attempts. People who attempt suicide typically struggle with ongoing mental health or substance abuse issues.
While some attempts are planned, many are not. Acute suicidal crises are often brief, and escalation from thought to action can occur rapidly.
The lethality of the method used in an attempt can determine whether that person lives or dies. If a highly lethal means is not available, the individual's chance of survival is greater. Over 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not take their life later on, so reducing access to lethal means can save many lives.
An effective way to protect clients at risk of suicide is to reduce their access to highly lethal means before they experience an acute suicidal crisis. Feasibility: Can the client or their family actually take the steps at home to reduce access to the method? Reducing access to&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;and&nbsp;medications used for poisoning/overdose&nbsp;could feasibly be accomplished at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so could potentially save thousands of lives in the U.S. if routinely implemented with people at risk for suicide.
Access can be feasibly be reduced for these two methods: Firearms: Firearms are used in roughly half of all suicide deaths, are highly lethal, and are very accessible if they are kept at home. Medications: Medication overdoses are by far the most common method in suicide attempts. Although the vast majority do not result in death, some medications and medication combinations are highly lethal - and, if kept unlocked at home, very accessible. We recommend routinely discussing firearm and medication storage with all clients at risk of suicide. If a client's suicidal ideation focuses on a method other than firearms or medication, we also recommend discussing ways to reduce access to that method as well. When discussing firearm storage with clients and their family members, the goal is to maximize the client’s safety by reducing immediate access to firearms as much as possible while they are at risk for suicide. There are two main options for reducing access to firearms.
Safest: Store firearms away from the home: Storing firearms away from home is the most effective way to ensure clients don't have easy access to a gun if they experience a spike in suicidal feelings. Off-site options are listed in the next section. Second-best: Secure storage inside the home: The second-best option is securely locking firearms in the home (or disassembling guns and locking a critical component). The person at risk should not have the keys, know where the keys are kept, or know the combination to the storage unit. Keep in mind that safes and locks can be broken into or picked, some more easily than others. But any measures that put time and distance between a suicidal person and a firearm may save their life. Storing firearms away from the home temporarily until the person improves is the best way to reduce access to them. Self-Storage Rental Units: Many facilities allow firearm storage. Typically, the smallest units are 5 ft. By 5 ft., but some offer storage drawers or bins, which are less expensive. Prices typically include a small one-time administrative fee as well as a monthly charge that depends on unit size. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored in a facility. Friends or Relatives: Storing firearms with a trusted person is an excellent and free option, provided the person is legally allowed to hold them. Some state laws require a background check prior to transfer to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing firearms. Shooting Ranges: Shooting ranges and sportsmen’s clubs sometimes offer locker rentals for a relatively low monthly fee. Typically, only the owner holds the key and no background check is required because the ownership of the guns is not transferred. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored. Law Enforcement: Some law enforcement agencies will temporarily store firearms for safety purposes; others will not. It is best to know the processes and policies in your region before you need to implement these with a client. You or your client should contact the agency first; walking in unannounced with firearms could be mistaken as a threat. Some agencies will pick up the firearms at the person’s home. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required. Most agencies offer disposal services, if that is desired. Gun Shops: Some gun shops offer storage services, and a few specialize in this service (e.g., provide pick-up services, offer discounts for longer-term and multiple gun storage). Prices vary, although some shops will provide regular customers with free storage when there is a safety concern. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required, depending on the type of storage the shop uses. Pawn Shops: Pawning guns for a small loan amount can be a relatively low-cost, secure storage option in most states. Interest charges must be paid monthly. To reclaim their firearms, gun owners must repay the loan and go through a background check to verify they are not prohibited from owning firearms. Clients and family members who decide to store their firearms away from their house usually want to know when it’s safe enough to bring their firearms back into the home. "Yes. … It’s a case-by-case decision based on how the client is doing. Acute suicidal feelings can spike episodically. While these spikes are often brief, they can recur. It is prudent to wait until there has been a relatively long period of stability before returning the guns." Temporary storage of firearms away from the home cannot always be arranged immediately and isn’t always acceptable to the client or others in the home. Store in a gun safe or lock box: Lock guns, unloaded, in a gun safe or lock box. Many gun owners have multiple guns and ALL of them should be locked up, including rifles and self-defense guns. Remove a component: Remove a key component of the guns (such as the slides or firing pins) and lock them up - or better yet, store them away from the home. Use Gun Locks: Trigger locks, cable locks, and clamshell locks aren't as safe as locking in a secure gun safe, but they are better than not locking it at all - and when used in conjunction with a safe, can provide an additional layer of protection. Change the Combination or Key: If guns are already locked, change the combination or key location in case the person at risk knows how to access them. Remove Ammunition: Remove ammunition from ALL firearms. Keep all ammunition out of the home for now - or, at least, locked separately. Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
We recommend triple safety when storing them in the home: Locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked up separately (Ideally away from the home while the client is at risk)
What About a Self-Defense Gun? In some situations, clients or members of their household may want to keep their gun available for self-defense purposes. If this is the case, how you approach the situation and what you say will depend on whether the gun owner or the household member is the person at risk. Person At Risk: If the gun owner is the person at risk: Discuss the specific threats that are a concern to the client and the realistic risk of home invasion crimes.
Find out what other means of protection they would consider, such as self-defense sprays (if legal in your state), flood lights, an alarm system, or a dog.
Discuss what they are willing to do to keep themselves safe from suicide.&nbsp;
Would the client consider locking a self-defense gun and having another family member hold the key? If there’s resistance, consider creative solutions, such as putting pictures of loved ones or other reminders of reasons to live on their gun or lock box to interrupt or slow down a suicidal impulse. Work toward additional steps to reduce access over time. Household Member: If the gun owner is a member of the household: First, discuss the probabilities of suicide attempt versus risk of home invasion in the near term (i.e., the risk of a violent home invasion is very small for most people and is dwarfed by the far greater risk of suicide if a despairing person has a gun close at hand)
If the gun owner is concerned about protecting family members, it may be helpful to mention that part of protecting them is keeping everyone safe from suicide.
If self-defense is determined to be essential, one option is for the gun owner to keep the firearm either on them or in a quick-release handgun safe to which the person at risk has no access. Overdose accounts for roughly two-thirds of suicide attempts treated in the hospital, but only a very small proportion (2% or less) prove fatal. However, some medications are more dangerous than others, especially when taken in combination. With over 250,000 attempts annually, at least 5,000 people die each year from an intentional overdose. According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the medications most frequently involved in overdose suicides are opioids (e.g., prescription pain medications such as oxycodone, methadone, and morphine). 5&nbsp; In suicide deaths by drug overdose, over half tested positive for an opioid. 6&nbsp;Opioids, when used alone or in combination with other types of drugs or alcohol can cause death by depressing the respiratory system. Other drugs that are frequently implicated in overdose deaths include benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolytics and muscle relaxants), antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping pills (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially diphenhydramine—Benadryl), and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). These substances usually do not appear alone but rather in combination with an opioid, with one another, and/or with alcohol. Alcohol use can increase the lethality of an overdose and may increase the risk that the person will carry through with an attempt.
Unfortunately, information about lethal combinations of medications is readily available on the Internet. Safely dispose of all unneeded and outdated medication in the home. Opioids should not be kept at home unless absolutely necessary to manage pain. If opioids must be kept at home, they should be locked and inaccessible to the person at risk. If the at-risk client must take the opioids to manage pain, discuss the possibility of having another household member or support person dispense the pills. In high-risk situations involving opioid use, also keep at least two doses of Narcan Nasal Spray, which is a highly effective rescue drug that lay people can administer. When used in time, Narcan can immediately reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Always lock up abuse-prone drugs such as prescription painkillers, anxiety medications, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Many inexpensive lock boxes can easily be broken into. A steel toolbox secured by a padlock is a safe, inexpensive option. For other necessary medications (both over-the-counter and prescription), only keep on hand limited quantities that would not constitute a serious danger if taken together. Lock up the rest. Advise families to ask their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what constitutes a safe quantity of medication to have in their home. The Poison Control Hotline at 800-222-1222 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) can also provide guidance on safe quantities. A family member or support person should seek this information, not the person at risk for suicide, since the information could be used to increase the lethality of an attempt. Use lower-toxicity rather than higher-toxicity medications, if possible, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant rather than a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant. Limit medication to quantities and combinations that, even if taken all at once, will not do serious harm. Consider requiring weekly refills to reduce lethality and increase contact.
Take into account the client's use of alcohol and other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. Some combinations are more deadly than others. If you have a client with a prescription for psychiatric medications, choose your words carefully so that you don’t send mixed messages or inadvertently inform the person about the lethality of the medications. If a client’s suicidal thoughts focus on methods other than guns or medications, incorporate those methods into your lethal means counseling. For example, if ideation focuses on filling the garage with car exhaust or crashing the car into a telephone pole, and the client has strong suicidal feelings, discuss ways to limit access to the car, such as having a family member hold onto the car keys temporarily.
What if ideation focuses on a certain method? There are times when a client’s ideation focuses on a very specific method that serves as their escape plan and may also have personally significant meaning. For example, your client carries around a belt that he could use to hang himself like his uncle did. If ideation focuses in this very specific way on one particular item, work with the client on agreeing to give up that item for now, while identifying strategies for staying alive. What about methods that cannot easily be restricted at home? Sometimes a client’s ideation focuses on suffocation or other highly lethal methods that are nearly impossible to control access to. These clients may need close supervision from family, friends, or others to ensure they don’t attempt suicide, particularly if their suicidality is of a more chronic or recurring nature. The client may opt to stay in a hospital if they feel the supervision would be helpful. Just One Part of a Safety Plan: In all cases, reducing access to lethal means should be part of a broader collaborative safety plan aimed at helping a client learn how to cope with suicidal feelings, as well as part of a broader therapeutic plan aimed at reducing the reasons for dying and increasing the reasons to live. To reduce access to firearms, the safest option is to store them away from the home. Possible storage options include with a relative or friend; with law enforcement; in a self-storage rental unit; or at a gun shop, shooting range, or pawn shop.
To reduce access to firearms that are stored in the home, use triple safety measures: Lock all firearms (or disassemble guns and lock a critical component), unload all firearms, and lock ammunition separately (or don’t keep ammunition at home for now).
Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
Guns that are kept at home for self-defense must be addressed since they are usually the ones that are most accessible. To reduce access to medications, remove unneeded medications from the home; keep only non-lethal quantities on hand; and lock up abuse-prone drugs, such as prescription painkillers, anxiety pills, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Discuss ways to reduce access to any method a client mentions using. Since escalation to a suicidal crisis can happen rapidly, the goal is to make the home safer for clients at risk before they are actively suicidal. Counseling on access to lethal means is for three types of clients:
Clients who have recently had suicidal thoughts.
Clients who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress. Clients who are struggling with a difficult mental health or substance abuse issue, particularly when they are also coping with a life crisis, such as relationship breakup, housing dislocation, arrest, or financial or job problems. These clients may not be currently suicidal but could become suicidal quickly. Routinely discus ways to reduce access to firearms and medications routinely with any client at risk of suicide. In addition, discuss any other method that a client with suicidal ideation considers using. Lethal means counseling is a client-centered intervention, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Your approach and the language you use are important to making this conversation effective, whether speaking to your client or to their friends and family members. Have a collaborative conversation and work together. With this approach, the client is the expert and the clinician is a resource. Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis as well as the need to reduce access to lethal means. Make specific and feasible plans. Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences. A guiding approach that is collaborative and client-centered is usually best, such as that used in motivational interviewing. Seek input from the client about their own reasons for - and against - reducing access, their own safety concerns, and what they would be willing to do. A collaborative approach accepts the client's values and works from the client's own motivations. "I can see how hard this has been for you lately, and I'm concerned about you. Are you concerned too?"
"What ideas do you have about ways to increase your safety in case you experience suicidal thoughts?" If your client is a gun owner: "Lots of people have guns at home. Some will store their guns outside of their home temporarily - such as at a relative's house or a gun shop - until they are feeling better. What do you think about a strategy like that?" A directive approach has a less collaborative tone and puts the clinician in the role of the expert. With certain clients, this approach may be more appropriate, for example: Clients who are too overwhelmed or stressed to make clear-headed decisions. Clients from certain cultures who may feel more comfortable getting advice rather than being asked for their ideas. Examples of Directive Statements: "I'm going to recommend that for now you store your guns away from home. Is that something you can do?"
"You'd be safer if you stored your guns away from home for now."
"I'm going to suggest you use this gun lock and have your wife keep the key."
"It would be best if you kept only a week's supply of medications at home and had a family member store the rest."
"For now, let's have your partner store your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in a lock box." No Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts: Some clients may disclose that they are suffering but say they are not suicidal. This may well be true for some clients; however, others may in fact be suicidal or likely to become so. If the client is having a very difficult time, and especially if life stressors are also present (e.g., custody battle, painful breakup, upcoming prison sentence, housing dislocation, work troubles), engage them in a conversation about reducing access to firearms and medications in case suicidal feelings develop.
Examples of how to respond to clients who say they are not suicidal: "I'm glad you're not feeling suicidal right now. Sometimes people who are struggling may have a crisis and suddenly experience strong suicidal feelings. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but if it does, I want to be sure you make it through safely and get the help you need. Can we talk over a plan, just in case?" When clients you suspect are suicidal don't disclose: "It's not unusual for people who have experienced the kind of pain you are going through recently to feel like it will last forever and to think they would rather be dead. Can we talk over a plan for how you'd stay safe if you started feeling suicidal?" Some clients, even if they are suicidal, may express resistance to reducing access to lethal means, like firearms. If clients or family members seem resistant, listen to what they say and work collaboratively toward solutions that address their concerns. For instance, some gun owners find the idea of living without a firearm in the home, even temporarily, very difficult. Don’t minimize that this may be a difficult decision. Examples on how to respond to clients who are in denial or resistant: When clients won't tell you whether they have a gun: Will you tell me what you’re worried would happen if you say you have a gun? I may be able to ease those worries. When clients think you are trying to take their gun away: "I am not questioning your right to own guns. Since you’ve talked about feeling suicidal, I’m concerned about helping you stay safe. Have you also been concerned?” When clients are concerned about what will go in their record: “Before we talk about your specific situation, I can let you know what sort of information I will write down and what I can omit.” When a client is concerned about chronic pain: “I hear that you are concerned you won’t have access to your medications during a flare-up. Let’s come up with a plan that supports both your health and safety.” When a family member is resistant to safely storing medications at home: “While it is true your child could get pills from a store, most suicide attempts occur at home with little or no preparation. Let’s talk about a plan that addresses your concerns and also ensures your daughter cannot take enough pills to harm herself.” Conversations about reducing access to lethal means are not always straightforward or easy. This can be especially true when discussing firearms. As a clinician, if you own guns you may feel more at ease raising the topic and more knowledgeable about storage options. If you aren’t a gun owner, it’s possible you might feel uneasy broaching the topic or overestimate client resistance. However, most gun owners value firearm safety and protecting their family—values that dovetail well with preventing suicide. When firearms are a family tradition and bonding experience: Consider alternatives
Discuss safety
Store guns elsewhere When guns provide safety and protection: Weigh concerns: Weigh the safety concerns of suicidality versus the concern of temporarily not having a firearm at home. Consider other options: Consider other things that could help keep the family safe such as pepper spray, alarms, or outdoor motion-detector lighting. Prioritize client's health: Underscore that part of protecting the client's family is ensuring the client is alive and well. Discuss behavioral history: Ask about any history of impulsive or unexpected behavior, and build on that to reinforce your concern. When guns provide security due to PTSD: Ask how client feels: Ask if the client trusts themselves with a loaded gun close at hand. Consider behavioral strategies: Use a behavioral intervention (e.g. behavioral modification, behavior shaping, rehearsal) or other interventions that focus on taking small steps to reduce access and gradually increasing these steps. Talking to Parents/Guardians: When working with a person under age 18 who is at risk for suicide, involve parents or guardians. Let them know that you are concerned about a possible suicide attempt and explain that reducing access to lethal means can reduce the likelihood of a suicide death.
When the youth has expressed suicidal ideation: “The fact that your child has had suicidal thoughts means we need to take the risk of suicide seriously. We’ve talked about getting him into treatment. I’d also like to talk about steps you can take at home to help keep him safe.”
"If a child or teenager attempts suicide, it’s usually at home and it’s often a quick decision. Putting time and distance between them and a method that could do serious harm is one of the single most effective steps to protect your child." When the youth is not currently suicidal but at risk: “I’ve asked her about suicidal thoughts, and she hasn’t disclosed any. Suicide is still a concern when kids are struggling. These thoughts can develop rapidly, often without warning, and can prompt an unplanned suicide attempt. Therefore, we routinely suggest a few important steps you can take at home.”
"With everything going on in your home right now and the impact on your child, it is best to make the environment in your home safer in case a suicidal crisis occurs unexpectedly. It is safest to temporarily remove all firearms from the home and to reduce access to medications, particularly those for pain and other drugs of abuse, while your child is at risk." Since firearms are the leading cause of suicide deaths, be sure to talk with the youth and their parents/guardians about guns in the home. Gather information from youth: Talk to your young clients about whether there are guns in the home and find out if they have access to them.&nbsp;For example, some clinicians ask youth, “How long would it take you to get access to guns in your home?”
Talk to the parents about gun access and storage:
Speak to the adult in the household who is the primary gun owner (unless there are contraindications such as spouse abuse).&nbsp; Find out the following: How are the guns stored in the home? Since gun owners often have more than one, gather information about all of them.
Does their child have access to any of the guns in the home? Many parents underestimate their children’s knowledge about where guns are stored and how to access them (e.g., key or combination).&nbsp;
Are there other homes where the youth stays that may have guns? Discuss all possibilities, such as joint custody situations, relatives, hunting buddies, or other friends.
Make sure the youth cannot hear your discussion (even if it is by phone), especially if there’s a chance the child is unaware of household firearms. Explain the focus on firearms, if necessary: If parents ask why you are focusing on firearms, explain that they are the most lethal method of suicide and that unlike nearly every other method, there’s no opportunity for the person to change their mind or be rescued mid-attempt. Since suicidal feelings are often short-lived and can come on unpredictably, putting time and distance between an at-risk youth and firearms is an effective way to protect them. Lethal means counseling is client-oriented. When discussing lethal means with clients or family members, make it a collaborative conversation. Your approach and the language you use matters. A collaborative, guiding approach is usually best. A more directive approach is less collaborative but may be more appropriate with certain clients. When working with a young person at risk for suicide, always involve parents or guardians. Together with your client, collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means. Depending on the client’s situation, this plan usually covers firearms and medications, as well as any other methods that are the focus of your client’s ideation.
The plan should include the following: Clear roles and tasks: Who will do what (this is especially important to do if others are involved) A timetable: When each part of the plan will be done Family members may not be aware that suicide attempts usually occur with little or no planning and that the method a person chooses often depends on its availability. It can be helpful to inform family members or significant others and to enlist their support in reducing access to lethal means, for example, if there are medications which the client must access daily or occasionally. Benefits: Involving family can be very effective. In fact, families counseled to remove or secure lethal means are far more likely to do so than those who are not counseled. Additionally, results of a pilot study indicate the majority of families reported that the counseling they received was respectful of their needs. Considerations: Some clients will not want you to enlist the help of their family members. In these situations, close friends or peer mentors may be more acceptable and less risky to involve than family members. Collaborate with your client on who would be best to engage.
- Permission:
- Ask your client for permission to talk with others before doing so (e.g., spouse, romantic partner, parents, friends, or peer mentors). For minors (under age 18), you may talk to the parents or legal guardian without the client’s permission. To help maintain your relationship with a minor, however, be sure to inform your client before speaking with a parent or guardian.
- Permission Denied:
- If a client does not give you permission to talk with anyone, yet you believe that removal of a lethal means is necessary for the safety of that individual, this could be considered permissible communication. Consult the current HIPAA guidelines for situations like this.
- Remember, in order to collaborate effectively with a client (or their parents), the clinician should:
- Use language that indicates acceptance of gun ownership without judgement.
- Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis and the need to reduce access to lethal means.
- Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences, recognizing that gun owners tend to prefer language that emphasizes options and autonomy. Consider the Client's Reaction: Before finalizing a plan to reduce access to firearms, or any suicide method, consider your client's reactions to it and the likelihood of follow-through with the plan. If you are working with the parents or guardians of youth, take their reactions into consideration. The client’s (or parents’) response may reveal whether the plan is likely to be carried out. Examples: Initial reluctance from client: Is your client initially reluctant to implement the plan and then relieved when they agree? This may indicate strong commitment to that particular method and a positive indication that, for now at least, they are electing to live. Readily agreeable client: If your client readily agrees to give up access to means and puts up no resistance, you may need to be a little suspicious. Sometimes lack of resistance means that the person is already considering a substitute method or holding something back. For example, the client may be thinking, “Okay, now that I don’t have guns, I’ll just use pills.” If you have doubts, say something like, “Thank you for your help on this. Now I’m wondering what other means you’ve considered and if those means are available to you.” Mixed messages from family members: If you are working with family members and one member is agreeable but the gun-owning family member seems reluctant, this may indicate a lack of commitment by the gun owner to follow through with the plan. Monitor Progress: Document and Monitor: Once you've arrived at a mutually acceptable plan for reducing access to lethal means, document it in your notes. Access to lethal means: For all persons identified at risk for suicide, indicate that you have assessed for specific access to lethal means. Recommendations and Steps: List any recommendations and steps agreed upon with the client to reduce access to lethal means and make the environment safer. Contact with Others: Indicate if you contacted family members or a support person to confirm the removal or securing of lethal means. If the client or family has engaged law enforcement, a pharmacy, or others to hold or dispose of lethal means, this should be documented in the medical records. One way to ensure that lethal means counseling becomes a standard component of working with people at risk of suicide is, where possible, to build prompts into electronic templates and paper forms that serve as a reminder. For example, systems that use electronic medical records can embed specific lethal means documentation into templates for intake assessments, crisis appointments, therapy or medication appointments, and many other appointment types. Recommendations for Follow-Up: Never assume that the agreed-on plan will go as intended. Follow-up is essential. Suggestions for monitoring progress: Make follow-up calls Call to check on progress and assess how the client is doing. Or ask the client or family member to contact you when they've carried out the tasks in the plan. Continue to assess suicide risk: Assess and monitor your client's risk of suicide on an ongoing basis. Things can improve or deteriorate rapidly. Return to discussions of means reduction as needed. Adapt plan Make any necessary changes to the plan if the client's situation changes. For instance, if a client moves out of their current home and in with a friend, the plan would need to be updated for the new living situation, and the friend would need to be collaboratively engaged in the plan. Encourage close supervision Encourage family, relatives, and friends to provide closer supervision since clients may struggle with their moods or have episodes of suicidal thoughts interspersed with stretches of feeling okay. Key Points: Collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means and enlist the support of family and friends. Agree on roles and timetable.
Document the plan in your notes and monitor progress. Continue to monitor the client's suicide risk as treatment continues. Update the plan to reduce means, as needed.

Questions for both: What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?
Can you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?
What role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?
Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy? Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first): Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. (Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)
Ask them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement. Now work with the leaning-in partner: Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. Summary statement: Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?
What do you think the problem is now?
How will you know when the problem is solved?
How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today? So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen? What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?
What changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? How have you managed to cope, ensure, keep going? What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?
On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope? Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. How were you hoping I could help you?
Asking for clients' perceptions
Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
How would you prefer things to be? What name would you give the problem?
What is it like to experience the problem?
What effect does the problem have on your life?
What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
Is this conversation useful? How is it useful? Who is in charge, the person or the problem? Reading between the lines of the problem story
Can you remember a time... What does it say about you... If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?
What 'starves' the problem?
Who benefits from the problem?
In what settings might the problem be useful?
Who advocates for the problem?
What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
Is the problem always with you? What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
What stood out for them?
What images it brought forward?
How it resonated with their own experiences?
Where they were transported by the interview?
Situate their reflections in their own experience
Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict... ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/questions-for-clients.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Questions for Clients.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:13:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Preparing for Co-Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Before each session co-therapists should have a pre-session meeting. Therapists pre-session so that co-therapists are on the same page. During pre-sessioning you should decide on the following: The intention or goals for the session
Agreement on a theoretical model
Create a session specific game plan
Discuss previous sessions, hypotheses, and evaluation of progress
Make decisions about next steps in treatment You should also consider the following questions amongst yourself: What would blow you out of the water?
What would be so shocking that you wouldn't know what to do?
Let's brainstorm what we would do if XYZ occurred in session Examples (arguing, escalation, high conflict, desire to end relationship, risk, etc.) How would you manage that?
What do you anticipate?
What is your theory of what's going on--your theory of the problem? Strategies for the therapy room As a co-therapy team you should determine which strategies you are going to use in the room. What is the role of each therapist and how will you work together. Some strategies to consider: Tag team One starts speaking, while the other would be writing questions, and perhaps nodding occasionally, or making validating and summarizing statements.
Then, when number one (i.e. the one who was speaking) runs out number two is ready. They're ready, because they've been writing questions, and they can jump in with those questions. Preparation and sharing airtime Who will do what in the session? Who is handling assessment or genogram?
Will we ever spend time one on one or break up subsystems of the client system?
Split the joining tasks
Before you go into the room, you decide which member of the couple each therapist will focus on with joining. For example: You're going to join with the husband, and I'm going to join with the wife.
It's very specific who we're each validating, empathizing, and summarizing. If you start asking questions of the husband, it's my job to ask the follow-up questions of the wife. In the same vein with the wife, so that we're like two advocates. Reflecting Team As co-therapists there may be times when you find it appropriate to turn to one another and talk about what is going on or what you notice in the room. This could be used as an intervention or to help determine the next steps in the session.
Example: Co-therapists turn to one another and debate or argue about what is happening with the client system. Have a discussion or debate about what is going on, and then turn back to the couple and say, "Where are we going wrong?, or "How are we getting it right?" ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Preparing for Co-Therapy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:13:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ECR-SF Scoring]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Results consist of two scores for the two separate factors; Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. The minimum score for each scale is 7 and a maximum score of 42. In addition, scores are represented in terms of percentile ranks compared to a normative sample. A percentile of 50 represents typical (and healthy) attachment, whereas higher percentiles represent more difficulties with adult attachment compared to peers.
Attachment avoidance is defined as involving fear of dependence and interpersonal intimacy, an excessive need for self-reliance, and reluctance to self-disclose.
Attachment anxiety is defined as involving a fear of interpersonal rejection or abandonment, an excessive need for approval from others, and distress when one’s partner is unavailable or unresponsive.
People who score high on either or both of these dimensions are assumed to have an insecure adult attachment orientation. By contrast, people with low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance can be viewed as having a secure adult attachment orientation (Brennan et al., 1998). In addition, higher scores are significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, interpersonal distress, or loneliness.

Why are couples behaving so badly? "The average couple waits 6 years before seeking out therapy." (Gottman) In those 6 years there is: Build up of resentments
Reinforced bad habits
No boundary enforcement
Erosion of positive perspective
Unconscious bias kicks - assumptions about purposeful poor behavior choices
Missed bids for attention
Depletion of emotional bank account
Never had any positive role models to begin with From a survey conducted in September 2020: Increases in substance misuse: Alcohol (88%)
Marijuana (37%)
Prescription Opioids (15%) Domestic violence cases increased by 25%-33% globally. How are these influences showing up in the clients in the therapy room? Passive/aggressive behaviors
Shut down/Withdrawn/Stonewalling
Withholding Sex or Avoiding Intimacy
Narcissistic Behavior Responses
Gaslighting
Anger
High Conflict
Boundary Crossing
Persistent and Ongoing Flooding
Unwilling to Repair/Apologize/Take Responsibility How to prepare yourself for the unexpected: When you open your office door, look for body language and non-verbals. Have confidence and KNOW that you are the expert in the room. Own it and be brave. Set the tone at the beginning of the session when you feel something is off. Let the clients know what you feel when you feel it, and be willing to talk about what is happening. (Do not wait for clients to bring it up or ignore it)
Model for your couples that you are going to talk about it, not let things be passive-aggressive or avoid dealing with hot topics. Remind clients who escalate that they are not in therapy to repeat old patterns. Pause and interrupt when you see unacknowledged emotion happening in the room. That is your job. Don't let your couples argue or verbally explode on each other. They can do that at home for free. Take Control. Develop your phrase to create stop-action with clients. Say things like, 'pause, stop,' or call out your client's name, etc. Be direct. What is acceptable and what is not acceptable about words or behavior in the room. What you would like your clients to do instead (as for their positive need). Why it's not okay for them to say or do the thing that you witnessed in the room. Let the clients know how painful it is for you to witness, so you can't imagine what it's like for their partner. Keep your eyes on each client in the room. Are you letting one partner high jack the session? Stop the speaking partner and ask, 'What's coming up for you?' Notice if the other partner checks in. Be mindful of the need to stop and tend to the party not speaking. This is how you keep explosions from getting out of control because you have been checking in on what is happening on the other side of the couch. Step in for clients when they don't have words and find a way to speak their pain to their partner. Keep it fair, so both partners feel you are connected with their pain, needs, and wanted outcomes. Normalize high emotion and disappointment of partner not being able to acknowledge perspectives not because they don't love you. Differences on family of origin, difference in expectations, etc. Prior traumas and life experiences make it hard for partners to always regulate their emotions in ways they would hope. Untreated mental health issues impact ability to manage emotions. Not finished working on the 'Me' stuff versus the 'We' stuff and bleeding over into our relationship. Discuss the impact of substances and the impact it has on being able to manage emotions. Gottman Method: Flooding is expected because partners are experiencing physiological arousal. Utilize pulse oximeters to help validate their elevated heart rate. Be okay with breaking it up. Sometimes you need to have one couple leave the room while you do some one-on-one with the other partner. Let an explosive partner leave if they want. Don't chase them or try to convince them to stay or come back. Talk about the flooding in the room and share ways to help self-regulate, like taking deep breaths or pausing to find ways to reframe. You need to be prepared when working with couples that you might need to a break from couples therapy or stop all together based on how the clients present. This is your call as a therapist to evaluate if working with the couple is contraindicated because of co-occurring mental health, substance, unresolved trauma, suicidal ideation, personality disorders, characterological DV, or anger management issues. Often necessary to request that clients seek out individual therapy to strengthen their individual coping skills before attempting additional couples' therapy. Expect your clients to disagree and give you pushback. Attitude is everything in this conversation. Remember, your clients are not your peers, and we often have to make unpopular decisions about the course of care. When you feel anxious and flooded as the therapist: Notice where you are breathing. Plant both feet on the floor. Take your shoulders back against your chair, take a deep breath into your belly, and repeat to yourself: "This is not my pain to feel." Get in touch with your client's inner 5-year-old old in the room. What is hurting them, and what is the catastrophe scenario that is playing out for them?
When I de-escalate, so do my clients. When my voice gets softer and quieter, so does my clients, and they can often match my tone and calm demeanor. Don't shy away from acknowledging they have the right to feel upset, and it makes sense they would be even if their partner does not agree. Ask their partner to find something they said that they can validate for their partner. Remind them this is not the same as agreeing. Focus on the behavior or the words you heard. We can help facilitate meaningful conversation about the emotions each partner is feeling. Ask the partner who is feeling a big emotion related to their partner to name their emotion. Then talk the behavior they say their partner do or the words they heard them say. Remind and monitor clients to avoid telling their partner their evaluation of why their partner did it or the mind set they were in when it happened. This often happens and only creates defensiveness in their partner. No one likes to be told how they feel. Ask for your positive need. Even if the answer is no - you need to hear yourself asking for your need. Gottman Method Stress Reducing Conversation 10-minutes each partner. Listening for understanding and share emotion. (Not problem-solving)
How do clients know it's working? Does your partner feel hear and understood? Then yes. Use of open-ended questions to help partners attune, connect, and provide empathy and support. Questions that allow for each partner to draw out their partner's experience, such as: "What is this like for you? What do you need? What don't you like about this situation?" Gottman Method Dreams within Conflict Asks clients to suspend problem-solving so they can have a better understanding of the childhood stories, values, or core ethics and beliefs that keep their partner rooted in their perspective. Clients take turns asking each partner a set of questions so they can better experience what it's like to walk in their partner's shoes. Preparation for compromise like partners who love each other. Gottman Method Injuries Exercise Helps partners find a structured and safe format to talk about old injuries in a way that helps facilitate compassion, acceptance, and understand about prior and shared traumas.
Creates awareness and insight about the impact and ways these traumas have shaped the way each partner views their world.
Helps evaluate how clients have learned to cope and survive. Can help some clients gain insight on how they behave in relationships in ways that no longer serve them.
Helps couples therapist normalize and make recommendations of ways those old injuries get triggered in the relationship and behavior changes that might be beneficial. Gottman Method Appreciations Exercise Changes tone and energy in session.
Allows each partner to find something positive to notice about their partner to demonstrate holding each other from a positive perspective.
Makes deposits into each partner’s emotional bank account.
Starts conversations about how to do small things often in the relationship for highly disconnected couples.
Way to end session, so couples can ground before leaving in turmoil. If apologies are made, they are often expressed as implying you misunderstood something but without remorse for poor behaviors
Outside behaviors or the other person is ALWAYS the source of conflict or turn it around on the other person implying they are really the culprit for the issue
Self-doubt creeps in and the partner being gaslit internalizes their lack of hard work in the relationship as the cause of all the problems.
Guilt develops about bringing up issues in the relationship.
It feels very much like the result of narcissistic behavior responses.
The partner who is doing the gaslighting may do so unconsciously to gain control or power in the relationship when they feel out of resources or support.
Manipulation that involves making someone question their own reality, feelings, and experiences of events, in order to maintain CONTROL over that person. Deflecting the other person by use of lack of acknowledgement, negative body language, and minimizing statements about the other person’s perspective or feelings. Unwillingness to accept any part of the responsibility for a misunderstanding or conflict. Intentional implication that the other person is over-reacting or has fabricated a situation in order to create doubt or challenge the other person’s reality Being cut off from making points, asking questions, or providing input during a disagreement. No acknowledgment of your hurt feelings when expressed. Lacks Empathy.
Clients are often overly invested in using narcissist label with each other. Only 5% of population are diagnosable with narcissistic personality disorder
You should be aware that most clients who have diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder are not going to be served in couples therapy and may be contra-indicated. Gottman Interventions to Bring into Session Introduces the idea that anything our partner does for us is a gift - they are not required to do so because we are in a relationship with each other.
Softened Start Up: This is helpful for the narcissistic leaning partner to learn how to be clear in their needs and learn how to share why it is important to them. This helps them to slowly understand they are not entitled to anything. Appreciations: Help the narcissistic partner to think about what the other person adds to their life and to acknowledge it. Accept the things you can't change. Helpful for both partners to understand there are some things that are unlikely to ever completely be different in their dynamics. Helps partners make a choice about the relationship from that space of acceptance. Aftermath of a Regrettable Incident: Introduction to Narcissistic person about their role in feeling disrespected or unappreciated. Active listening exercises like the Gottman-Rapport You must interrupt patterns of rage, repeated interruptions, storming off, or screaming. Be on the lookout for a partner who has NPD to be overly charming or makes big declarations of victimhood, or says their only goal is “to fight for the relationship.” Avoid becoming a victim of triangulation or becoming caught up in buying into the hope that you can fix the narcissistic behaviors. You MUST be comfortable being direct, holding a strong position of authority in the room, and be willing to call out poor behavior that is impacting the relationship. Strongly suggest and sometimes require that both partners be in individual therapy and check in with this therapist to make sure they are aware of the dynamics happening in the relationship. The only goal you may accomplish is validating the victim that they are correct in their reality and that they can trust their intuition. You may serve as the objective voice this person needs to get clear and end the relationship. Don’t fight, argue, or try to overpower the narcissist.
There is a very strong likelihood that despite your support that these sessions may not go as you hope! Many clients who have narcissistic behaviors can and will use the tools they learn in session to abuse, further manipulate, or weaponize against their partner. True NPD will NOT be ok with the change in or loss of power and will retaliate. Evaluate if the partner is becoming more agitated, aggressive, and if you suspect there is an increased likelihood for physical abuse-stop sessions. Recognize you can and potentially should take a break from therapy with the couples. Should you refer them to seek individual therapy for a while and then re-evaluate if they are good candidates for couples therapy? Couples therapy can re-traumatize the partner who is being victimized. Consider if this is in the scope of your practice? Do you need to refer out? Make time before letting clients go to let them know that it was a hard session and how important it was to have it. Let your partner know that if they are flooded when they will come back and talk about it with you. Make a date with each other to come back and process. Check in with each partner about what they will do to self-soothe. Remind clients that emotions and feeling hurt or misunderstood happens in relationships. The couple is not in this situation because they don’t love each other but because the stakes are so high. This is your person and if we are not ok then nothing feels ok. Let them know you are proud of them for doing the work.

Increase understanding of the prevalence, characteristics and impact of trauma on individuals. Understand the neurobiology of trauma and how the stress response system impacts functioning. Identity and apply trauma-informed strategies for deescalating crisis situations and working with people who are emotionally distressed. An event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects. Abuse, neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, incarceration of family members, family substance abuse, sudden or expected loss of a loved one Exposure to war, political violence, torture, forced displacement, migration and acculturation stressors, fears of deportation Pain, injury and serious illness; invasive medical procedures or treatments Lack of resources, support networks, or mobility; financial stressors; homelessness Hurricanes, fires, floods Accidents, wars, environmental disasters, acts of terrorism Robberies, shootings, assault, gang-related violence, hate crimes, group trauma affecting a particular community Threats, fights, school shootings, bullying, loss of a student or staff member Exposure to multiple traumatic events from an early age.
The immediate and long-term effects of these experiences over development. "The cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations, including the lifespan, which emanates from massive group trauma." (Braveheart)
Examples: American Indian and Alaskan Native communities
Communities of color
Holocaust survivors
Japanese-American survivors of internment camps
LGBTQ communities Potentially traumatic experiences resulting from: Direct experiences of racial harassment
Witnessing racial violence toward others
Experiencing discrimination and institutional racism A single traumatic event that is limited in time Experiencing multiple traumatic events Exposure to chronic trauma which impacts the child's development Usually caused by adults entrusted with the child's care NORMAL response/reaction to stress and even trauma (4-6 weeks) Exaggerated and prolonged stress response beyond 4-6 weeks and even years later Dysregulation of stress chemistry - stress hormone levels don't decrease
Increased activation of Sympathetic Nervous System (heart rate, startle response, fight response) 70% of adults in the US have experienced some types of traumatic event at least once in their lives. 223.4 million people In public behavioral health, over 90% of clients have experienced trauma.
Trauma is a risk factor in nearly all behavioral health and substance use disorders. Collaboration between the CDC and Kaiser Permanente study of over 17,000 adult patients in health maintenance organizations (1995-1997); 2 waves of data collection
Gathers information about health history and exposure to the following events prior to age 18: Recurrent physical abuse
Recurrent emotional abuse
Sexual abuse
An alcohol or drug abuser
An incarcerated household member
Someone who is chronically depressed, suicidal, institutionalized or mentally ill
Mother being treated violently
One or no parents
Emotional or physical neglect “How ACEs influence health and wellbeing through lifespan.png” could not be found. Nearly two-thirds Ohioans have been exposed to ACEs
Ohioans more likely to experience multiple ACEs: People of color
People with low-income
People with a disability
Residents of urban and Appalachian counties Stress: Unpredictable, Severe, Prolonged -&gt; Vulnerability
Predictable, Moderate, Controlled -&gt; Resilience Natural response to the prolonged uncertainty and disruption caused by a pandemic Lack of motivation
Stress over tasks that would generally be managed well
Changes in eating or sleeping habits
Irritability
Feelings of hopelessness
Difficulty concentrating At any given point in time, we have a limited supply of 'adaptive energy'
In the best of conditions, this reservoir is quite high and will allow us to meet unusual challenges
Chronic and prolonged stress related to COVID-19 and other stressors has depleted the reservoir of adaptive energy, making us all more vulnerable to stress. The amygdala senses threat and sets off the alarm. Thinking brain assess the situation. Thinking brain goes offline. Emotional brain activates fight or flight response. Thinking brain helps shut off the alarm and helps us to calm down. An experience becomes traumatic when it overwhelms our system for responding to stress. The emotional brain continues to sound the alarm and send messages to fight or flee, even after the threat has passed. Autonomic Nervous System: Direct role in physical response to stress. Sympathetic Nervous System: 'Fight or flight' response
Body shifts energy resources toward fighting off or fleeing a threat
Signals release of adrenaline and cortisol
Heart beats faster, respiration rate increases, blood vessels in arms and legs dilate, digestive process changes, glucose levels in blood (sugar energy) increase Parasympathetic Nervous System: Facilitates recovery once acute stressor is over
Over-activity can contribute to stress reactions Chronic stress can result in a long-term drain on the body Wear and tear
Continuous activation of the nervous system can be problematic in all systems. Musculoskeletal System: Muscles in body are in constant state of guardedness Muscle tension, headaches, migraines, back pain Respiratory System Shortness of breath
Rapid breathing Cardiovascular System Elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, elevated stress hormones, inflammation Endocrine System Increased production of cortisol Gastrointestinal System Changes in gut bacteria, pain, bloating, discomfort Esophagus Eat more or less than usual, increased use of substances, heartburn/acid reflux History of previous exposure to trauma
Age of exposure Gender
Cognitive ability
Self-efficacy
Biological factors (e.g. flexibility in thinking, emotional regulation) Nature of the traumatic event
Proximity to the traumatic event
Culture and ethnicity
Level of social support
Quality of parent-child relationships, parent mental health, and parental history of trauma
Health of the broader community Positive: Resilience A positive, adaptive response to significant adversity. Adaptable, caring, and supportive relationship with an adult. A sense of mastery over life circumstances. Strong executive function and self-regulation skills.
Affirming faith or cultural traditions Individuals may demonstrate resilience in one type of situation but not another. Coping skills that support resilience can be developed at any age. Children do not develop the capacity to positive adapt to adversity in isolation. Regardless of resources, individuals who face extreme adversity are likely to be significantly impacted. We all play an important role in fostering resilience. Recovery
Post-traumatic growth Negative: Severe persisting distress
Decline
Stable maladaptive functioning We need to presume the clients we serve have a history of traumatic stress and exercise “universal precautions” by creating systems of care that are trauma-informed. Understanding trauma and its impact
Promoting safety
Ensuring cultural competence
Supporting control, choice, autonomy
Collaboration and mutuality
Integrating care
Healing happens in relationships
Recovery is possible Bringing a volatile and potentially explosive situation to a peaceful, calm resolution by verbal means... and no one getting hurt.
Key Components: Body language: Facial expression

Active listening Judgement/Bias/Fatigue/Distractions
Body language: Facial expression

Being in tune with your stress signals Do you have a good sense of how your body communicates when it is overwhelmed? Your PERCEPTION of your ability to effectively manage crisis situations. Body language
History of aggression/violence/belligerence
Self image
Life circumstances Legal issues, work stress, social support, financial situation Drug and alcohol use/abuse
Physical health
Mental functioning
Emotional health
Trauma exposure Affect person's perception of self, the world, and the future
Affect person's: Ability to trust others
Sense of personal safety
Effectiveness in navigating life's challenges Difficulty processing information
Short-term memory impairment
Perceptual field narrows Ability to regulate emotions effectively Feeling helpless and hopeless
A sense that one can never do enough
Hypervigilance
Diminished creativity
Inability to embrace complexity
Minimizing
Chronic exhaustion/physical ailments
Dissociative moments
Sense of persecution
Guilt
Fear
Anger and cynicism
Inability to emphasize/numbing
Addictions
Grandiosity: Inflated sense of importance Overcrowded?
Loud?
Overstimulating?
Other clients present? Kids present?
Other staff visible? Able to support/get help if needed?
Person kept waiting? Ignored?
Objects around that could be used for violence?
Open path to exit? Think and plan ahead Be familiar with agency policies/procedures
Develop plans for 'high risk' clients in advance Develop plans for common scenarios based on your role, department, program, etc. Monitor and manage your own stress level Clients in crisis require structure and boundaries to help re-establish stability
Engaging client in discussion (repeated concerns can inadvertently contribute to chaos and triangulation; following the identified plan is the best way to support and care for these clients)
Parallel Process: Don't get pulled into the chaos
Setting firm, clear boundaries creates safety and minimizes potential for triangulation and miscommunication Identifying single point of contact for clients help ensure we have clear, consistent communication and avoids potential for triangulation People are doing the best they can to get their needs met
Escalation is likely a learned behavior
Be PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE Attend to person before things escalate Stage 1: Anxiety/Agitation
Stage 2: Argumentative/Defensive
Stage 3: Verbally, Physically Threatening
Stage 4: Assaultive The more threatened the individual, the more 'primitive' (or regressed) becomes the style of thinking and behaving. When a traumatized person is in a state of alarm: They will be less capable of concentrating
They will be more anxious
They will pay more attention to non-verbal cues Tone of voice, body posture, and facial expressions Trigger: Any stimulus that acts as a reminder of past overwhelming experience Internal: Body sensations, emotions, etc. External: Sounds, sights, smells, facial expressions, etc. Common triggers: Unpredictability, sudden change, transitions
Loss of control
Feeling vulnerable
Feeling rejected
Confrontation
Loneliness
Sensory overload
Intimacy (safety, love, security, family)
Peace, calm, quiet 'Re-Experiencing' can lead to out-of-control behavior When someone with a trauma history begins to escalate, it may be because they are remembering or re-experiencing a traumatic event
They may be reminded of the trauma and be flooded or overwhelmed with memories of that earlier traumatic event. Remember your superpowers: Body language Facial expression
Posture
Position Tone of voice
Active listening Calm and caring attitude
Ask for help Someone who is escalated is under stress and not likely to think clearly
Your perception of your ability to cope with the situation is going to impact your own stress level when managing these interactions
De-escalation skills start with self-awareness. Understanding how stress affects how you act, think, and communicate Speak in a calm, slow, warm, clear voice
Show that you care
Be aware of your non-verbal communication
Acknowledge feelings
Maintain eye contact (but don't stare)
You may need to repeat yourself; the client may be distracted
Be patient; give the situation time; time is on your side
Remain a friendly tone and join with the client Helps the client see that you and the client are a team
"We are going to figure this out" Allow the client to vent ("Tell me more about that")
Use 'Please' and 'thank you' often
Accept the client's feelings, thoughts and behaviors without judgement Remember that most of us have been irrational and said inappropriate things when we are under extreme stress Effective communication often depends as much on how you say the words you choose as much as the words themselves
Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings
Alert others, if needed
Evaluate each situation for violence
Keep an open path
Remove yourself/others if situation is getting out of control Open up clear lines of communication
Build trust and validate the client's situation (even if you don't agree)
Get the client talking about concerns as a route to calming
Gather the necessary information to make a good resolution If a client is escalated, they feel out of control which tells us that their normal coping measures are not working
Keep your focus. You are trying to give the client a sense that they are in control. When someone feels out of control, they are more likely to escalate Your ability to engage a client in conversation successfully can resolve the conflict
If it seems you may not get there, ask for help Shows interest
Close-ended questions may be necessary but client is more likely to tell you what you want to hear
"What can I help you with today?" vs. "Do you want to schedule an appointment?"
"What time of day works best for you?" vs. "Can you come at 2 pm?"
"Can you tell me..." Being expressively/explicitly kind
Builds rapport and nurtures competence "I appreciate you telling me what's wrong."
"It took a lot of courage for you to reach out today."
"You've done a great job of keeping your appointments in the past. We really appreciate that." Validates and shows you’ve heard the client
Mirror back what you’re hearing is going on • Allow further explanation of the concern by not inserting your opinion
Listen for feelings, themes, motivations, unmet need “It sounds like you’ve had a really tough time.”
“You’re really angry about what’s happened.” “You’re ____.” Insert any emotion—“mad,” “upset,” “frustrated,” “worried,” etc. You can’t do it wrong! “Sounds like…”
“Seems like…”
“It feels like…”
“To you, it looks like…”
“I am hearing…”
“I am wondering if…” Help transition the client to resolution: “So you’ve been through a lot and you’re really upset about everything that’s happened before. It sounds like we need to get you in to talk to someone. Would it be okay to get you scheduled for an appointment?”
“The last time you were here, you thought you got the run around and didn’t have time to see the provider. You were really frustrated by all that. How about if we get you scheduled again and see if we can get things resolved?” Remember the overall goal - client care
If you take a LESS authoritative, LESS controlling, LESS confrontational approach, you actually will have MORE control in the situation. Responding angrily
Not listening
Criticizing
Being defensive
Arguing with the client
Engaging in power struggles
Ordering the client what to do Threatening (to cancel an appointment, etc.)
Minimizing the importance of the client's concern
Moving quickly (can be perceived as aggressive) Saying "You need to calm down"
Trying to be right
Giving commands "lower your voice" Arguing with the client
Taking the words or actions of the client personally (even if the client tries to make it personal)
Minimizing the situation ("It is not that bad")
Asking a lot of questions
Asking 'Why' questions
Forcing discussion Do not express anger, impatience, or irritation Breathe
Take a moment away, if possible Never use inflammatory language ("You are acting crazy")
Notice if you are feeling as though you have to rush or feeling like you are stuck if it takes time to get to work through the client interaction Breathe through it, be patient
Request help, if needed Don't intervene too quickly or try too hard to control the interaction by interrupting or talking over the client Follow agency policy Document Debrief Strategies to manage/avoid similar situations in future What went well? What didn't go well?
Did anything contribute to the escalation?
Did anything help diffuse the situation? Support for staff, clients, and individuals involved People are coping the best way they can - our job is to help them find a better way
Requires building trust, creating safety, and creating a trauma informed culture that provides a safe and healing environment
Healing takes more than therapy Support services can create therapeutic, healing experiences - a place of safety Screen for trauma history
Deepen attunement skills - learn to interpret behavior effectively as communication
Employ person-centered, strengths-based thinking and language
Provide stability and empowerment
Consider the physiological, psychological, and social risks of physical interventions - choose the least restrictive option as a last resort if somebody is a danger to themselves or others
Prioritize debriefing after a crisis to help foster resilience and develop successful coping skills Be empathetic and non-judgemental
Respect personal space
Use non-threatening non-verbals
Avoid overreacting
Focus on feelings
Ignore challenging questions
Set limits
Choose wisely what you insist upon
Allow silence for reflection
Allow time for decisions

History and Ethical Principles: Introduction: The foundation of the federal regulations that govern the protection of human subjects in research can be found, in large part, in the ethical principles detailed in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>Belmont Report
The ethical principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. <br><a data-href="Respect for Persons" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/respect-for-persons" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Respect for Persons</a>:Respect for Persons
This principle includes two requirements: Acknowledge and treat individuals as autonomous. Protect those with limited autonomy. <br><a data-href="Beneficence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/beneficence" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Beneficence</a>:Beneficence
Two general rules reflect this principle: Do no harm. Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. <br><a data-href="Justice" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/justice" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice</a>:Justice
This principle requires researchers to: Treat people fairly. Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>. . Informed Consent: People have the right to expect that researchers will treat them as autonomous individuals, respecting their decisions about whether to take part in research and about what personal information they will or will not share with others. This is accomplished through a thorough informed consent process that is presented in a language understandable to the research subject. The Consent Process: The federal regulations about informed consent list elements of information that the researcher must provide to subjects. The regulations divide the elements into two categories. One category includes basic elements to be provided to all subjects. The second set includes elements that must be provided, when appropriate. Consent should begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a subject in understanding the research, what is expected of them, and the potential risks of harm and benefits. Regulations require that this information be understandable to the subject and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. The emphasis on subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) comprehension and presenting information that a 'reasonable person' would want to have in order to make an informed decision to participate, and providing an opportunity to discuss. This 'key information' is not defined in the regulation, but examples of key information were provided in the preamble to the revised Common Rule: The fact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary. The purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective subject's participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research.

It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness in non-global-directed activity).
Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition. Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndrome level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis. Note: Criteria 1-4 constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&nbsp;is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through adolescence and into adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity (over-activity). Based on data from the NSCH, the median age for onset for children with current ADHD was 6 years. More severe cases of ADHD in children, as described by parents, were diagnosed earlier. The median age of diagnosis for severe ADHD was 4 years. The median age of diagnosis for moderate ADHD was 6 years.
The median age of diagnosis for mild ADHD was 7 years. Approximately one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. Medication can be used to effectively treat ADHD symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity, and is the single most effective treatment for reducing ADHD symptoms.
Figure 2 is based on data from the NSCH and shows medication use among children with ADHD in 2011. An estimated 69.3% of children with a current diagnosis of ADHD received medication for ADHD.
Medication use increased 4% overall from 2007 to 2011, particularly among male teens.

Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts in mood and energy levels are more severe than the normal ups and downs that are experienced by everyone. Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older. An estimated 2.8% of U.S. adults had bipolar disorder in the past year.
Past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among adults was similar for males (2.9%) and females (2.8%). An estimated 4.4% of U.S. adults experience bipolar disorder at some time in their lives.

The signs and symptoms of SAD include those associated with depression as well as disorder-specific symptoms that differ for winter-pattern versus summer-pattern SAD.
Symptoms of depression can include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks
Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
Feelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
Decreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
Changes in sleep or appetite or unplanned weight changes
Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment
Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts For winter-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Oversleeping (hypersomnia)
Overeating, particularly with a craving for carbohydrates, leading to weight gain
Social withdrawal (feeling like “hibernating”) For summer-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
Poor appetite, leading to weight loss
Restlessness and agitation
Anxiety
Violent or aggressive behavior Winter-pattern SAD should not be confused with “holiday blues”—feelings of sadness or anxiety brought on by stresses at certain times of the year. The depression associated with SAD is related to changes in daylight hours, not the calendar, so stresses associated with the holidays or predictable seasonal changes in work or school schedules, family visits, and so forth are not the same as SAD. To be diagnosed with SAD, a person must meet the following criteria: They have the symptoms of depression or the more specific symptoms of winter- or summer-pattern SAD listed above.
Their depressive episodes occur during specific seasons (winter or summer) for at least 2 consecutive years. However, not all people with SAD experience symptoms every year.
Their depressive episodes during the specific season are more frequent than depressive episodes experienced at other times of the year. It is estimated that millions of Americans experience SAD, although many may not know they have this common disorder. In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.
SAD occurs much more often in women than in men. Winter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-pattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people living farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in the winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England are more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida.
SAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves repeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes (less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I disorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other mental disorders, such as <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Eating Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eating Disorders</a>, <a data-href="Anxiety Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety Disorders</a>, or <a data-href="Panic Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Panic Disorder</a>. <br>SAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common in people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, such as <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. Researchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most research to date has investigated potential causes of winter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier to study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern SAD, and more research is needed.
Studies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-pattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also suggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help maintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may prevent these molecules from functioning properly, contributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.
Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in people with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is believed to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin D consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the winter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, further reducing serotonin activity.
Other studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to altered levels of melatonin—a hormone important for maintaining the normal sleep−wake cycle. People with winter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can increase sleepiness and lead to oversleeping.
In contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have reduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days worsening sleep quality and leading to depression symptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high temperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, these theories have not been systematically tested.
Both serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body’s daily rhythm tied to the seasonal night−day cycle. In people with SAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal daily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to seasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and behavior changes.
Negative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer and its associated limitations and stresses are also common among people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, however, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the mood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment. Treatments are available to help people with SAD. They fall into four main categories that can be used alone or in combination: Light therapy
Psychotherapy
Antidepressant medication
Vitamin D Light therapy and vitamin D are treatments for winter-pattern SAD, whereas psychotherapy and antidepressants are used to treat depression in general, including winter- and summer-pattern SAD. There are no treatments specific to summer-pattern SAD. Since the 1980s, light therapy has been a mainstay for treating winter-pattern SAD. It aims to expose people with SAD to a bright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in darker months.
For this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright light box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30−45 minutes, usually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light box, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor light, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making this a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain eye diseases or people taking certain medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative treatments or use light therapy under medical supervision. Psychotherapy can help people with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that contribute to depression.
<br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a type of psychotherapy aimed at helping people learn to challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive and anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with SAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in two weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing negative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts about the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with more positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called behavioral activation, which helps people identify and schedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to offset the loss of interest they typically experience in the winter or summer.
When researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light therapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving SAD symptoms—although some symptoms got better slightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a long-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters found that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer. Medications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can be effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with talk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress.&nbsp;
Antidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work. Problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may need to try several medications to find the one that works best.
Because SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with disturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly enhance a person’s mood.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release form designed to last longer in the body. For many people, bupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive episodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring. Because many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. However, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD have produced mixed results, with some studies indicating that it is as effective as light therapy and other studies finding no effect. Because the onset of SAD is so predictable, people with a history of the disorder might benefit from starting the treatments mentioned above before the fall (for winter-pattern SAD) or spring (for summer-pattern SAD) to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms. To date, few studies have investigated whether SAD can be prevented.

Perinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. In rare cases, the symptoms are severe enough that the health of the mother and baby may be at risk. Perinatal depression can be treated. This brochure describes the signs and symptoms of perinatal depression and how you or a loved one can get help. Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The word “perinatal” refers to the time before and after the birth of a child. Perinatal depression includes depression that begins during pregnancy (called prenatal depression) and depression that begins after the baby is born (called postpartum depression). Mothers with perinatal depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that may make it difficult for them to carry out daily tasks, including caring for themselves or others. The “baby blues” is a term used to describe mild mood changes and feelings of worry, unhappiness, and exhaustion that many women sometimes experience in the first 2 weeks after having a baby. Babies require around-the-clock care, so it’s normal for mothers to feel tired or overwhelmed sometimes. If mood changes and feelings of anxiety or unhappiness are severe, or if they last longer than 2 weeks, a woman may have postpartum depression. Women with postpartum depression generally will not feel better unless they receive treatment. Perinatal depression is a real medical illness and can affect any mother—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Women are not to blame or at fault for having perinatal depression: it is not brought on by anything a mother has or has not done. Perinatal depression does not have a single cause. Research suggests that perinatal depression is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Life stress (for example, demands at work or experiences of past trauma), the physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby, and changes in hormones that occur during and after pregnancy can contribute to the development of perinatal depression. In addition, women are at greater risk for developing perinatal depression if they have a personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder or if they have experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mental illness that occurs after childbirth. PP is a medical emergency, and it is important to seek help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Women who have PP can have delusions (thoughts or beliefs that are not true), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling things that are not there), mania (a high, elated mood that often seems out of touch with reality), paranoia, and confusion. Women who have PP also may be at risk for harming themselves or their child and should receive help as soon as possible. Recovery is possible with professional help. Some women may experience a few symptoms of perinatal depression; others may experience several symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of perinatal depression include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
Irritability
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
Fatigue or abnormal decrease in energy
Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
Difficulty sleeping (even when the baby is sleeping), awakening early in the morning, or oversleeping
Abnormal appetite, weight changes, or both
Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause or do not ease even with treatment
Trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with the new baby
Persistent doubts about the ability to care for the new baby
Thoughts about death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby Treatment for perinatal depression is important for the health of both the mother and the baby, as perinatal depression can have serious health effects on both. With proper treatment, most women feel better and their symptoms improve.
Treatment for perinatal depression often includes therapy, medications, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may be an option to explore. Several types of psychotherapy can help women with perinatal depression. Two examples of evidence-based approaches that have been used to treat perinatal depression include <a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> and interpersonal therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help people with depression and anxiety. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations. People learn to challenge and change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior as a way of improving their depressive and anxious feelings and emotions. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar concerns. IPT is an evidence-based therapy that has been used to treat depression, including perinatal depression. It is based on the idea that interpersonal and life events impact mood and vice versa. The goal of IPT is to help people to improve their communication skills within relationships, to develop social support networks, and to develop realistic expectations that allow them to deal with crises or other issues that may be contributing to their depression. Women with perinatal depression are most commonly treated with antidepressants, which are medications used to treat depression. They may help improve the way the brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should notify their health care provider before starting antidepressants so their&nbsp;health care provider can work to minimize the baby’s exposure to the medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take antidepressants during pregnancy is very low; however, women should work with their&nbsp;health care provider to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and to find the best solution for their situation. Women may need to try several different medications before finding the one that improves their symptoms and has manageable side effects.
Antidepressants take time—usually 6 to 8 weeks—to work, and symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give medication a chance before deciding whether or not it works.
Do not stop taking antidepressants without the help of a health care provider. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. When a woman and her health care provider have decided it is time to stop the medication, the health care provider will help her to decrease the dose slowly and safely.
After the birth of a child, many women experience a drop in certain hormones, which can lead to feelings of depression. FDA has approved one medication, called brexanolone, specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. Administered in a hospital, this drug works to relieve depression by restoring the levels of these hormones. It is important to understand that depression is a medical condition that impacts the mother, the child, and the family. Spouses, partners, family members, and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of perinatal depression in a new mother. Treatment is central to recovery. Family members can encourage the mother to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.

Depression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.
To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.
There are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances. Includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities. (Also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder)
Consists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years. Depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression. Depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. A severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see). Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributed to another medical condition) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others 9 e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)
Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)
Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The episode is not attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria 1-3 represents a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a>, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion 1, which may resemble a depressive episode. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity.
In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: Major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. Specify if: With anxious distress (pg. 210-211)
With mixed features (pg. 211)
With melancholic features (pg. 211-212)
With atypical features (pg. 212)
With mood-congruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
With catatonia (pg. 213) [Coding Note: Use additional code F06.1]
With peripartum onset (pg. 213)
With seasonal pattern (applies to pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes) (pg. 214) Major depressive disorder is defined by the presence of at least one major depressive episode occurring in the absence of a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day, nearly every day (Criterion 1). The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes: Changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity
Decreased energy
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. To count toward a diagnosis of a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared with the individual's pre-episode status. The symptoms must occur nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation, which must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs to occur once. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly increased effort. The presenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest. The failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near delusional guilt.
The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps' (Criterion 1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, 'not caring anymore,' or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion 1.2)
Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations. In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion 1.3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion 1.3). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too ealry and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume)

Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>) <br>This diagnosis cannot coexist with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a>, or <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a>, though it can coexist with others, including <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Conduct Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/conduct-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Conduct Disorder</a>, and <a data-href="Substance Use Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/substance-use-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Substance Use Disorder</a> s. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. Chronic, severe, persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations: Temper outbursts: These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others).
They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion 3) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria 5 and 6). Chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion 4) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Consistent gender difference in prevalence have not been reported in population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance. The diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (6-18 years).
Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. A relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of: <br><a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>

<br><a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A family history may be a risk factor. Those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The same behavior deficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. Socioeconomic factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as post-conflict zones or communities affected by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and transitory. While irritability has a strong genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role. Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common. <br>Differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> and <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> requires particularly careful assessment. <br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> s in children involved longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child. During a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baselines. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. The irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder required severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. <br>In only approximately 15% of individuals with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. There is a more prominent mood component among individuals with mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. It should also be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood patterns. Children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. Children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual's mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice-weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. These two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. <br>The strongest overlap is with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. <br>If children have symptoms that meet criteria for <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a> and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Depression Disorder due to Another Medical Condition]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/depression-disorder-due-to-another-medical-condition.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Depression Disorder due to Another Medical Condition.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mood Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. But like people with anorexia, they often fear gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/bulimia-nervosa.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Eating Disorders/Bulimia Nervosa.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Binge Eating Disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Binge eating disorder&nbsp;is characterized by recurrent binge eating episodes during which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating. Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge eating episodes are not followed by purging, excessive exercise or fasting. As a result, people with binge eating disorder often are overweight or obese. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/binge-eating-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Eating Disorders/Binge Eating Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anorexia Nervosa]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Anorexia nervosa&nbsp;is characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health; a relentless pursuit of thinness; a distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight; and extremely disturbed eating behavior. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely malnourished. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).
A past year prevalence estimate for anorexia nervosa was not generated in the NCS-R sample of respondents.

Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person’s eating behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia nervosa. Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), median age of onset was 21 years-old for binge eating disorder and 18 years-old for both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Based on diagnostic interview data from the NCS-R, the data below indicate the past year prevalence of each type of eating disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&nbsp;can develop after exposure to a potentially traumatic event that is beyond a typical stressor. Events that may lead to PTSD include, but are not limited to, violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, combat, and other forms of violence. Exposure to events like these is common. About one half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but most do not develop PTSD. People who experience PTSD may have persistent, frightening thoughts and memories of the event(s), experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or may be easily startled. In severe forms, PTSD can significantly impair a person's ability to function at work, at home, and socially. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Anxiety Disorders/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panic Disorder]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Anxiety Disorders/Panic Disorder.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:11:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Start with a bowl of apples (or any fruit). Pass the bowl around and have each person take one item. Mindfully observe the piece of fruit for a few minutes. When the bell rings everyone puts the fruit back into the bowl and then see if each person can "recognize" their original fruit.
Instructions: First take your piece of fruit and weigh it up in your hands. Get a sense of the texture of the skin, the temperature, the weight, how it feels in the palm of your hand, how it feels as you run your fingertips across its surface. What do you notice here? Spend a few moments doing this.
Next, we are going to use our sense of smell to breathe in the scent of the fruit. What do you notice here? Try to stay with just sensing the fruit, perhaps notice if your mind begins to make associations.
Your mind will likely wander or begin thinking about things as you move through this exercise, so just notice make a note of these thoughts, and come back to paying full attention using your five senses.
Next, take a good look at the fruit. Noticing its visual qualities - color, shape, any irregularities, the stalk, surface texture. Just take it in - looking for details. Keep an eye out for any tendency to make comparisons or judge the fruit! You'd be surprised how often our mind rushes to judgements.
You could try next bringing the fruit up to your ear and listening to the sound it makes when you squeeze it or tap it. What sound does a fruit make? (I'll bet you never wondered that before!)
Next, take a few moments to feel your fruit. Noticing how it feels. Is it smooth? Is it rough?
Bring the practice to a close when you are ready.
When you are finished, it's good to reflect on the exercise... what did you notice? Was anything surprising? Where did your mind go? What do you miss when you are on autopilot? How might the skill of mindfulness and observing be helpful to you in your daily life? Under what circumstances might you use this skill? ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/observing-a-piece-of-fruit.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Observing a Piece of Fruit.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Therapist Activities]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This activity is to help identify the similarities and differences we may have. We want to honor and acknowledge those differences but also brings to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. This process might prove difficult or awkward. This is about getting to know each other and breaking down stereotypes. You can choose if and how you participate. This acticity is simple. Each one of us will read a statement. If the statement is something you have experienced, you cross the line. We will then reset and read the next statement. This exercise has to be done in complete silence.
The purpose of this exercise is to help students become more aware of the many types of diversity that exist and to find students who share the same experiences. For this exercise, students form a line across the classroom. Students are asked to step forward and then back into the line based on questions asked by the instructor. Start with questions that are non-threatening to get students comfortable with the exercise. Students can choose to “pass” if they want. Vary the questions to suit your group of students. Listening: Let’s have silence throughout the exercise – no talking, snickering, giggling, etc. Silence will allow all of us to participate fully. Silence will also enable us to experience our personal thoughts and feelings more deeply. Respect: It is imperative that we respect the dignity of each person who is here. Everything that is shared should remain confidential. Nothing that is offered should leave this room. Each statement will require you to make the decision crossing the line or not crossing the line. There are no right or wrong answers. NO PRESSURE. No one here is under any pressure to respond in any particular way to any of the questions. If you have any doubts about sharing some part of yourself, you should feel perfectly comfortable with your decision not to step forward.
What kind of feelings did you have as you participated?
How did you feel when there were fewer of you on one side of the room?
How did the movement of others influence you?
What did you learn through this activity that can make our group more welcoming. Walk across the line if your favorite color is blue. Look into the eyes of those you brought with you. Look at those you left behind. Allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling. Walk back across the line.
Questions: You prefer the city. You have visited another country. You have never flown. You know very little about your cultural heritage. You are the oldest in your family. You have lost someone you loved. You are from Ohio. You enjoy sports. You are an only child. You got picked on in school. Your parents divorced. You consider yourself a religious person. You prefer Coke to Pepsi.
You prefer vanilla to chocolate.
You have been in love
You have had surgery. You have lived in another state. You know someone who has been sexually assaulted. You have felt alone, unwelcomed, afraid. You knew someone who has attempted to die by suicide. You have cried at least once this year for someone or something other than yourself. You or someone you know is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. You have been a bystander to a racial, sexual, or cultural joke. You have read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. You did not cross the line in a previous statement when you should have. You are willing to understand, support, and celebrate diversity. If you have not crossed the line during this activity, cross it now. Here are some additional questions: Walk across the line if you have ever experienced a bad hair day.
Walk across the line if you are undecided about your major. Walk across the line if your parents are divorced. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is in a gang. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about lives in poverty. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about has been homeless. Walk across the line if you have been told or think you are fat. Walk across the line if someone you care about has been abused physically, psychologically, or sexually. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is dependent on alcohol or drugs.
Walk across the line if you know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Walk across the line if you know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDS. Walk across the line if you have been put down by someone else and it hurt you. Walk across the line if you put someone down and you knew it hurt them. At the conclusion of this exercise, ask students what they learned from it. The usual comment is that students are not aware that so many share the same experiences.

Ho was the last week? Highs? Lows? Accomplishments? Stressors?
Triggers: What emotional states have you experienced? What situations did you encounter that were difficult? How did you handle triggers? Address any significant changes in your life including in your living environment, employment, relationships, etc. Is there anything you would like to focus on today in group? Any questions or personal situations you would like to discuss with the group. It helps to talk about the things your group members are doing well first. Start with the positive before providing more challenging feedback. Empathy statements are helpful. Put yourself in the other person's shoes. Self-relating statements are also beneficial. Explain how you have had similar thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Some suggestions for how to start feedback include: "I really thought you did a good job talking about..."

What is your current emotional state? Do Frank Weber's emotions assignment. Color in the amount of each feeling inside you in this moment. Explain why you have that level of the emotion
Emotional Alphabet Activity Identify as many emotions as possible for each letter of the alphabet. Role-Play In groups of two, they are to create a scenario based on an emotion and role-play it for the group. They cannot actually state the emotion, or describe it in detail, but rather show the situation that elicits that emotion. The other group has to guess the emotion being displayed and explain how they saw that emotion (verbals and non-verbals)
Have clients select feeling words or emotion cards and act out that card. Have clients select feeling words and roleplay when they felt this way. Collage Cut out pictures that relate to emotions. Find as many emotions as possible. Label the emotion. Feelings Charades Write different emotions on cards, clients draw a card to select an emotion. She then acts out the emotion without using any words. The other clients guess the emotion based on the client's facial expressions and other non-verbal clues/cues. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/emotion-regulation/emotions-activities.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Emotion Regulation/Emotions Activities.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Emotional Awareness Lesson Plan]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Was it helpful? If so, how? If not, what got in the way?&nbsp; As we move into today’s group and the introduction of new skills, here is some “food for thought” from Linehan:&nbsp;&nbsp; “This book is dedicated to all the clients of the world who think that no one is thinking of them. I considered telling you that I would practice skills for you, so you don’t have to practice them. But then I realized that if I did, you would not learn how to be skillful yourself. So, instead, I wish you skillful means, and I wish that you find these skills useful.”&nbsp; Facilitate Mindfulness Guessing Item Activity: Start by educating on mindfulness (observing, describing, participating, being non-judgmental, one-mindful, and effective). Explore how these aspects of mindfulness will be integrated into the activity. Put items into a bag. Go around the room, everyone closes their eyes except the describer. The describer describes the item you gave them starting with broad descriptions and moving into more specifics. I usually write on the board types of descriptions in case the person gets stuck such as the shape, purpose, feel, color, weight, size, texture, smell, taste, etc. As the describer begins describing the object, the rest of the group begins guessing what it is, until some gets it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Wise Mind Activity:&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding what is emotion mind, rational mind, and wise mind.&nbsp; Invite clients to draw what it looks like for you to be in rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Wise Mind Activity: [SKIP]&nbsp; Chain of commitments to wise mind: cut slips of paper, write or draw descriptions of wise mind, hand the chains in your room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise:&nbsp; Ask group members to identify one thing in their life right now that they know they need to accept. They can take a moment to identify that thing, write it down, and maybe even describe why they belief they need to accept it. Then they rate their level of acceptance on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 being no acceptance and 10 being full acceptance – if they have written it down, they are beyond a 0 which is positive).&nbsp;&nbsp; View Linehan introducing “Practicing Radical Acceptance”&nbsp; <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI" target="_self">https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI</a>&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding practicing acceptance.&nbsp; Introduce worksheets.&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise: [SKIP]&nbsp; Defining Myself Circle: Draw a large circle on a piece of paper.

The accident was precipitated by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK-1000 reactor and operator errors. In particular, the RBMK reactor had an unstable design (a positive void coefficient), meaning a loss of coolant could accelerate the nuclear reaction, and its control rods had graphite tips that initially increased reactivity when inserted (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output could increase if cooling,other safety mechanisms have been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output%20could%20increase%20if%20cooling,other%20safety%20mechanisms%20have%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). During the test, operators disabled critical safety systems and drove the reactor to a low-power, unstable state. A sudden power surge ensued when they attempted an emergency shutdown, leading to massive energy buildup.<br>Moments later, a steam explosion blew apart the reactor core, followed by a second explosion (likely hydrogen or another steam blast) that demolished the reactor building and exposed the core to the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The blasts ignited fires, including a graphite fire in the reactor core, that burned for ten days. The underlying causes trace to poor safety culture and secrecy in the USSR at the time. An investigation later concluded that the accident was “the result of a flawed reactor design… operated with inadequately trained personnel,” exacerbated by Cold War isolation and lack of safety culture (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The April 1986 disaster at,lack of any safety culture" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20April%201986%20disaster%20at,lack%20of%20any%20safety%20culture" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In short, inherent reactor vulnerabilities and human mistakes combined to trigger the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.<br>The immediate human toll of Chernobyl was severe. Two plant workers were killed on the night of the explosion – one instantly, and another shortly after from injuries (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the days that followed, dozens of firefighters and first responders who heroically fought the fires received extremely high radiation doses. <a data-href="Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)</a> devastated many of them: 28 emergency workers died from ARS within a few weeks (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In total, roughly 30 people died in the initial aftermath (plant staff and firefighters) as a direct result of the explosions and acute radiation exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Dozens more suffered serious radiation injuries.<br>Soviet authorities evacuated the surrounding population as the scale of the disaster became evident. The nearby company town of Pripyat (population ~49,000) was not informed of the danger on the first day. Only 36 hours after the accident, on April 27, buses finally moved all Pripyat residents out, turning it into a ghost city (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion zone was established 36,8" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion%20zone%20was%20established%2036,8" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Over the next two weeks, the evacuation zone was expanded to a 30 km radius, ultimately relocating about 116,000 people by mid-May 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the years following, evacuations and resettlement continued as more contaminated villages were emptied – eventually some 350,000 people in total were relocated due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,result of the accident%2C but" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,result%20of%20the%20accident%2C%20but" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Evacuees left behind homes and belongings forever; many received only moderate radiation doses (most under 50 mSv, though some got higher) during the short delay (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=match at L324 evacuated received,received 100 mSv or more" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=match%20at%20L324%20evacuated%20received,received%20100%20mSv%20or%20more" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The sudden displacement and fear caused significant trauma among the population.Offsite, there were no immediate deaths, but radiation sickness symptoms did appear in some of the local populace soon after (e.g. headaches, metallic taste). Tens of millions across Europe were exposed to low levels of fallout (see environmental impact below), and children in affected areas were given iodine tablets in some regions to block radioactive iodine uptake. The psychological shock and confusion were immense – for Soviet citizens who were kept largely in the dark initially, and for neighboring countries alarmed by the drifting radiation.<br>The Chernobyl accident caused an unprecedented release of radioactive material into the environment. The initial explosion and subsequent fire ejected at least 5% of the reactor’s radioactive core into the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). A towering plume of radioactive gases and particles drifted with the winds for over a week. The most intense fallout blanketed areas close to the plant. A 4-6 km² pine forest immediately downwind was saturated with radiation; the trees literally died and turned rust-red within days, earning it the name the “Red Forest.” This 600-hectare patch of woodland absorbed lethal doses (up to ~100 Gray), killing the pines and many small animals in the area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Soviet crews later bulldozed and buried about a square mile of this forest to remove the highly contaminated biomass ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=down and buried about a,The Soviet nuclear power authorities" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=down%20and%20buried%20about%20a,The%20Soviet%20nuclear%20power%20authorities" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). In the worst-hit zones, animals also succumbed – for example, horses on an island 6 km away died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by extreme radioiodine exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Livestock had to be slaughtered and crops were ruined across large swathes of land. Water and soil near the site were severely contaminated; radiological “hot spots” (with dangerous levels of cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, etc.) dotted the map in northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.<br>The radioactive plume did not stop at the Soviet borders. Within two days, winds carried radionuclides into Eastern and Northern Europe. On April 28, sensors at the Forsmark nuclear plant in Sweden (over 1,000 km away) detected radiation, forcing an investigation that revealed the source was Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant%2C,rising radiation levels%2C but a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the%20Forsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%2C,rising%20radiation%20levels%2C%20but%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). As the cloud spread, rain-outs deposited contamination in patches across Europe. Notably, parts of Belarus (to the north) received heavy fallout, as did areas of Scandinavia, Poland, Austria, and the UK. In the United Kingdom, for example, radioactive cesium from Chernobyl fell on upland pastures; in the immediate aftermath, the government restricted the movement of some 4.2 million sheep across 9,700 farms to prevent tainted meat entering the food supply (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Some of these farm restrictions remained in place for decades (the last were lifted in 2012) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) – a testament to the persistent environmental impact. Across Europe, a wide range of foods (milk, leafy vegetables, wild game, mushrooms, etc.) had to be tested or discarded in 1986 due to fallout contamination.<br>In the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, the environment was badly scarred. The reactor fire belched radioactive iodine-131, cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium and other isotopes into the air (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). Iodine-131 (with an 8-day half-life) delivered high doses to the thyroids of grazing animals and children who drank local milk in the first weeks, causing later thyroid disorders. Heavier elements fell close to the plant, creating an extremely hazardous zone within ~10 km. The Pripyat River and Dnieper water basin were threatened by runoff; emergency crews dug up topsoil and built dams to prevent contaminants from spreading through waterways. Despite these efforts, ecological damage was acute: plants died, and some animal populations in high-dose areas crashed or stopped reproducing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The immediate environmental legacy of Chernobyl was a poisoned landscape – an estimated 77 kilograms of radioactive material were lofted into the atmosphere, traveling as far as 2,000 km away (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>), and leaving a footprint of contamination that would last for generations.<br>The Chernobyl disaster had significant immediate political repercussions, both domestically within the Soviet Union and internationally. In the USSR, the accident exposed the deep flaws in the Soviet government’s crisis management and secrecy. Initially, authorities were slow to admit the severity of the situation. Local evacuations were delayed and the broader public was not informed promptly. Only on April 28 – two days after the explosion, once Swedish monitors raised global alarm – did the Soviet government make a brief 20-second announcement on state TV acknowledging an accident at Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An investigative commission has been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An%20investigative%20commission%20has%20been" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). This minimalist statement offered few details, reflecting the regime’s instinct to cover up bad news. Such lack of transparency put citizens at risk and angered neighboring countries. Gorbachev himself did not publicly address Chernobyl until May 14, 1986, more than three weeks later. The delay and initial secrecy eroded public trust. Soviet citizens in Ukraine and Belarus, seeing helicopters overhead and troops moving without clear explanation, felt a sense of betrayal that they were not immediately warned of the invisible danger.<br>Internationally, Chernobyl proved to be a public relations disaster for the Soviet Union. The USSR was criticized for its failure to promptly alert the world and for rejecting outside help initially. The incident strained relations with Western Europe – for example, Sweden, Finland, and others demanded explanations as radioactive clouds crossed their territories. The political fallout added pressure on Soviet leadership to be more open and cooperative. The disaster became a catalyst for Glasnost (openness): it demonstrated the deadly cost of government secrecy. Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that “the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl… even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union” five years later (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls The nuclear meltdown at,The commission was to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls%20The%20nuclear%20meltdown%20at,The%20commission%20was%20to" target="_self">VIEW: Turning point at Chernobyl — Mikhail S Gorbachev</a>). While historians debate the extent of Chernobyl’s role in the USSR’s dissolution, it undeniably undermined the credibility of Soviet authorities. The tragedy spurred newfound environmental activism and public questioning of nuclear safety in the Eastern Bloc. In summary, the immediate political consequence was a profound shock that forced the Soviet government to confront its own shortcomings, setting in motion changes that transcended the issue of nuclear power.<br>In the decades since 1986, extensive studies have been conducted on Chernobyl’s health impact. The most clear-cut long-term health effect has been a sharp increase in thyroid cancer cases among those who were children or adolescents in affected areas at the time of the accident. Radioactive iodine-131 released from the reactor accumulated in pastures and was ingested via milk; this led to an epidemic of thyroid disorders. By 2005, over 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported in exposed children/teens (notably in Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Fortunately, thyroid cancer is largely treatable – the vast majority of patients survived. As of 2011, 15 deaths had been attributed to these Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Aggressive screening and treatment campaigns in the 1990s saved many lives. Aside from thyroid issues, major epidemiological surveys have not conclusively linked the Chernobyl accident to a generalized increase in other cancers or health effects in the broader population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), “apart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In particular, studies have not found a definitive rise in leukemia, solid tumors, or birth defects that can be attributed to Chernobyl radiation exposure in the general population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>However, it is important to note that estimating long-term deaths is complex and subject to debate. Low-dose radiation effects are hard to tease out from normal cancer rates. Some scientific models project that over the lifetime of those exposed, Chernobyl’s fallout could cause a few thousand excess cancer deaths (for example, one projection suggested about 4,000 future cancer deaths among the higher-exposed groups in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are expected from other causes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are%20expected%20from%20other%20causes" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Other analyses, often using the linear no-threshold model, predict higher numbers – for instance, a 2006 report (TORCH) estimated 30,000 to 60,000 worldwide cancer deaths in the long run due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Anti-nuclear organizations have cited figures in the tens of thousands as well (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). These larger estimates are controversial and not universally accepted; they rely on statistical assumptions and include very low-dose regions where any effect would be too small to measure. The consensus of bodies like the WHO and UNSCEAR is that outside of thyroid cancers, Chernobyl’s long-term health impacts (while tragic on an individual level) have been limited in scope relative to initial fears (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Nonetheless, each of those statistics reflects personal tragedies and serious illnesses that have affected thousands of families.<br>Beyond physical health, the psychological and social effects have been profound. The disaster uprooted entire communities and created an enduring sense of fear. Studies have found elevated rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse among Chernobyl evacuees and residents of contaminated areas ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015%29" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). The term “radiophobia” has been used to describe the chronic fear of radiation exposure that many people carry, sometimes causing more harm (in stress and mental health) than the radiation itself. Being labeled a “Chernobyl victim” or “survivor” led to social stigma and hopelessness in some cases (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Populations in affected areas often reported worse self-assessed health than objective medical exams would indicate, due to perceived danger (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Thus, a major long-term impact of Chernobyl has been on mental health and community cohesion. The disaster also had inter-generational aspects: while studies (including a 2021 whole-genome study) have not found evidence of significant genetic mutations passed to children of survivors or liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1929 Chernobyl liquidators,generational genetic effects.[ 223" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1929%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,generational%20genetic%20effects.%5B%20223" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>), young people from the region have grown up under the shadow of Chernobyl’s legacy, which influences their social and economic opportunities.<br>In summary, nearly 39 years on, Chernobyl’s health legacy is a mixed picture. There have been thousands of thyroid cancers (largely survivable), and possibly some increase in other cancers and health issues among the most exposed, but no mass epidemic of radiation-induced disease outside those categories that can be unambiguously demonstrated (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The trauma and displacement caused by the disaster, however, left lasting scars on public health in the form of psychological distress and disrupted lives.Paradoxically, the long-term ecological effects of Chernobyl include both persistent environmental contamination and the revival of wildlife in the abandoned zone. In the immediate aftermath, Chernobyl created one of the most radioactive environments on the planet, devastating local ecosystems. Yet over time, as humans withdrew from the area, nature has shown a remarkable capacity to rebound in many respects.<br>On the negative side, the environment remains contaminated with long-lived radionuclides that will persist for decades or more. Isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life ~30 years) and strontium-90 (half-life ~29 years) still taint the soil and vegetation in the Exclusion Zone and beyond. In the worst hot spots (e.g. the Red Forest and near the reactor), soil and plant life are loaded with radionuclide levels that inhibit normal biological processes. Studies have found increased mutation rates in many organisms: one analysis showed plant and animal mutation rates in the Chernobyl region were up to 20 times higher than normal background levels (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). There is evidence of elevated mortality and reduced reproductive success in some species living in the most contaminated areas, consistent with radiation-induced genetic damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). For example, some birds in high-radiation zones have been observed to have smaller brain sizes or cataracts, and fewer insects (like bees, butterflies, spiders) are found in these areas in some studies. Trees in certain plots grow more slowly due to radionuclide uptake. Forest ecosystems have been altered: the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) in soil were initially impaired by radiation, leading to a thick layer of semi-decomposed leaf litter that persisted for years. Even today, wild boar in parts of Germany and Austria still show high cesium levels from eating Chernobyl-tainted mushrooms and soils (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported,lamb industry in Norway were" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Agricultural%20Authority%20reported,lamb%20industry%20in%20Norway%20were" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). And periodic wildfires in the Exclusion Zone can remobilize radionuclides, as burning plants release cesium and strontium back into the air – a concern that persists each fire season. Thus, ecologically, Chernobyl created a chronic environmental hazard in the contaminated regions: a “dirty” ecosystem where radioactive elements circulate and will slowly decay over generations.<br>On the other hand, the absence of human activity in the vast Exclusion Zone has allowed wildlife to flourish in unexpected ways. With 2,600 km² of land (in Ukraine) largely free from people, the area has become an unintended wildlife sanctuary. By the 2010s, biologists conducting long-term censuses observed that many large animal populations were thriving. A 2015 scientific study using animal track counts and camera traps found no evidence of reduced mammal abundance in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone compared to similar uncontaminated nature reserves – in fact, populations of elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves were as high or higher than in less disturbed reserves (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The study concluded that chronic radiation had not significantly affected these wildlife populations; instead, the removal of humans (and associated activities like farming, hunting, logging) allowed nature to rebound vigorously (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Subsequent research and observations have noted an increase in biodiversity: the Exclusion Zone now hosts species rarely seen in the region for decades prior. Wolves roam in large numbers (some estimates suggest the zone has one of the highest densities of wolves in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Lynx and Eurasian brown bears – species that were once extirpated locally – have been spotted within the zone. Endangered European bison have been reintroduced and are breeding. The Przewalski’s horse, a rare wild equine, was released into the zone in the 1990s and now herds of these horses graze the grasslands of Chernobyl. Moose, foxes, badgers, wild boar, deer, and dozens of bird species inhabit the forests and marshes. Even the Pripyat town itself and derelict buildings are used by wildlife (e.g. nesting birds, small mammals). In essence, in the long term, Chernobyl’s ecosystem has transformed into a unique experiment: a landscape of high radiation pockets but flourishing wildlife, illustrating the resilience of nature when freed from human pressures (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some scientists have termed it a “accidental wildlife reserve.” Photographic evidence and surveys by organizations like the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve (established by Ukraine in 2016) document robust ecosystems, though still affected by the residue of contamination.<br>It’s important to balance this picture: radiation is certainly not “good” for wildlife, and in highly contaminated spots the damage to organisms is real (for instance, smaller creatures with short lifespans show higher mutation impacts). Scientists continue to debate the extent of sublethal effects on Chernobyl’s wildlife – some studies find more genetic abnormalities or shorter lifespans in animals from radioactive hot spots, while others point to the abundant population numbers as a sign of adaptation or tolerance (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). The likely reality is that many species have been able to recover because the benefit of habitat free from humans outweighs the detriments of the radiation levels they experience (which for most of the zone are low to moderate now). The Chernobyl zone has thus become a living laboratory for studying chronic low-dose radiation on ecosystems, with ongoing research that will inform ecology and radiobiology for decades. From an ecological perspective, Chernobyl’s legacy is a landscape of contrasts: lingering contamination and altered biological processes, alongside a teeming revival of wildlife in what has become one of Europe’s largest rewilded areas.<br>The Chernobyl disaster’s ramifications extended into the geopolitical and policy realm, influencing nuclear energy policies and international cooperation. In the Soviet Union, as mentioned, Chernobyl was a catalyst for Glasnost and political reform. It forced Soviet leadership to cooperate more with international authorities – for example, in August 1986 (just months after the accident), the USSR sent a delegation to the IAEA in Vienna to openly present details of the accident to the world, a notable break from past secrecy ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were subsequently restarted but all,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were%20subsequently%20restarted%20but%20all,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Gorbachev’s policies of openness were reinforced by the recognition that hiding disasters was untenable. In the bigger picture, Chernobyl “led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The Chernobyl disaster was a,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20Chernobyl%20disaster%20was%20a,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some commentators even argue that the disaster contributed to the fall of the USSR by exposing its systemic problems and costing enormous resources – as noted earlier, Gorbachev later said Chernobyl was a more important factor in the Soviet collapse than his own reform efforts (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C particularly between East and,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C%20particularly%20between%20East%20and,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>On the international stage, nuclear safety was fundamentally re-examined. Chernobyl was the first nuclear accident to directly result in radiation fatalities (and remains one of only two Level 7 accidents, along with Fukushima 2011). This spurred a wave of new protocols and cooperation. Western and Soviet-bloc experts began collaborating to prevent another Chernobyl. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was established, linking operators from over 30 countries to share safety information and peer reviews (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since 1989%2C over 1000 nuclear,in the Nuclear Power Industry" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since%201989%2C%20over%201000%20nuclear,in%20the%20Nuclear%20Power%20Industry" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

Design changes were rapidly instituted for RBMK reactors – all remaining RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania, etc.) were retrofitted with safety upgrades: e.g. adding neutron absorbers, faster shut-down systems, and eliminating the positive void coefficient at low power (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications have been made to,see Post accident changes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications%20have%20been%20made%20to,see%20Post%20accident%20changes" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) so that a Chernobyl-type runaway reaction “is now virtually impossible” in those reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). International aid (through organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped finance these safety improvements and the eventual decommissioning of Chernobyl’s other reactors.<br>Public opinion toward nuclear energy also shifted significantly after Chernobyl, especially in Europe. The accident fueled anti-nuclear movements and policy reversals in several countries. For example, in Italy, Chernobyl triggered a national referendum in November 1987 in which over 80% of voters chose to abandon nuclear power; as a result, Italy shut down its existing reactors and scrapped plans for new ones (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C only the widespread popular,a question of individual conscience" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C%20only%20the%20widespread%20popular,a%20question%20of%20individual%20conscience" target="_self">Nuclear Power, No Thanks! The Aftermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the Nuclear Power Referendum of 1987 | Environment &amp; Society Portal</a>). In West Germany, large anti-nuclear protests took place, and although Germany did not immediately phase out nuclear (that came later), Chernobyl planted seeds of skepticism that eventually contributed to Germany’s decision to end nuclear power by 2022. Other countries like Austria (which had completed a nuclear plant but never fueled it, due to a referendum) felt vindicated. Even far from Europe, Chernobyl had an impact: nations such as the United States and UK reviewed their emergency preparedness; some countries paused or scaled back nuclear projects. The accident underscored that a nuclear disaster is not confined by borders, leading to improved international radiation monitoring networks and emergency response coordination (for instance, the EU created rapid notification systems for nuclear incidents).<br>Geopolitically, Chernobyl also imposed huge economic costs on the USSR (and later Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) – estimated hundreds of billions of dollars over time – contributing to economic stress. Belarus in particular, which received around 70% of the fallout, spent up to 25% of its national budget on Chernobyl consequences in the late 80s and 90s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In the aftermath of the,Ecology of the Chernobyl Catastrophe" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20the,Ecology%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Catastrophe" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More than 1,borne particles drifted to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More%20than%201,borne%20particles%20drifted%20to" target="_self">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). This influenced those republics’ politics and relations; for example, arguments over how to pay for Chernobyl recovery were part of the rising tensions in the dissolving Soviet Union. In Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, Chernobyl left a legacy that shaped its environmental and energy policy – the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl (Unit 3) was only shut down in December 2000 as part of an agreement with Western countries that provided financial aid for safer energy projects ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).In summary, the long-term political and geopolitical impact of Chernobyl was far-reaching. It accelerated the end of the Soviet era, prompted a global reckoning on nuclear safety, fostered East-West scientific cooperation, and strengthened international regulatory frameworks. It also invigorated citizen movements and influenced national policies on energy. The world’s nuclear industry after 1986 underwent significant reforms in training, reactor design, risk communication, and emergency planning, all under the shadow of lessons learned from Chernobyl.<br>Right after the explosions, an urgent priority was to extinguish the fires and contain the damage at the power plant. In the early hours of April 26, plant workers and local firefighters rushed to the scene with no full knowledge of the radiation hazard. A fire raged on the roof of Unit 3 (adjacent to the destroyed Unit 4) as well as throughout the wreckage of Unit 4. Fire brigades worked feverishly to douse the flames and keep them from spreading to other reactor buildings. By 5:00 AM, most of the external fires (on the roof and around the building) were extinguished, thanks to these responders – many of whom absorbed massive radiation doses in the process (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). However, inside Reactor 4, the graphite core fire was burning like a giant ember, uncontrollably spewing radiation. It continued to burn for ten days, not fully going out until May 6, 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) when there was no more material left to burn.<br>To combat the reactor fire, the Soviet authorities initiated unprecedented measures. Within 24 hours, the military organized helicopter drops to smother the exposed core. Pilots flew directly over the glowing reactor, dumping load after load of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron into the inferno. In total, more than 5,000 tonnes of these materials were dropped from the air in the weeks after the accident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). It was an incredibly dangerous mission – roughly 600 Soviet helicopter pilots and crew participated, many receiving high radiation doses as they hovered above the destroyed reactor (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The intent was to choke the fire and absorb neutrons to prevent any renewed nuclear chain reaction. (Later analysis suggests much of the dropped material did not stay in the core but the effort likely helped cool and bury the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).) Firefighters also pumped water into the reactor ruins until fears of a steam explosion in the basement halted that approach. Additionally, teams of engineers drained and vented the plant’s steam suppression pools under the reactor (the “bubbler” pools) to remove water and prevent a potential secondary steam explosion that could have ejected even more radioactivity. This harrowing drain operation required three men to enter radioactive flooded corridors – an oft-cited act of bravery (they survived due to quick work and later medical care).<br>Once the immediate crisis of fire and potential further explosions was under control, the focus shifted to cleaning up the massive radioactive mess – a task that would take years. The Soviet Union marshaled an enormous workforce for this, later known as the “liquidators.” These were civil and military personnel conscripted to liquidate (eliminate) the consequences of the accident. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 600,000 people from all over the USSR were officially recognized as Chernobyl liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). They included firefighters, soldiers, engineers, technicians, miners, medical staff, and even volunteers. In 1986–87 alone, about 240,000 recovery workers were on site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). Many were young conscripts in the Soviet Army sent to do manual decontamination work.<br>The liquidators’ tasks were varied and often perilous. In the immediate aftermath, one critical job was to clear the highly radioactive debris from the roof of Unit 3 and the surroundings of Unit 4. Chunks of graphite core and reactor fuel had been hurled onto the rooftops and ground. Radiation on the roof was so intense (up to 10,000 R/hour in some spots) that even 1-2 minutes of exposure could deliver a dangerous dose (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Remote-controlled robots were attempted to shovel debris, but most failed quickly due to the radiation frying their electronics. Thus, human soldiers – dubbed “bio-robots” – had to do it. Working in shifts of only about 40 to 90 seconds each, men sprinted onto the roof, shoveled a few scoops of debris over the edge, and ran back, never to return to that spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1173 Chernobyl liquidators,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1173%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl liquidators from the military%2C,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl%20liquidators%20from%20the%20military%2C,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Each did only one or two trips. By this method, the rooftops were cleared enough to allow construction of the shelter later.<br>Other liquidator crews decontaminated the ground: they used bulldozers and hand tools to scrape up topsoil, which was radioactive, and buried it in trenches. They washed down buildings, roads, and even livestock to remove fallout. A special substance called “Barda” (a sticky resin) was sprayed over large areas by trucks and helicopters to trap radioactive dust and prevent it from re-aerosolizing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters regularly sprayed large areas,2018%2C parked in a field" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters%20regularly%20sprayed%20large%20areas,2018%2C%20parked%20in%20a%20field" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). In Pripyat and other evacuated towns, teams went house to house to collect and dispose of irradiated belongings and to euthanize abandoned pets and livestock (to prevent them from spreading contamination). Miners were brought in to tunnel underneath the reactor; they excavated a cavity and poured concrete to create a cooling slab under the smoldering core (“corium”) lava, to prevent it from melting through to groundwater – this prevented a potential groundwater contamination catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of trees were cut down. Contaminated vehicles, helicopters, and equipment were taken out of service – many were buried or dumped in a vehicle graveyard in the Zone (some remain there to this day, rusting and still radioactive (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The official contaminated zones saw,up effort lasting seven" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20official%20contaminated%20zones%20saw,up%20effort%20lasting%20seven" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>)).<br>The liquidators often worked under harsh, hasty conditions with inconsistent protection. Early on, many were not fully informed of the risks. They wore simple cotton jumpsuits or ill-fitting lead aprons and rudimentary respirators, if anything. As time went on, safety measures improved somewhat, but thousands of liquidators exceeded recommended radiation doses (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1258 ,99" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1258%20,99" target="_self">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The average dose for the ~600k liquidators is estimated at about 120 mSv (12 rem) per person (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_self">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>), which is significant (roughly 50 times a typical yearly background dose). Some individuals, particularly those in 1986 roof and core cleanup, received much higher doses (several Sieverts in a few cases). Many liquidators later suffered health issues, and they are honored today for their sacrifice. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus commemorate Liquidators’ Day (often on December 14, the date in 1986 when the reactor was declared sealed) to remember their contributions. These efforts by the liquidators were crucial in reducing the ongoing risk from Chernobyl – they mitigated what could have been a far worse environmental outcome by working to contain and confine the radioactive materials.<br>A monumental engineering task in 1986 was to entomb the destroyed Reactor 4 to stop further radiation release. Immediately after the accident, Reactor No.4 was an open wound spewing radioactivity, so the Soviet government undertook the construction of a massive containment structure known colloquially as the “sarcophagus.” Design work began just weeks after the accident, and construction started in June 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Despite the extreme conditions, within 206 days – by late November 1986 – the sarcophagus was completed and put in place over Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June 1986 Completed November 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June%201986%20Completed%20November%201986" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The design of the sarcophagus,The seams of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The%20design%20of%20the%20sarcophagus,The%20seams%20of" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). (Some sources cite completion in November, others in early December, but essentially seven months after the disaster.)<br>The sarcophagus was essentially a hastily built steel and concrete shield, erected around the ruins to contain the radiation. It was enormous – over 50 meters tall – and had to be assembled largely by machines and remote welders because radiation levels near the core were deadly. Engineers improvised, often working by remote control or from cranes, to bolt together steel panels and pour concrete over the reactor building’s remains. By its completion, the “Object Ukrytie” (Object Shelter, the official name) encased about 200 tons of radioactive corium (lava-like melted core fuel), plus an estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and debris inside the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building of the Chernobyl Nuclear,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Nuclear,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive contamination of the,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive%20contamination%20%20of%20the,1" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). This ad-hoc containment prevented these materials from directly escaping to the environment. The sarcophagus also incorporated ventilation to prevent heat and gas buildup, and it sealed off the reactor from rain, which would otherwise leach radioactivity into the ground.<br>Structurally, the sarcophagus was supported in part by the ruined walls of Reactor 4 and was not hermetically tight, but it dramatically reduced radiation emissions from the site. By late 1986, radiation levels around the plant had dropped significantly due to the containment and natural decay of short-lived isotopes. This allowed the other reactors at Chernobyl (Units 1, 2, and 3), which had been shut down after the accident, to be restarted over the next year with added safety upgrades. (They continued operating for years under observation; Reactor 2 was closed in 1991 after a turbine hall fire, Reactor 1 in 1996, and Reactor 3 – the last – in 2000 ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_self">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).)<br>The sarcophagus, while a feat given the circumstances, was understood to be a temporary solution with an expected lifespan of perhaps 20–30 years. By the late 1990s, it had deteriorated – the immense radiation and weathering caused cracks and weakened joints. Authorities installed jacks and braces in 1998 to prevent a collapse of the sarcophagus, as it was by then unstable (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_self">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Still, it remained an essential barrier keeping the radioactive inventory of Reactor 4 confined. The success of the initial sarcophagus was that it limited the contamination largely within the 30 km Zone and allowed recovery work to continue around the site with manageable radiation levels.<br>Recognizing the sarcophagus was aging, an international plan was developed to provide a more robust, long-term containment. This led to the New Safe Confinement (NSC) – an enormous arch-shaped structure built to enclose the old sarcophagus and reactor building entirely. The NSC was a project funded by a consortium of nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (managed by the EBRD), with design/construction by Novarka (a French-led team). Construction began in 2012. Unlike the original sarcophagus, which was built in place, the NSC was assembled on a clean pad a short distance away and later slid over Reactor 4. By 2016, the colossal assembly was complete, and in November 2016 the entire 36,000-tonne arch was pushed 327 meters on rails to cover the reactor and old sarcophagus (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and preparatory work onsite was,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and%20preparatory%20work%20onsite%20was,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling equipment were fitted in,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling%20equipment%20were%20fitted%20in,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The NSC is designed to last at least 100 years, with a robust steel frame covered by stainless cladding. It is airtight and equipped with cranes and robotic equipment on the inside. The primary purpose of the NSC is not only to keep radioactive dust from escaping, but also to enable the future dismantling of the dangerously unstable old sarcophagus and the removal of the remaining nuclear fuel and debris inside Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The hermetically sealed building will,using as few personnel as" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20hermetically%20sealed%20building%20will,using%20as%20few%20personnel%20as" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

This will be an extremely challenging task, scheduled to take decades – essentially the final phase of cleaning up Chernobyl.<br>With the NSC in place, the site is far more secure. The new structure prevents water intrusion, controls the environment around the reactor (humidity, etc.), and has filter systems to ensure no radioactive particles leak out during future dismantling work. As of today, the NSC has successfully isolated Reactor 4: radiation levels around the plant have declined further, and the risk of the old sarcophagus collapsing (which could have released dust) is mitigated. In February 2022, during the Russian invasion (discussed later), the NSC’s integrity was maintained despite military occupation of the area. A very recent incident on 14 February 2025 saw a drone strike hit the NSC’s roof, breaching its outer and inner steel panels, but radiation levels remained stable and no radioactive release occurred (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This event underscored the NSC’s importance and resilience.<br>In addition to the NSC, other cleanup infrastructure has been built: for example, a new Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISF-2) was constructed to safely store used nuclear fuel from the remaining Chernobyl reactors, completed in 2020 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent nuclear fuel storage facility,and cold tests took place" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent%20nuclear%20fuel%20storage%20facility,and%20cold%20tests%20took%20place" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Waste processing plants and monitoring systems have been established to manage the tons of radioactive waste generated by decommissioning and cleanup. The overall containment strategy is now long-term stewardship: maintain the new shelter, gradually dismantle the old one, remove and dispose of radioactive materials in a safe manner, and ensure the surrounding environment is protected.Through these massive efforts – from the bravery of the 1986 liquidators to the high-tech engineering of the NSC – the Chernobyl site has been transformed from an open reactor wreck to a contained and monitored facility. While full remediation (removal of all radioactive material) will take many more decades if not centuries, the risk of another release has been vastly reduced. Chernobyl has gone from an active crisis to a case of long-term containment, serving as a stark lesson and model in nuclear disaster management.Nearly four decades on, Chernobyl today is a very different place than it was in 1986. The reactor is silent and enclosed, nature has reclaimed much of the evacuated zone, and what was once a symbol of nuclear catastrophe has also become a site of scientific study, remembrance, and even tourism. This section covers the current conditions, including radiation levels, the status of the Exclusion Zone, ecological developments, and human activities like tourism and restoration projects, incorporating the latest available updates.<br>Ambient radiation levels in the Chernobyl region have dropped significantly since 1986, due to radioactive decay and cleanup efforts. Immediately after the accident, radiation in close proximity to the reactor could be fatal within minutes. Today, aside from a few hot spots, most of the Exclusion Zone has radiation levels that are within safe limits for short-term visits. For perspective, normal natural background radiation is about 2 mSv (millisieverts) per year (which is ~0.0002 mSv/hour). In much of the Exclusion Zone, current dose rates are only a few times above background or even equal to background in some areas (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). For example, walking around in Pripyat town for an hour might give a dose on the order of a few microsieverts – negligible in health terms. The ghost city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl plant’s perimeter, and main roads have been sufficiently decontaminated or decayed that short visits are not dangerous with basic precautions. The New Safe Confinement ensures that Reactor 4’s remains emit virtually no radiation into the outside environment; all major radioactive materials are contained within sturdy structures.<br>However, radioactive “hot spots” remain in certain parts of the Exclusion Zone, and these are unsafe for extended exposure or habitation. The most notorious is the Red Forest just west of Reactor 4. Radiation there is still extremely high – on the order of 0.4 mSv per hour (400 µSv/h) in some patches, which is “thousands of times higher than background levels and dangerous to live in” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). A person standing in the Red Forest for an hour could receive as much radiation as they normally would in several months. Needless to say, nobody is allowed to linger there, and it’s off-limits to tourists (even driving through the area, guides take care to roll up windows and not stop). Other localized hot spots include some parts of the reactor complex’s vicinity, areas where radioactive metal equipment lies in the open, or where fallout concentrated in 1986. These spots are well-mapped by authorities; warning signs mark areas of higher radiation.<br>Importantly, the radiation today is not uniform – it’s very heterogeneous. While one spot might be 0.4 mSv/h, a few hundred meters away it might drop to 0.004 mSv/h. Overall, chronic radiation levels have “plummeted” compared to the initial aftermath, and wildlife and even occasional workers can exist in the zone with only low-level exposure outside the hotspots (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether chronic radiation has any,chronically exposed to low levels" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether%20chronic%20radiation%20has%20any,chronically%20exposed%20to%20low%20levels" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_self">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Long-lived isotopes like cesium-137 have undergone over one half-life since 1986, meaning roughly half of the initial amount has decayed away. Shorter-lived isotopes (iodine-131, xenon-133, etc.) disappeared long ago. The areas that remain dangerous are primarily those with concentrated transuranic elements (like parts of the reactor debris with plutonium) or where cesium and strontium were deposited most densely (e.g. forest floor litter).<br>As of today, experts consider the Exclusion Zone safe for controlled access – scientists, workers, and tourists routinely enter for limited periods. The key is limiting time in higher-dose areas and not ingesting any contaminated materials (no eating berries or mushrooms from the zone, for example, as they concentrate radionuclides). The Ukrainian authorities have an extensive radiation monitoring network on-site. According to reports, even after incidents like forest fires or military occupation (more on that below), radiation levels remained “within normal limits” for the zone and did not pose a danger outside the immediate area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>A recent real-world “stress test” of Chernobyl’s stability occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl site and occupied the Exclusion Zone for about five weeks. During that time, there were concerns about disturbances to radioactive soil. Indeed, Ukrainian officials reported a spike in gamma radiation readings, likely because Russian military vehicles churned up contaminated dust in the Red Forest with their movements (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) assessed that the rise was localized and levels “remained low and near background levels” in areas where personnel were present (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).

(There were unconfirmed reports of some Russian soldiers later suffering radiation sickness.) Thankfully, despite the tense situation, no major structural damage occurred at Chernobyl’s containment facilities during the occupation. The plant’s power was cut for a time (raising concern about cooling of spent fuel storage), but backup systems and eventual reconnection prevented any incident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L174 The Chernobyl,on safety as a result" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20The%20Chernobyl,on%20safety%20as%20a%20result" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L195 The SNRIU,first time since 23 February" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L195%20The%20SNRIU,first%20time%20since%2023%20February" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). In late March 2022, Russian troops withdrew, and Ukrainian authorities regained control of the site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022 the Zaporizhzhia&nbsp;plant in southeastern" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022%20the%20Zaporizhzhia%C2%A0plant%20in%20southeastern" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). The episode highlighted that Chernobyl, while largely safe and stable, is still a sensitive site that needs protection. It also demonstrated the resilience of the New Safe Confinement and other systems – they withstood the human disruptions without releasing radiation.<br>Another very recent event was the February 2025 drone strike mentioned earlier. A drone (attributed to Russian forces amid the ongoing conflict) detonated on the roof of the NSC. It managed to puncture the outer and inner steel layers of the NSC’s roof in one spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This was a serious incident, but the redundancy of the NSC’s design meant that even with those holes, no radioactive dust escaped. The IAEA confirmed that radiation levels inside and outside the structure stayed normal (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_self">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). Repairs are presumably planned to maintain full integrity. This event underscores that while the radiological condition of Chernobyl is under control, human factors and security remain relevant to its safety.In summary, Chernobyl is not a ticking time bomb now, but a contained contaminated site. Current radiation levels in most areas pose minimal risk for brief exposures, and the worst areas are well-restricted. There is no fission or reaction occurring – the reactor fuel is inert and cooling for decades. The main ongoing safety focus is monitoring and managing the remaining radioactive materials to prevent any environmental release (especially during future fuel removal operations). With the new shelter and strong institutional oversight (even during conflict, international eyes like the IAEA are watching Chernobyl), the site’s condition is stable. It is safe enough for scientists, workers, and even tourists, provided regulations are followed, but it remains unsafe for normal habitation or unrestricted land use in the foreseeable future.The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is the officially designated area that surrounds the nuclear plant, from which routine habitation is excluded due to contamination. It was initially a 30 km radius circle, but over time it has been adjusted to cover the regions of highest fallout. Today, the CEZ in Ukraine spans roughly 2,600 km² (1,000 sq miles), an area nearly the size of Luxembourg. It is a mix of forest, marsh, and abandoned villages and towns. To the north, across the border, Belarus maintains its own 2,200 km² Polesie State Radiation-Ecological Reserve – effectively an extension of the Exclusion Zone. Combined, the whole Chernobyl affected zone is about 4,300–4,400 km² of mostly evacuated land. Within the Ukrainian CEZ, the borders are secured by patrols and checkpoints. One cannot simply wander in; access is controlled by the Chernobyl Zone Authority under Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.<br>The zone remains almost completely devoid of permanent residents. In the chaotic months after the disaster, some residents—especially older folks—were heartbroken at the thought of never returning to their homes. Despite official prohibition, a number of evacuees later snuck back into the Exclusion Zone and resettled in their old villages. These people are known as the “samosely” (self-settlers). Over the years, authorities generally tolerated their presence in small numbers. At their peak in the late 80s and early 90s, around 1,200 samosely lived in the zone; today (as of the 2010s), only an aging few dozen to a couple hundred remain, as many have passed away due to old age (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most%20of%20those" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). These residents live mostly in the outer parts of the zone, subsisting off gardens and pensions – they often say they’d rather face radiation in their beloved homes than live in alien cities. They do receive occasional visits from doctors and supplies, but for the most part they live simply and accept whatever risk exists. Their presence is a poignant human facet of the zone, though they are a tiny exception.For everyone else, the Exclusion Zone is a strictly controlled area. The infrastructure of the zone consists of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant industrial site (where a few thousand workers and security personnel commute for monitoring and projects, working in shifts but not living there), and the town of Chernobyl (about 15 km south of the reactor). The town of Chernobyl (not to be confused with the plant itself) actually still functions as an administrative center for the zone – a few hundred staff, scientists, and officers live there on rotations. It has dormitories, an operational canteen, and even two small hotels for visitors. However, this is not a “normal” town – it’s more like a base camp, since everyone there is on limited stay and monitored for radiation dose.The rest of the zone is characterized by abandoned settlements. Pripyat, once a model city of 50,000, remains empty and decaying – an urban time capsule of Soviet life in 1986. Dozens of villages similarly lie in ruins or are being reclaimed by vegetation. Over 200,000 hectares of the zone are wild land with no active human use. There are checkpoints at the 30 km and 10 km boundaries where dosimeters are used to check vehicles for contamination on exit.<br>Economically and administratively, the Exclusion Zone has been put to some new uses in recent years (covered under “Tourism and Development” below, like solar farms and scientific research). But its status is essentially that of a restricted environmental reserve. In 2016 Ukraine designated the Exclusion Zone as a national biosphere radiological reserve, recognizing its unique environment. There has even been discussion by Ukrainian officials of seeking UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Pripyat and Chernobyl’s cultural landscape, to preserve it as a memorial and scientific site. (In 2021, on the 35th anniversary, Ukraine formally started the process to nominate the CEZ as a World Heritage Site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible Unesco World Heritage Site" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible%20Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site" target="_self">Ukraine Seeks to Designate Chernobyl as a Unesco World Heritage ...</a>), though the war has interrupted these plans.)The security of the zone came under threat during the 2022 Russian invasion, as noted. For the first time, armed conflict intruded into the CEZ. During the Russian occupation, not only was there concern of accidental damage, but also reports of looting (even theft of radioactive lab samples) and disruption of wildfire management. Post-occupation, Ukraine has to demine parts of the zone due to mines left behind. The episode highlighted that the Exclusion Zone remains important strategically – it was a pathway for Russian forces towards Kyiv. After Russian withdrawal, Ukraine reasserted full control and the zone is back to being off-limits except for authorized personnel. The IAEA now has a permanent monitoring presence at Chernobyl as well.In conclusion, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone persists as a largely evacuated territory. It functions as a combination of a radiological reserve, an outdoor laboratory, a memorial landscape, and a buffer around the reactor site. With each passing year, the zone’s identity shifts more towards preservation and research. It stands as a remarkable example of how a large area, once meant for human habitation, has transformed following a technological disaster. Current conditions ensure that the zone will remain set apart for many years to come – a place where time stopped in 1986, now gradually being reclaimed by nature, and cautiously visited by those seeking to understand and remember Chernobyl’s lessons.One of the most intriguing aspects of Chernobyl today is its thriving wildlife and transformed ecosystem. As mentioned in the long-term effects section, the removal of humans has allowed many animal populations to rebound dramatically. The Exclusion Zone has effectively become a wildlife sanctuary – arguably one of the most unexpected nature preserves in the world.<br>Surveys and field research in the 2010s documented an abundance of large mammals. Wolves are considered the top predator in Chernobyl’s food chain now, and they range freely. A 2015 census using track counts and helicopter surveys found that Chernobyl’s wolf population was several times higher than in nearby non-contaminated reserves; prey like deer and wild boar were also plentiful (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The researchers reported “no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance” in the zone, noting that wildlife was doing well in the absence of people (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). This is not to say radiation has no effects, but any potential subtle effects have not prevented populations from growing. Another study published in 2015 in Current Biology concluded the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a “unique sanctuary for wildlife” with greater biodiversity than before the accident, due to human absence (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).Numerous species have returned to the area. For instance, the Eurasian lynx, absent in the region for decades due to hunting and habitat loss, now prowls the forests again. Brown bears have been observed moving through the zone (these had long been gone from this part of Ukraine). The European bison, an endangered species, was introduced to the Ukrainian zone in the 2010s and has since formed a small herd. Przewalski’s horses – critically endangered wild horses native to Central Asia – were released in the late 1990s as an experiment; they thrived and now about 100 of them roam the grasslands near Pripyat, grazing around abandoned villages. Elk (moose) populations are stable, and wild boar are so numerous that they spill out of the zone into surrounding farmland. Birdlife is rich as well: species like black storks, white-tailed eagles, eagle owls, and others are commonly seen. Even rare species like the globally threatened Greater Spotted Eagle have been recorded nesting in the zone. The wetlands in the Pripyat River floodplain inside the CEZ serve as important habitat for migratory birds. Lakes and ponds hold healthy fish populations (famously, the cooling pond of the plant has giant catfish that tourists love to watch – though their size is due to age and lack of fishing, not “mutations”).<br>Scientists continue to study these animals to see how chronic radiation exposure might be affecting them. Some findings are intriguing: for example, Chernobyl’s birds have been found to adapt by producing more anti-oxidants to counter radiation’s oxidative stress. A study on Chernobyl’s wolves has even tracked them leaving the zone, suggesting the zone might be a source of animals repopulating other areas (raising the question of whether they could carry mutations outward – though no evidence of any harmful spread has been observed). Another recent study (2023) on roundworms in the soil found that even after 1,000 generations in Chernobyl’s radionuclide-laden earth, the worms showed an ability to tolerate the radiation without significant genome damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the resurgence of a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the%20resurgence%20of%20a" target="_self">From disaster zone to living laboratory: Chernobyl provides test bed ...</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation,genomes of microscopic worms" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny%20Worms%20Tolerate%20Chornobyl%20Radiation,genomes%20of%20microscopic%20worms" target="_self">Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation - NYU</a>). This hints at potential resilience or repair mechanisms developed by life in the zone.That said, not every creature is thriving. Invertebrates and small mammals have shown mixed results in studies – some have reduced populations in high radiation sectors. Tree growth can be stunted in those areas. There have been reports of some partial “mutations” or anomalies: for instance, a higher frequency of albino barn swallows, or rodents with cataracts. But overall, the ecosystem functions: trees grow, leaves decompose (albeit slower at first), water bodies have oxygen and life, and a full trophic web (plants → herbivores → carnivores) is in place.The Exclusion Zone’s ecology has also benefited from deliberate protections. Since people aren’t farming or logging, forests have matured and expanded. In Belarus’s Polesie Reserve, there are large tracts of primeval-feeling forest that are home to lynx and wolves. Ukraine’s side set up the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve to coordinate ecological conservation and research.<br>Interestingly, the zone provides a case study on rewilding – showing how quickly wildlife can reclaim an area when humans leave. Within 5-10 years of the evacuation, animals from surrounding regions started moving in. Now, Chernobyl is cited as evidence that nature can be remarkably resilient. The United Nations Environment Programme noted that the land around Chernobyl has become “a haven for wildlife” in the absence of human activity (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers have found the land,become a haven for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20the%20land,become%20a%20haven%20for%20wildlife" target="_self">How Chernobyl has become an unexpected haven for wildlife - UNEP</a>). Some have even called it Europe’s own Serengeti (though that’s hyperbole; it is a rich temperate forest ecosystem, not a tropical savanna).It’s crucial to remember the wildlife success does not mean radiation is “good” for animals – rather, it underscores how damaging human habitation can be for wildlife, by comparison. Chernobyl removed the anthropogenic pressures (hunting, farming, pollution other than radiation), and wildlife moved in despite the radiation risk. The long-term genetic consequences for these animal populations are still being studied. But as of now, the biosphere of Chernobyl is vibrant. Visitors often report seeing tracks of wolves and boar everywhere, hearing bird songs in empty villages, or even catching sight of a wild horse galloping across the steppe. It’s a striking contrast: a site of human catastrophe has, over time, transformed into an “accidental wilderness.”<br>In summary, the current ecosystem in the Chernobyl area is a mixture of contamination and regeneration. Forests have overtaken former towns; animals roam where people once worked and played. The zone stands as a unique refuge for biodiversity in Eastern Europe, with higher wildlife abundance than before 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Ongoing research in this living laboratory will continue to inform us about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation on living organisms and about nature’s capacity for resilience after human departure.In recent years, Chernobyl has evolved into a destination for controlled tourism and a site for innovative projects aimed at finding some positive purpose for the Exclusion Zone. Disaster tourism, or “dark tourism,” has grown around Chernobyl, driven by curiosity, education, and the eerie allure of its post-apocalyptic landscape. At the same time, Ukraine has launched efforts to utilize the zone for renewable energy and scientific advancement, turning a place of tragedy into one of renewal.<br>Tourism: In 2011, Ukraine officially opened Chernobyl to tourism, recognizing the public interest and the zone’s educational value (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2011 Chernobyl was officially,tourist attraction%2C with many visitors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202011%20Chernobyl%20was%20officially,tourist%20attraction%2C%20with%20many%20visitors" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Since then, visiting Chernobyl has been possible via licensed tour operators. Tourists must apply in advance, submit their passport details (since it’s a secure area), and they enter on guided tours usually from Kyiv. These tours stick to relatively safe routes; visitors carry dosimeters and are briefed on safety (like not touching vegetation, not sitting on the ground, etc.). Typical tours include stops at the Chernobyl town (to see memorials and equipment graveyards), the Kopachi village ruins (where only a kindergarten building remains as a reminder), the Pripyat city (where one can carefully walk the deserted streets and see sites like the abandoned amusement park, swimming pool, and overgrown city square), and a distant view of the Reactor 4 complex and NSC from a safe distance. Some tours also visit the giant Duga-1 radar (“Russian Woodpecker”) – a huge abandoned Soviet radar installation in the zone. Tourists pass through radiation control gates when exiting to ensure they haven’t inadvertently picked up contamination (in practice, brief visitors rarely do).<br>Chernobyl tourism remained somewhat niche until the late 2010s when it saw a boom. The success of the 2019 HBO “Chernobyl” miniseries brought a surge of interest – tour agencies reported bookings jumping by 30-40% after the show aired (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One Chernobyl tour agency reported,which has attracted outstanding" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One%20Chernobyl%20tour%20agency%20reported,which%20has%20attracted%20outstanding" target="_self">HBO show success drives Chernobyl tourism boom - Reuters</a>). In 2018, roughly 70,000 tourists visited Chernobyl; in 2019, that number swelled to around 120,000 – 125,000 visitors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl sees a spike in,to the 70%2C000 in 2018" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/chernobyl-sees-a-spike-in-visitors-as-pop-culture-influences-tourism.html#:~:text=Chernobyl%20sees%20a%20spike%20in,to%20the%2070%2C000%20in%202018" target="_self">Chernobyl sees a spike in visitors as pop culture influences tourism</a>).

These visitors come from all over the world, drawn by historical interest, a taste for adventure, or even wildlife photography. The Ukrainian government even considered expanding tourist infrastructure given the demand.Tourism has had positive effects: it raises awareness of the disaster’s lessons and provides income (each visitor pays fees that support zone maintenance and local communities outside the zone). Guides emphasize that Chernobyl is a site of remembrance – there are memorials to firefighters and evacuees, and many tours include meeting an actual evacuee or a liquidator who can share their story. Visitors are often struck by the poignancy of places like Pripyat: an empty nursery with children’s toys still there, or murals peeling off school walls – snapshots of 1980s Soviet life frozen in time. This “open-air museum” aspect is why preservationists have pushed for UNESCO status, to protect it from decay and looting.Tourism was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again in 2022 because of the war. As of 2023, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tourist access is suspended for security reasons. But prior to that, Chernobyl had firmly established itself as a tourist destination, and it likely will again when conditions normalize. It’s not a Disneyfied experience – the trips are somber and heavily managed – but it provides a powerful insight into nuclear history and its consequences.Restoration and Development Projects: While the land will be unsafe for farming or regular habitation for a long time, Ukraine has sought creative ways to utilize the Exclusion Zone. One idea has been to turn it into a hub for renewable energy. The reasoning: the zone has abundant land that cannot be used for agriculture, and it has existing high-voltage power lines (from when the plant generated electricity) that connect to the grid. So, why not install solar panels or wind turbines there?<br>In 2018, the first project materialized – a 1 megawatt solar power plant was built within sight of the old reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The new one,first years of its operation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The%20new%20one,first%20years%20of%20its%20operation" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Installed by a Ukrainian-German company, this solar farm consists of about 3,800 photovoltaic panels on a 1.6 hectare plot, right near the Chernobyl plant. It was connected to the grid and, symbolically, began generating power again at Chernobyl (the first electricity from the site since the last reactor shut down in 2000) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It is the first time,would never produce energy again" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20first%20time,would%20never%20produce%20energy%20again" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). This small solar station powers about 2,000 homes, and plans were floated for expansion. The Ukrainian government has actively promoted the Exclusion Zone as a site for renewable energy projects, pitching that up to 2.5 GW of solar capacity could eventually be installed (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Interest was shown by companies from China, France, and other countries in building solar farms in the late 2010s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). The cheap land (effectively free, since it’s unusable for other purposes) and existing transmission lines make it economically attractive – with the caveat that construction workers can only spend limited hours in the area for safety (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two years ago%2C a giant,reactor to be dismantled safely" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20giant,reactor%20to%20be%20dismantled%20safely" target="_self">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).<br>Similarly, in 2021 Ukraine announced plans for a large wind farm in the Exclusion Zone. In partnership with a European company, they envision up to 1 GW of wind energy capacity to be developed in the zone (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear option%3A Ukraine plans one,around the Chernobyl nuclear plant" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear%20option%3A%20Ukraine%20plans%20one,around%20the%20Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant" target="_self">Nuclear option: Ukraine plans one of Europe's largest wind farms in ...</a>). If realized, that would make it one of Europe’s biggest onshore wind farms. Such a project would further transform Chernobyl from a symbol of nuclear disaster into a contributor to clean energy production (without the risks of nuclear). As of the latest updates, these plans are on hold due to the war, but Ukraine has indicated strong interest in resuming them once it’s safe.Besides energy, the zone is used for scientific research and environmental monitoring. Ecologists, biologists, and radiologists from around the world work in the CEZ to study radiation effects on nature, remediation techniques, and even astrophysics (the low light pollution makes it good for certain telescopic observations). There have been projects to test robotic equipment for radiation mapping, to experiment with phytoremediation (using plants to extract radionuclides from soil), and to monitor wildfires via satellites. The zone’s administration also employs people in forestry (they actively manage some forests to reduce fire risk, by removing dry fuel). Some contaminated wood is harvested under careful conditions and used as biomass fuel in special power plants (with filtration) outside the zone – a bit controversial, but an attempt to utilize resources while controlling pollution.One notable “restoration” in a cultural sense is the preservation of certain buildings. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself still has workers doing decommissioning. Tours can visit the control room of Reactor 4 now (in full gear, for a short 5-minute look) – it was opened to very limited visiting in 2019 as part of raising awareness. The control room is, of course, contaminated and everything inside remains as it was after the accident (now with higher radiation levels), so such visits are symbolic. There is also the Chernobyl Museum in Kiev (Kyiv) which is outside the zone but dedicated to its history.One can’t mention restoration without noting that Chernobyl will never be “restored” to its pre-1986 state in the literal sense. The goal is more about containment and adaptation. The current strategy (per international plans) is to keep the reactor area safe and start removing the fuel debris between now and 2065, package the waste, and then possibly begin to dismantle the NSC and other structures after that. Meanwhile, large parts of the Exclusion Zone may be left to nature indefinitely. Some areas with lower contamination could potentially be opened for limited use sooner – for example, a few outer villages were reclassified in the 2010s to allow former residents to visit or even live with some restrictions (particularly in parts of Belarus). But for the most contaminated core zones, the “no man’s land” will persist for many generations – essentially as a wildlife reserve and historical monument.Latest updates (as of early 2025): The war in Ukraine has introduced uncertainties – for instance, the renewable projects are paused, and the zone occasionally faces security issues. But the NSC and other safety systems are functioning. Ukraine’s government remains committed to integrating the zone into its future plans (President Zelensky in 2020 declared Chernobyl a place of “special importance” that should be turned from a negative into a positive symbol). There’s talk of developing better infrastructure for tourists and researchers once it’s feasible.Chernobyl has also become part of global pop culture and education. Documentaries and movies abound. The site draws not only tourists but also journalists, scientists, and even video game designers (the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is set in a fictionalized Chernobyl zone). This human engagement with Chernobyl today is part of its ongoing story – ensuring that the lessons of 1986 are not forgotten and that maybe something constructive can arise from the tragedy.<br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was a cataclysmic event with causes rooted in design flaws and human error, producing immediate devastation to human life and the environment. Its immediate consequences included loss of life, widespread radioactive contamination, and political upheaval. Over the long term, it has had complex health outcomes (notably thousands of thyroid cancers, but surprisingly limited other health impacts according to UNSCEAR) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), and it left a profound mark on ecology – decimating some aspects of the environment while inadvertently creating a wildlife haven. The disaster also influenced geopolitical currents, hastening the Soviet Union’s end and reshaping global nuclear policy.Cleanup efforts were unprecedented in scale – from the half-million liquidators who risked their health, to the massive engineering feats of containment with the sarcophagus and New Safe Confinement. Today, Chernobyl stands in a state of stable containment: radiation is largely confined, Reactor 4 is entombed under the new arch, and the area is under constant monitoring. The surrounding Exclusion Zone has transformed into a unique sanctuary for biodiversity and a living museum of the anthropocene. Current radiation levels in most of the zone are low enough to allow visits, although the land will not be fully “clear” for normal life for centuries in the most affected parts.<br>Chernobyl’s story is still unfolding – it’s a story of warning about the dangers of nuclear power without proper safety, but also a story of resilience (of people and nature). Efforts continue in making the site useful – whether generating solar electricity or providing invaluable scientific data on radiation’s effects. As of today, Chernobyl is both a monument to a past disaster and a dynamic environment of recovery. It remains a sobering reminder of the costs of human error, and a testament to international cooperation in mitigating a disaster’s aftermath. The legacy of Chernobyl is reflected in safer nuclear industry practices (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_self">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), in the lives of survivors and evacuees, and in the lush forests where wolves now howl in a zone once poisoned by fallout.The name “Chernobyl” will forever conjure images of catastrophe, but it also stands for the knowledge gained at great cost and the enduring hope that even the worst environments can find a form of healing over time.Sources:

'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .2 (weak)
r = ± .4 (moderate)
r = ± .8 (strong)
It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .1 (weak)
r = ± .3 (moderate)
r = ± .5 (strong) R-squared = .448 in the example above. 44.8% of the variation in kid's scores on the cognitive test is accounted for by their mother's IQ. Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts:
- What we can explain by the model (regression)
- What we still cannot explain (error)<br>
<a data-href="Mediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mediation</a> Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV?
Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)! H0: β1 = 0
H1: β1 ≠ 0
H0: y-hat = y-bar
H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
H1: ρ &gt; 0
H0: ρ2 = 0
H1: ρ2 &gt; 0 Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2) Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2) Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α

The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.

In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png" target="_self">

The capacity to maintain one's own identity (thoughts, values, and beliefs) while remaining emotionally connected to others. <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> introduced this concept to explain how individuals manage anxiety and stress by separating thinking from emotional reactivity. Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. Example. An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. Example. An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. Example. A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. Clinical implication Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/final-project/project-outline.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/Final Project/Project Outline.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:33:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Struggling Students]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/family-development-(2200)/struggling-students.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Family Development (2200)/Struggling Students.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:46:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Family Development (2200)]]></title><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/family-development-(2200)/family-development-(2200).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Family Development (2200)/Family Development (2200).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:46:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Assignment 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[This classwork/homework assignment is a multiple imputation activity. You will continue to use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2011 Cohort.&nbsp;The classwork/homework write-up is due by Tuesday at 11:59PM (3/18).&nbsp;The data you need come from two sources. The first is the data file you have been working on for class activities the last several week. The second is located in this week's folder. A researcher wants to know whether maternal depressive symptoms are associated with children’s early learning and development. But before the researcher can address this question, you are asked to think about and address missing data. The researcher has provided you with several variables in addition to the variables you have worked with thus far:
You are asked to include an overall composite of depressive symptoms. The research provides you with 12 items that you are asked to composite (P2BOTHER P2APPETI P2BLUE P2KPMIND P2DEPRES P2EFFORT P2FEARFL P2RESTLS P2TALKLS P2LONELY P2SAD P2NOTGO).
You will also include three child variables: a) a variable capturing children’s academic achievement, b) a variable capturing children’s socioemotional skills, and c) a variable capturing children’s executive functioning. For the academic achievement measure, you will need to create a new composite variable that is composed of reading, math, and science (X2RSCALK4 X2MSCALK4 X2SSCALK4). For socioemotional skills, you will need to create a new variable that is the average of teacher reports of self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior (i.e.,&nbsp;X2TCHINT X2TCHEXT X2TCHCON X2TCHPER). Children’s executive functioning skills are captured with a single item:&nbsp;X2DCCSTOT.
The researcher also wants you to include covariates/indicators for race/ethnicity (X_RACETH_R), child sex (X_CHSEX_R), income (X2INCCAT_I), parents’ marital status (P1CURMAR), parents physical health (P2HEALTH), household members under 18 (X1LESS18), and household members over 18 (X1OVER18) .
With that in mind...Step 1: You need to merge the new data into the dataset you have been working with. This requires a 1 to 1 merge using CHILDID. This step will be graded via your do/log files (.25 points)Step 2: Once the data are merged, examine your data. Orient yourself to the old and new variables (e.g., are they continuous, categorical etc etc) and&nbsp;recode&nbsp;any new variables as appropriate. Recall how Stata recognizes missing data. Please also&nbsp;create&nbsp;the appropriate composites&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to imputation. The composites will be what you will use in your imputation.&nbsp;If you recode other variables, please provide a justification. This step will be graded via your do/log files and your justification in your word document. (.25 points) Step 3: Once you have cleaned your data,&nbsp;run&nbsp;some descriptives for all of your variables (including your covariates) and determine the degree of missing values for each variable. Please also estimate a correlation matrix for your focal independent and dependent variables (do&nbsp;not&nbsp;include the list of covariates for your correlation matrix). What &nbsp;patterns you notice from the descriptive statistics? How much missing data are there for the variables? What patterns do you notice from the correlation matrix? (1.00 point) Step 4:&nbsp;Determine&nbsp;whether data are MCAR. Examine and discuss the missing data patterns. Are there common patterns of missing data? Are there uncommon patterns of missing data? Anything you notice worth discussing? If data are not MCAR, discuss whether the data may meet assumptions of MAR or MNAR. Why or why not? If you have any concerns proceeding to imputation, discuss it here. (1.25 points) Step 5:&nbsp;Run&nbsp;an imputation model with 10 datasets. Make sure you specify each variable correctly. And remember to&nbsp;upload&nbsp;your do and log files (for the entire assignment). This step will be graded via your do file (1.00 point) Step 6: After you have run your imputation,&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;descriptives&nbsp;within&nbsp;the 10 imputed datasets. You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to do this for every variable. Run these descriptives for the focal variables of interest (depressive symptoms, children's academic achievement, social skills, and executive functioning). Use the mi xeq command (e.g., mi xeq: sum XYZ). Discuss what you notice about the means/SDs across the imputations. (1.00 point)Step 7.&nbsp;Estimate&nbsp;correlations (use mi xeq: corr) among your focal variables from step 1, but this time&nbsp;within&nbsp;your 10 datasets. Are there any similarities between the imputed and non-imputed data? Are there any other differences you notice? (.75 points) Step 8. Upload your word document, log file, and do file. Please upload stata versions of your log/do files (not copied/pasted into word).]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Assignment 4.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:51:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mediation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mediation" data-href="Mediation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Single Mediation</a><br>

Mediation examines how the effect of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) is transmitted through a third variable, called the mediator (M). In simple mediation, there is one mediator. To determine if the IV influences the DV directly and/or indirectly via the mediator. The model splits the total effect into The portion of the effect of IV on DV that is not explained by the mediator. The portion of the effect that is transmitted from IV to DV through the mediator. Relationships among IV, mediator, and DV are linear. Scatterplots: Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot and plot DV vs. IV and DV vs. M. Look for a straight-line pattern. Residuals vs. Predicted Plot: Run Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear…; click Plots… to assign standardized predicted values (X-axis) and standardized residuals (Y-axis).
Criteria: No systematic pattern (i.e., randomness, with any curve test yielding p &gt; .05). Residuals have constant variance across all levels of predictors. Examine the same residuals vs. predicted plot for an even spread (no funnel shape). Residuals are approximately normally distributed. Create histograms and Q–Q plots using Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram or Q–Q plot options. Criteria: Skewness values less than |2.0| and kurtosis values less than |7.0|; Q–Q plot points should lie near the diagonal line. Observations are independent. Confirm via your study design.
Review the Durbin–Watson statistic from your regression output (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable). There are no unmeasured variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and DV. This is primarily a design issue; however, consider including control variables if needed. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX by Andrew Hayes
Choose Model 4 (designed for simple mediation).
Set the DV, IV, and mediator in the appropriate boxes.
Enable bootstrapping (commonly set to 5,000 samples) to obtain robust confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effect.
Click OK. Direct Path (IV → M): Example: a = 0.40, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path from Mediator to DV (M → DV, controlling for IV): Example: b = 0.50, SE = 0.12, p = .002 Indirect Effect (a × b): Example: 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.200.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.08, 0.35] (does not include zero → significant mediation). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for M):
Example: c′ = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005
Total Effect (IV → DV without mediator):
Example: c = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001 A mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to examine whether [Mediator] mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The total effect of [IV] on [DV] was significant (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001). When [Mediator] was entered into the model, the direct effect decreased (b = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005). The indirect effect was significant (b = 0.20, SE = 0.07, 95% CI [0.08, 0.35]), indicating that [Mediator] partially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator(s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV → Mediator 1 → DV IV → Mediator 2 → DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. each mediator.
Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a1 = 0.30, b1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a2 = 0.25, b2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.” Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. predicted plots for each link: IV → M1, M1 → M2, and M2 → DV.
Use histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M1 influences M2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M2 on M1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
Click Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV → Mediator 1: Example: a1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M1):
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
Sequential Indirect Effect (IV → M1 → M2 → DV):
Calculation: a1 × d × b2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):
Example: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation. Check Assumptions in SPSS: Generate scatterplots, residual vs. predicted plots, histograms, and Q–Q plots.
Verify diagnostic values: skewness (&lt; |2.0|), kurtosis (&lt; |7.0|), Durbin–Watson (1.5–2.5), and inter-mediator correlations (r &lt; 0.80 for parallel mediation).
For serial mediation, confirm intermediate regression steps are significant (p &lt; .05). Conduct Mediation Analysis with PROCESS: Use the appropriate model: Model 4 for simple and parallel mediation; Model 6 for serial mediation.
Enter variables as specified and enable bootstrapping (commonly 5,000 samples) to generate 95% confidence intervals. Interpret Output: Evaluate p-values for each path (significant if p &lt; .05).
For indirect effects, confirm that bootstrapped confidence intervals do not include zero. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/mediation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/Mediation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 21:32:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[7. Sampling & Complex Designs]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Why should we strive for population representative sampling? Important for policy or practice. We do not want to recommend changes that are not based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact. How? Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)
Work on large teams
Use secondary data Normally used to compensate for over- and under-sampling of individuals
Example It is common to over-sample minority groups... If we doubled the size of our minority sample, then each minority case would get a design weight of 1/2 or .5. We use the design weight when we want the statistics to be representative of the population. Used to compensate for the fact that persons with certain characteristics are not as likely to respond to the survey. Example Most population surveys have substantially more female than male respondents; because surveys over-represents females and under-represents males in the population, a weight is used to compensate for this bias. There are many responsent characteristics that are likely to be related to the propensity to respond such as age, education, race/ethnicity, place of residence. Dataset with cases Simple mean (4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 2.8 Weighted mean {(4 1) + (2 2) + (1 4) + (5 1) + (2 * 2)} / 10 = 2.1 With unweighted data, each case is counted equally
With weighted data, each case is counted relative to its representation in the population
Unweighted data represent only those in the sample who provide data
Weights allow analyses that represent the target population
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs.png" target="_self"> Most STATA commands can deal with weighted data, where the weight is a variable in the dataset. You need to specify the type of weight and the weight variable, using brackets at the end of your command, as in:
summarize x [weight=weightvarname]
tab x [weight=weightvarname]
regress y x [weight=weightvarname]
There are 4 types of weights in STATA, but for most data analyses you will use one of the following: Probability pweights, for observations sampled with unequal probability of selection. Use this for inferential analyses.
Analytic aweights, for data containing averages where the average is weighted by the # obs used in calculating the average…. Use this for your descriptive statistics. <br><img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-1.png" target="_self">
Different studies create different types of weights... Some data create weights depending on: Level of analysis (child, teacher, or school)
Type of analysis (cross-sectional vs. Longitudinal)
Source of data (child assessment, parent interview, teacher questionnaires, etc.)
For example, the ECLS-K has ~ 105 different options Many suggest you use combination weights when estimating longitudinal analyses because they assume that these users will not adjust for attrition on their own. I suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights. Instead, use modern missing data procedures for attrition bias, and use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias I make this recommendation because attrition weights have two key disadvantages Attrition weights often reduce the analytical sample size, and thereby, statistical power. If many non-model variables related to missing data are incorporated, missing data techniques adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights Use weights whenever possible, but some methods do not allow weights
Steps to follow to avoid vias in unweighted analyses <br>Include as <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> that might account for the sample design or non-response
<br>If a weight is available, it can also be included as an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a>
If the weight is associated with the outcom ein a model including the design variables, then the weight is likely to have been constructed in a way related to your outcome; bias is possile. E.g., some multilevel models, some structural equation programs, etc. National samples are first divided into primary sampling units... What these units are depends on the study.
- E.g., in many data of the US the PSUs are geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-2.png" target="_self"> After identifying PSUs, then PSUs are stratified into groups. These groups are formed to keep similar units together... How many and what types of strata are determined by study goals.<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-3.png" target="_self">
Then within each strata, and within PSUs, you sample Software can make the adjustment... A few different approaches with the easiest being the Taylor Series approach Use primary sampling unit (PSU) and strata variables in the data file. The strata and PSU identifiers are often associated with a specific sampling weight variable. For example, in the ECLS-K the weight C1CW0 has the following strata and PSU: C1TVWSTR and C1TCWPSU svyset PSU [pweight = WEIGHT], strata(STRATA)
Then use svy: before your subsequent commands (e.g., svy: tab or svy: mean or svy: regress)
svy: will NOT work with all commands
svy: mean and mean [weight = weight] yield the same mean estimates… it is the SEs that are different)<br>

<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-5.png" target="_self"> Weights should be used when analyzing data from national samples; otherwise, you cannot make claims about representativeness
The appropriate weight should be selected based on: Level of analysis
Round (s) of data
Source (s) of data There may not be a 'perfect' weight for many analyses
All statistical tests should be based on standard errors that account for complex sample design

Conditioning on such risk factors is necessary to remove bias. Do NOT use p-values to determine covariate inclusion. Use a priori theory!

Variable Selection &amp; Data Relationships-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/6.-variable-selection-&amp;-data-relationships-2.png" target="_self"> As you are making decisions regarding your variables, consider the following questions: How will constructs be operationalized?
What items will be used and which measures are critical to the tests?
If multiple measures are available, what will be done? These issues often require quite a bit of conceptual considerations and defending in the peer-review process. In big datasets, measures are often abbreviated. Measurement problems arise when The concept to be measured are vague or poorly defined
Indicators are imperfect measures of the underlying construct
Individual responses are inaccurate (e.g., distraction, illness, poor comprehension)
Errors lead to erroneous values Accuracy The closeness of the measurement to the true value Bias A systematic variation of measurements from the quality being measured Precision The closeness of repeated measurements to one another <br><img alt="6.

The vast majority of constructs require more than one item, Why? Low content validity (sensitivity and reliability) The primary objective of creating a series of composite scales is to avoid the exclusive use of, or dependence on, single item constructs where possible. The use of several variables as indicators provides an opportunity to represent differing facets of a given concept, with the aim of yielding a more well-rounded perspective and, arguably, a better measure.

Why do we test for reliability in subpopulations? Establish the psychometric properties of a new or existing measure/assessment tool Means for determining generalizeability
Are we measuring the same construct in the same way across groups or across time? Increase confidence that observed differences between groups reflect true differences and not those ties to measurement. Reliability within subgroups is often assumed but rarely tested and is a big issue for many datasets that do not use previously validated meaures. Why use existing composites? Data availability: you often may not have all necessary data to create the composite
Reproducibility: everyone uses the same construct
Convenience: time and effort spent on identifying possible composites and determining best source of information to creating them But first, always read the user's guide and when item level data are available, check yourself!

Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. Predicted plots for each link: IV → M 1, M 1 → M 2, and M 2 → DV.
Use histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M 1 influences M 2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M 2 on M 1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
Click Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV → Mediator 1: Example: a 1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M 1):
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
Sequential Indirect Effect (IV → M 1 → M 2 → DV):
Calculation: a 1 × d × b 2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):
Example: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation.

Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator (s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV → Mediator 1 → DV IV → Mediator 2 → DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. Each mediator.
Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. Predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a 1 = 0.30, b 1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a 2 = 0.25, b 2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.”

<br>(NB: only do this when your moderator is a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> variable)
This is done to help with interpretation Moments=0 Omitting it from the syntax means we are creating three categories of the moderator by using the 16th percentile, 50th percentile, and the 84th percentile. This is the default. If your moderator is a categorical with more than 2 categories, you can add /MCW=1 to the syntax to automatically create dummy variables for you.

This first part of the output shows us the model we built including the model number, our N, and the model summary. Model summary includes the R2 value, which in this case shows a significant amount of variance explained (37.63%) Below, in the 'Model' table, you can see the coefficients for the intercept as well as for the slopes of Dose, Love of Puppies, and the automatically created interaction term. Just below that you see that the interaction term is dose x puppylove<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-15.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-15.png" target="_self"> This next significant table shows us the conditional effects of W at the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentiles. Here, we see that when puppy love is at the 16 th percentile (puppy love = 1), the effect is 1.81 (p = .0013). Likewise, when puppy love is at the 50 th percentile (2.5), the effect is also significant (p = .0046) at 1.1694. However, the effect is no longer significant at the 84 th percentile for puppy love, (p &gt; .05).<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-16.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-16.png" target="_self"> The next table is the Johnson-Newman results. The Johnson-Newman approach looks for the values of W, where the p-values of the conditional effect changes to above/below the chosen significance level (. 05). So, it looks for the values of W that cause t-crit value to equal zero for when determining the conditional effect of X, where the p-value is exactly the alpha, or .05 in most cases. At what values of W, do the results go from significant to non-significant, or vice-versa, in terms of conditional effect?
Your results can either be of one, two, or zero values. If there is one value, that means there is only one value of W where the conditional effect either becomes significant or loses significance. If there are two values, that means there are two points at which W will change in significance. This will either mean the middle range is significant, but not the high and low values of W, or that the high and low values of W are significant, but not the middle range. The middle range is determined by the W values themselves. If there are no values, then the conditional effect is either always significant or never significant for all values of W. Next are graphical representations for what different types of Johnson-Newman results may look like. Where the line cross .05, that's where this approach looks for the value of W, giving us more insight into what extent our moderator... Well, moderates.<br>

See that the Johnson-Newman technique gave us only one value, 3.3364. By finding the value in the table below, we can see that the conditional effect is significant before W = 3.3364, but non-significant after that point. So, it is significant with lower levels of puppy love. (First column, row 3.3364)<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-20.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-20.png" target="_self"> The moderator (puplove) has significant impact on the relationship between time spent with Puppies and Happiness, only at its low values (i.e., from 0.00 to 3.3364) This implies that, the less an individual loves a puppy, the more time spent with puppy affect (increases) their happiness. At its higher values, the moderator (puplove) does not have a significant effect on the relationship between time spent with Puppies (focal predictor) and Happiness (outcome variable) This implies that, increasing the time spent with Puppy does not affect/change (increases) happiness for individuals who already love Puppies. The next part of the table give us the syntax to generate the plot<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-21.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-21.png" target="_self">
Double click on the matrix table and it will allow you to highlight and copy parts of the text. Highlight and copy from the DATA LIST FREE/ until the period at the end. Once you copy the code, paste it into a new syntax file. There is nothing you need to change. Just highlight and play the syntax. The results will look like the graph below, a plot with points but no lines.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-22.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-22.png" target="_self"> To create plot lines, double click on the plot itself. A 'Chart Editor' pop-up will appear.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-23.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-23.png" target="_self">
Click on the Add lines at Subgroups button (It looks like a scatterplots with TWO lines through it, not one) (circled in red)
You will get the properties pop-up now, but by default, it will give you the lines you need, as you can see now in the red boxed area. Just close the properties box and the chart editor box.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-24.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-24.png" target="_self">
This is what your chart should look like now. You can now have lines that can help you to visualize the changes in X vs. Y, given the subgroups of W. Pretend that literature shows that the more someone loves puppies, the happier they are. We would like to test that theory, but with a moderator of time spent with puppies during a trial (dose).
Here, we are recognizing that Dose is a multi-categorical variable for control group (0 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes with puppies).
Typically, we would need to dummy-code these variables, but PROCESS does it for you, provided you remember one extra step. First, set up the model as usual in PROCESS. Note. Where the variables are in the image based on the new hypothesis. Next click on 'Multicategorical'<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-25.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-25.png" target="_self">
The next pop-up you will get is the multicategorical box. Here, you will select the checkbox under 'Variable W' to indicate that your moderator is multicategorical. Note. The other options, indicating that you can also do this for any X or Z variables(s) that have 3 or more categories. Click Continue.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-26.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-26.png" target="_self">
Click OK. One of the changes is the dummy coding. The coding scheme is provided just below the model overview and will look something like the table below.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-27.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-27.png" target="_self">
The next change is the model and product terms key tables. Just keep in mind the W coding scheme from before when interpreting each line, since now we are recognizing the separate levels of our W.
The final change is the set-up of the conditional effects table. Usually, this will either be representative of the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentile (default), or the means +/- 1 SD (if selected). However, now since we are recognizing W as a categorical variable, the doses are listed as the separate categories.
- Note how there is no mention of the percentiles in the 'Analysis Notes and Errors' section.<br>

Mathematically accounting for the influence of another parameter on the relation between x and y.
When predictors are correlated, they potentially have shared or overlapping explained variance in Y. We need to consider the unique contribution of each.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) does NOT do this. Squaring an r statistic is only useful when there is only one predictor (R-squared)
Unique correlations are needed to account for multiple predictors: Partial (first-order) Correlation

You can save residuals as their own variables to detect multivariate outliers. Predicted values tell you what SPSS thinks the y value should be based on the x-values of the case. Residual values are how far off SPSS was
Mahalanobis distance tells you how far away a case is from the 'cloud' of other values.

Where the action is. Each row conveys information about the regression equation that SPSS produced as the 'best fitting' model.
Unstandardized coefficients are easier to interpret, but standardized coefficients are more useful for including in manuscripts (apples to apples instead of apples to oranges)
Significance level of .05 is standard, though more stringent p-values can be employed to address weaknesses in design. Zero-order correlations represent the standard correlation between each x and y
Partial and part correlations should be squared manually prior to interpretation. Squared partial correlation represents the variance remaining in y after factoring out the x variable. Squared part (semi-partial) correlation represents the unique variance explained in y by the x variable. Tolerance reflects the proportion of the variance in x that is not predictable from other x predictor variables. 0-1 with zero meaning no new contribution and one meaning completely uncorrelated with the other predictors. <br>VIF indicates the degree of similarity between an x variable and at least one other x variable in the model.

The variable must be 'dummy coded.'
Think of dummy coding as light switches. 1 ('on') means group membership and 0 ('off') means no group membership. Dummy coding means giving every case k-1 variables that indicate group membership.
For the school variable So, someone from Cline elementary would have the following values for group membership: AEC = 0, Campbell County High = 0, Campbell County MS = 0, Campbell County Elementary = 0, Cline = 1, Crossroads = 0, Grants Lick = 0, Reiley = 0 k-1 groups are used to fully capture group membership. A 'reference' category is selected to represent group membership when all values are zero. Typically, the reference category is the most often selected category. For example, Campbell County High School has roughly 49% of the data in our sample dataset, meaning that category should be selected as the referent. Coefficients are interpreted as the mean differences between the reference category and the category in question. <br><img alt="2.

Sometime, interpreting the intercept becomes difficult or meaningless, especially when we are dealing with variables like IQ, SAT scores, etc.
We have to use what is termed as 'mean-centering' That is creating a new variable by simply subtracting the mean from each individual observation
E.g., Centered IQi = IQi - IQ-bar (mean of IQ scores) ** Centering mom_iq.
** Note that the mean for mom's IQ is 100
COMPUTE iq_c = mom_iq - 100

Potentially biased or inaccurate findings
Delays or rejections of manuscripts with faulty analyses included But assumptions are easily (and often) violated. Correct when you can and be transparent when you cannot. Do not let assumption violations alone preclude your use of a statistical technique. Variables must be linearly related to each other

1 - CDF.CHSQ(MAH_1,2) Degrees of freedom is 2 because we have two predictors According to Tabachnick &amp; Fidell (2013), the recommended threshold p-value is .001. So, cases with p-values less than .001 indicates significant outliers on the predictors.<br>

The minimum p-value in this example is .02 which is greater than the threshold value (i.e., .001), so we can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictors.<br>
<img alt="4. Diagnostics and Psychometrics-9.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics-9.png" target="_self">
The scatterplot shows an inverse relationship between Mahal Distance and the associated p-values. So, if the p-value of the maximum Mahal distance (Check the 'Residual Statistics Table') is greater than the threshold of .001, you can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictor(s).
You do not even have to check the Mahal distance for individual cases. The absolute values of DfFITS (i.e., |SDF_1|) tells us the magnitude of the effect an individual case have on the predicted values. This indicates that, the SDF_1, similar to the Cook's distance, help examine the influence of some cases on the predicted values. Cases with absolute values of DfFITS greater than 2 (i.e., |SDF_1| &gt; 2) should be examined. <br><img alt="4.

<br><img alt="4. Diagnostics and Psychometrics-11.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics-11.png" target="_self">
Since the maximum absolute value is .33205, which is not greater than 2, we can conclude that there is no issue with an influential outlier(s). Helps examine whether a case is influential on the intercept or the slopes. The case should first be considered influential by looking at the D and/or the DfFITS. A case with an DfBeta greater than 2 can be said to have greater influence on the regression parameter in question (Pituch &amp; Stevens, 2016). This case then has to be investigated.<br>
<img alt="4. Diagnostics and Psychometrics-12.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics-12.png" target="_self">
In our example
- SDB0_1 represents the DFBETA for the intercept
- SDB 1_1 represents the DFBETA for the mom's IQ
- SDB 2_1 represents the DFBETA for the mom age<br>
<img alt="4. Diagnostics and Psychometrics-13.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics-13.png" target="_self">
The maximum absolute DFBETA (i.e., |DFBETA|) value for all the regression parameters (i.e., the intercept and the slopes) are less than 2, hence we can conclude that none of the cases have relatively high influence on our regression parameters. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/in-class-content/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/In-Class Content/4.

The change in the dependent (outcome) variable for a one unit change in the independent (predictor) variable, while holding all other variables constant.
Expressed in the original units of the dependent (outcome) and independent (predictor) variables. The values obtained after standardizing all variables (both dependent and independent variables) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
This allows for the newly calculated variables to represent the change in the dependent variable (in standard deviations) for one-standard deviation change in the value of the independent variable. Measures the relationship between two variables without controlling for any other variable(s) using simple correlation.
We would use this when we want to understand the simple bivariate relationship between two variables.
We would likely use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient R for this type of analysis. Measures the correlation between x and y while controlling for x2 (on both x and y).
We would likely use this when we want to understand the direct relationship between two variables, independent of influence of other variables. Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of one or more variables on only one of the two variables.
Correlation between x and y while controlling for x2 (on x1 only)
We would likely use this when we want to understand the exact contribution of an independent (predictor) variable to the dependent (outcome) variable, after taking into account the influence of other variables on the independent (predictor) variable. All predictors are added into the regression model at the same time.
The model evaluates the contribution of each predictor to the outcome variable while controlling for all other predictors.
R-squared is a static value that represents the variance explained in the outcome variable by the collective set of predictors.
<a data-href="Continuous variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous variable</a> is added as it is
<br><a data-href="Nominal Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/nominal-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nominal Variable</a> must be dummy coded
Variables with non-zero values should be ‘centered’ Predictors are entered into the model in a pre-specified order based theory-driven blocks.
The model is built in blocks (steps) with each block adding one or more predictors. The change in the model’s R-squared is assessed at every step. A series of multiple-regression are performed, with each block being added to the next until all variables are included in the model.
The final block of hierarchical multiple regression = simultaneous multiple regression. Very useful to look at the change in R-squared for each variable or blocks of variables Allow for testing hypotheses in the order of importance/priority of predictors. Squared semi-partial correlation provides the unique variance explained by a given variable. Predictors are added/removed from the model based on statistical criteria such as p-values or R-squared change rather than being theory-driven. Predictors are added/removed in data-driven blocks.
Mathematically derives the highest R-squared value with the least number of predictors.
CAUTION: NEVER USE THIS METHOD UNLESS STUDY IS ABSOLUTELY EXPLORATORY. Most predictive variables are added first Least predictive variables are removed first When you square the semi-partial correlation, it yields the proportion of the variance of y uniquely explained by x while controlling for all other predictors. Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear
Move dependent variable to Dependent. Move independent variable(s) to the Independent(s).
- In Statistics, select Estimates (under Regression Coefficients), Model Fit, Descriptives, and Durbin-Watson (under Residuals, independence of errors). Click Continue.
- In Plots, select Histograms and Normal Probability Plot (under Standardized Residual Plots). Move ZPRED under Y. Move ZRESID to X. Click Continue.
- In Save, select Cook’s (under Distances). Click Continue.
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK. The relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (outcome) variables is linear.
How to Check Use Scatterplots to visualize relationships. Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot.
Click Simple Scatter. Click Define.
Move your dependent variable (outcome) to the Y-Axis. Move your independent variable (predictor) to the X-Axis.
If the scatterplot is approximately linear, the assumption is met. If not linear, apply transformation. Observations are independent of each other (no autocorrelation, where observations are NOT independent)
How to Check Use the Durbin-Watson test by clicking the option under Linear Regression: Statistics.
If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 – 2.5, the assumption is met. <br>If data is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Autocorrelation" data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">autocorrelated</a>, use alternative models such as the generalized least squares (GLS) model. The residuals (errors) have constant variance across all levels of independent variable(s).
How to Check Plot residuals vs. predicted values and look for a random scatter.
In SPSS, request Linear Regression Plots. Move Y &gt; ZPRED. Move X &gt; ZRESID. If the scatterplots shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met.
If assumption is violated, you can transform the dependent variable, use standard errors, or apply weighted least squares (WLS). The residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
How to Check (For None or One Grouping Variable) Click Analyze &gt; Descriptives &gt; Explore
Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box.
Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected.
Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. Click Continue.
Click OK.
Check Shapiro-Wilk Test of Normality, Normal P-P Plot, Histogram, and Skewness/Kurtosis. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below .05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution. If the points are generally along the diagonal of the Normal P-P Plot, the assumption is met.
If the Histogram is approximately normal (distribution curve is bell-shaped), the assumption is met.
If Skewness and Kurtosis are between +2 and -2, the assumption is met. How far a case is from some point of reference <br>Identifies the distance of cases from the mean (s) of predictor (s). Extreme cases in multivariate space are found via a cut-off point (critical value of <a data-href="Chi-Square Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/chi-square-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chi-Square Test</a>) Measure the distance between an observed value and its predicted value that have all been converted to z-scores.
Typically flag cases if they are 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean. How far a point deviates from the mean of that variable.
Gauges the influence of the observed values over the predicted values. Ranges from zero to (N – 1) / N
Average value is (k + 1) / N

Typically flagged if value is over 1 Factor loadings help determine which variable is associated with which latent factor. For example, several likert-scale questions on a questionnaire observing psychological outcomes may load highly on a ‘depressive/depression’ factor, showing they measure the same underlying construct. Higher values of factor loadings (e.g., &gt; .4 or .5) indicate that a variable is a strong indicator of that factor. Lower values suggest the variable is less relevant to that factor. EFA can allow us to group variables with higher factor loadings on the same factor, reducing the complexity of our data.

The eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by each factor. If using the eigenvalue cutoff of 1, the cutoff is greater than 1 because the retained factors explain more variance. This can be seen on the Scree plot where there is a point where the slope of the curve changes, which is usually the cutoff for the number of factors we would retain. Factors to the left of the cutoff are considered meaningful. This is why there are only 3 out of the original 12 factors that were extracted from the analysis. The first three factors account for more of the variance in the model.

Descriptive statistics describe the state of the data. It summarizes and describes the characteristics of a data set whereas inferential statistics infer information about the sample participants based on their data.

Often, studies are organized into collections in each archive so a researcher can quickly identify groups of studies focused on a particular subarea. The organization of each archive varies, but most share several major features. Most archives allow you to perform basic descriptive analyses before the downloading a dataset. This is great because you can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in repsonses, for your purposes.

Is the method described clearly?
If sampling was used, what was the procedure and what were the associated sampling errors and response rates?
Who was responsible for collecting or recording the data?
(For surveys) Is a copy of the questionnaire or interview checklist included?
(For compiled data) Are you clear how the data were analyzed and compiled?
Are the data likely to contain measurement bias?
What was the original purpose for which the data were collected?
Who was the target The most important step is to read ALL the data documentation. Before assessing data, review codebooks and questionnaires What information was collected
For whom and when and where
What changes were made before archiving Codebooks also include other information (e.g., topics addressed, questions and measurements used, frequency of responses or values, how to use the data, etc.)
Like a regular book, some codebooks are better than others. If people code the variable in a certain way, is there potential for error? Would two researchers get the same outcomes if they chose to code the variable differently?

You do not need to install any package before using those functions
However, to access a function written by others (other than the original 'authors' of R), you first have to install it as a 'package.'
These packages often come with dataset(s), functions, examples, etc.
Install a package using 'install.Packages ('name of the package)')'
You need to install the package once and it will be on your computer permanently. After installing a package, you need to load it before having access to its functions, datasets, etc.
Use 'library(name of package)' to load a package. There are many functions to explore your data View to have a quick view of your data
Head to print out the first 6 rows
Tail to print out the last 6 rows
Summary to look at the summary of all your variables
Psych::describe to check the descriptive statistics
Use the dollar sign ($) to help select a specific variable E.g., mean(kids_score $age) will compute the mean for the variable age in the 'kids_score' dataset mean() to find the mean of a variable
sd() to find the standard deviation
var() to find variance
sum() to find the totals
Use '?' to learn more about a function
nrow(data) to find the number of rows

The order matters! Each effects partials out the one before it. So, if you are looking at a, b, and a x b The first value is for a
The value for b is after controlling for a
a x b's value is after controlling for a and b. Best for specific theory where order matters I.e., partial out certain variables first. a accounts for b and vice versa. This is best when you don't have an interaction effect. Every value accounts for every other effect (main or interaction) If order matters, Type I. If order does not matter, and there is no interaction, Type II. If order does not matter, but there is an interaction, Type III. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/in-class-content/6.-analysis-of-covariance-(ancova).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/GLM 2/In-Class Content/6.

A moderator is a variable that affects the strength or direction of the relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y).
A mediator is a variable that explains the mechanisms or process through which an independent variable (x) affects a dependent variable (y). The purpose of the ‘seed’ option in a line of PROCESS syntax is to lock the random number generator. This ensures that the findings remain consistent across multiple runs of the analysis. Without specifying a ‘seed’ value, the random number generator would draw different values each time, leading to slightly different results. When a covariable absorbs variable from both the predictor and the error term, it can lead to: Sphericity is an assumption in repeated measures ANOVA that states the variance of the differences between all pairs of within-subject conditions (levels of the independent variable) should be equal. This means that if we have three time points (A, B, C), then the variance of (A – B) ≈ variance of (A – C) ≈ variance of (B – C).
Sphericity is a special case of homogeneity of variance assumption and is specific to repeated measures designs.
Potential Consequences of Violating Sphericity Inflated <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> Rate (False Positives) Standard F-tests assume sphericity, so violating it increases the risk of finding a significant effect when none actually exists.
The p-values become too small, leading to incorrect conclusions. Reduced Statistical Power (False Negative) If sphericity is violated and not corrected, the test might be too conservative, making it harder to detect real effects (Type II Error: Failing to detect a true effect). Distorted F-ratios The denominator degrees of freedom in the F-test get inflated which makes the ANOVA test statistics biased. This impacts the accuracy of hypothesis testing. Long-Format Data

Repeated measures designs are an extension of the dependent group (paired samples) t-test.
Paired samples t-tests are used to compare means between paired, dependent, or matched groups. Collection of data on the same persons over time means responses are related to each other, across time. They are <a data-href="Dependent Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Observations</a> Differences from pre to post (e.g., time 1 to time 2)
Often the same respondents, repeatedly measured (not always, but not our focus) In comparison, independent-groups designs look at: Differences in means across groups (often manipulated in experimental designs)
Mean differences across existing groups Gender, school level, generation status (e.g., quasi-experimental designs) With repeated measures designs, the structure of the data becomes relevant. Data types Long Respondents have multiple rows of data corresponding to multiple measurement occasions Wide Respondents have one row of data
Multiple variables are used to represent multiple measurement occasions GLM for repeated measures (aka repeated measures ANOVA/MANOVA) Combination of both between-and within-subjects factors are referred to as 'mixed designs' Different people are assigned to different levels of the factor
Each case (person) is exposed/included to only one condition or level The same person tests all conditions (i.e., is exposed to all levels of the factor)
Repeated-measures designs are 'within-subjects' designs, where each subject forms a 'group' or factor Repeated measures ANOVA SST = SS (Explained) + SS (unexplained) We are trying to explain differences in teh repeated measures due to time (or whatever the within factor is)
We are removing/controlling variability due specifically to subjects. We need to characterize unexplained/residual variability carefully for repeated measures designs (i.e., through the subject x time interaction)
One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA One-Way Repeated measures ANOVA with A treatments/times and B persons includes three 'sum of squares' terms. <br><img alt="7.

Relatedly, homogeneity of covariance is equal variances and covariacnes across time. Sphericity is a tough assumption to meet, as we don't expect correlations between times 1, 3, and 5 to be necessarily the same. Mauchly's sphericity test in SPSS tests this assumption. We do NOT want this to be statistically significant. The distribution of the data will not be in line with an F-distribution
Loss of statistical power
Post-hoc tests become uninterpretable
If violated, what should we do? Use a more conservative f-test. SPSS gives you three options increasing in conservatism
Consider using MANOVA
Consider using multilevel modeling Based on estimates of sphericity (Epsilon; ε) Ranges from 0 - 1 with higher scores meaning greater homogeneity Huynh-Feldt Correction (least conservative) ε &gt; .75
Greenhouse-Geisser (more conservative) ε &lt; .75
Lower-bound (most conservative) ε &lt;. 75
If the results change depending on which correction used, it's a safer bet to use Greenhouse-Geisser regardless of Epsilon value (e.g., the cutoff somehow made a difference) or report both and acknowledge the difference. <br>Instead of time as treatment effect (univariate), MANOVA treats time as separate <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> s (multivariate)
Repeated measures analyses automatically include both, but if sphericity is violated, it might be better to just use MANOVA. Repeated Measures ANOVA Univariate DV
More rigid assumptions of sphericity
When sphericity holds, use RM ANOVA
You can look at contrasts and other post-hoc tests MANOVA Multivariate DVs
Less rigid assumptions of sphericity
A large violation of sphericity (ε &lt; .70) and sample sizes of 10 people larger than the number of groups (j + 1), use MANOVA. The power of MANOVA varies as a function of the correlation between the DVs. <br>Multilevel modeling approach (aka <a data-href="Hierarchical Linear Models" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/models/hierarchical-linear-models.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Linear Models</a>; General Linear Mixed-Effects Models)
Growth curve models Predicts individual differences in change over time Time is nested within each subject
Very flexible Allows for random effects and variability in measurement occasion. If the overall F for differences among treatments is statistically significant, further analysis is needed to evaluate where the significant differences are. The SPSS procedure contrasts that can be used to evaluate differences. If the repeated measure has k levels, a set of contrasts include (k - 1) comparisons
Options Polynomial contrasts (the default in SPSS, but rarely used in social sciences)
Repeated contrasts
Simple contrasts For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them. <br>Very similar to dummy coding in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a>, where we only know differences between the reference category and all other categories (not each other) Compare the mean of each level (except the last) with the mean of the subsequent level Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 2 &gt; Time 3 Useful if the responses are in a meaningful order (like time)
Equivalence (or justifiable inequivalence) of measurement is crucial Makes more sense when the levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to different amounts of treatment (rather than different types)
If there are k levels for the repeated-measures factor, then (k - 1) polynomials will be tested. Example
- Patients' responses to an anxiety drug administered over time

There must be an index variable that indicates timepoint for data
There must NOT be duplication of a case within a timepoint
Preferable if all cases have equal timepoints of data (makes things easier to see and is required by most analyses, though not necessarily for data restructure) Data &gt; Restructure &gt; Restructure Data Wizard!
Ignore the words SPSS uses (they are hard to understand) and instead look at the pictures. Wide to stacked is first, and stacked to wide is second. Ignore the third one (trust me). “7.

Leave everything else as default on all other pages!
“7. Repeated Measures Designs-4.png” could not be found. You need to tell SPSS how many variables you want to create. So, if the global satisfaction scale has seven items that we want combined across time, we need to say seven variables. “7. Repeated Measures Designs-5.png” could not be found.
Select your ID variable and put it as the case group identification. You could also 'use case number' and have the ID variable be a fixed variable, but I find that more troublesome. You then have to include all items to be stacked in separate blocks based on what the variable will be. You must do this for every variable to be stacked. The dataset has 129 such variables, so you can see that this will take a long time. Most of the time, stacked data comes stacked so you don't need to do this. “7. Repeated Measures Designs-6.png” could not be found. Repeated measure design in which two (and only two) paired variables are compared to each other. Typically, Time 1 and Time 2 are compared. Dependent samples t-test assesses differences, not changes. Change/growth requires three timepoints and often longitudinal modeling is used. Analyze &gt; Compare Means and Proportions &gt; Paired Samples t-test Always put the second timepoint first in the list so that you are getting authentic difference score. “7.

Assumption of Sphericity was met. Use top line – “Usual” F
<br>We reject our <a data-href="Null Hypothesis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/null-hypothesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Null Hypothesis</a>, F (4,28) = 9.435, p &lt; .001. There is significant difference in the mean fear of snakes during the different treatment times. Partial η2 = .574, indicating 57.4% of the variation in the scores is accounted for by the differences in the scores. When constructing our table, we have the Between Groups Line (the line for the test that we use for our final result).
We also have the Within Groups (error) line (the associated error line for whichever test we use).
But what about the between persons results and the total line? Below is the Test of Between Subjects Effects
We use the error line here to construct the Between Persons line “7. Repeated Measures Designs-14.png” could not be found. As for your Total Line, we just add Extension to the dependent t-test
Same individuals measured two or more times
Sometimes called a Within-Subjects Design
In a one-way repeated measures model, each subject responds to each level of the factor
In a balanced design Each subject responds to all J levels of the factor
Each of the n subjects has J scores do N = n x J
Unequal cells can only happen when subjects miss the administration of one or more levels of factor A A researcher tested whether 1-hour, biweekly yoga classes increased the fitness level of eight undergraduate studnets over a 4-month period (4 levels of within-subjects factors). Students were measured at the end of each month using a 10-point fitness measure (10 being most fit). “7. Repeated Measures Designs-10.png” could not be found.

The test scores were compared over time. Thus, we have 3 levels in the within-subjects factor (Time). For each pair of levels, we can obtain a st of difference scores. The sphericity assumption states that these three sets of difference scores have equal variance. If the variance of the difference scores are statistically equal then the sphericity assumption has been met. The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA
The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA. <br>The violation causes the 'Usual' F-test to become too liberal (i.e., an increase in the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate). Therefore, determining whether sphericity has been violated is very important. <br>Luckily, if violations of sphericity do occur, corrections have been developed to produce a more valid critical F-value (i.e., reduce the increase in <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate) Like in Levene's HOV test, the null hypothesis is the variances of difference scores are equal.

Measure: Score - Tests the null hypothesis that the error covariance matrix of the orthonormalized transformed dependent variables is proportional to an identity matrix: a Design: Intercept. Within Subjects Design: CAP. Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicates that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, , χ2 (2) = 7.916, p = .019.

Family Influences]]></title><description><![CDATA[I. OverviewThis document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:
The impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.
Parental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.
The interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.
The importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.
II. Key Themes and FindingsA. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)
Core Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.
Key Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.
"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
Secrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.
Increased secrecy is linked to "stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret."
Implications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.
B. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)
Core Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).
Key Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (ρ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).
Psychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.
Parental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
Cultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.
Implications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.
C. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)
Core Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.
Key Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms
Greater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.
"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
Racial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety
Implications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.
D. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)
Core Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.
Key Findings:"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
LGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.
Latino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents
Implications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.
III. Quotes
Frijns et al. (2010): "Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
Liu et al. (2020): "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
Montoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): "Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
Ryan et al. (2010): "Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
IV. Overall ImplicationsThese studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on strengthening family bonds, addressing both cultural and economic stressors, and promoting positive family dynamics to support healthy adolescent development.]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/7.-family-influences.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/7.

In this week's spotlight for attractions, we have Ohio History Connection (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" target="_self">https://www.ohiohistory.org/Links to an external site.</a>)!&nbsp;The Ohio History Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society, is a statewide history organization with the mission to spark discovery of Ohio’s stories. As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state’s history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;<br>For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://mozartscafe.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://mozartscafe.com/" target="_self">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart’s brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This "taste of Austria" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most "brilliantly illuminated city in the country." Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days. The leaves are falling! Where does the time go.&nbsp;Have a wonderful week, and please reach out to myself or Anna, our TA, if you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerAnother week, another (late) announcement,I hope you are having a great week, we are halfway through, whether that's the semester or the week you decide! This week we will begin to look at the basic patterns of sexual orientation and behavior. We also look at the critiques on sexual attitudes, sex education, and the sexual double standard. By the end of this module, you will be able to answer some questions such as...
What is sexual orientation? How have attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the medical and scientific communities?
According to researchers, what is the role of genetics, evolution, and social environment in determining sexual orientation?
REMINDER: Please put aside enough time to watch 'How to Lose Your Virginity' (1 hour and 6 minutes) and 'Sex 101' (20 min).&nbsp;<br>In this week's restaurant, I chose Belle's Bread.&nbsp;Tucked away in the Japanese marketplace located on Kenny Centre Mall,&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" target="_self">Belle’s BreadLinks to an external site.</a>&nbsp;is a family-owned and -operated, French-inspired Japanese bakery. Takashi Takenaka opened the business after immigrating from Japan in 1972, and he pays homage to childhood treats with his red bean roll, frank roll, and curry and boiled egg doughnuts. The bear-shaped strawberry cream bun is all over social media, but the best-kept secret is the Mont Blanc roll with its layers of delicate, airy sweet cream and chestnuts.&nbsp;<br>In Columbus Lore this week, our amazing student Doug Motz wrote this piece on the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" title="Link" href="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" target="_self">AIU &amp; The LeVeque TowerLinks to an external site.</a>. I learned so much information from this article, and it is just one piece of history from our city. Please take a moment to read through this article, if you get the chance. You know that big building that has those beautiful lights displayed at the top? Yup, that's this place! It has gone through it's fair share of history, and many owners. Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!! Just a wonderful piece of history to share with you all.&nbsp;Go outside and play in the leaves, take a moment to breathe. You have done so well, and I am so proud of you! Keep working hard as you always have, and remember to take care of yourself this week. :)Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerGoooooooood Evening Buckeyes!

On this week's Columbus lore, I thought I would bring it a little closer to home and look into OSU's history. You know that beautiful building you most likely walk by regularly called University Hall? Well, do I have some interesting facts for you.This was the first classroom building opened in 1873!&nbsp;<br>

On the first day of classes in September 1873, the students entered an unfinished University Hall. This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.<br>In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today’s University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today’s University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/" target="_self">https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/Links to an external site.</a>)For a random Columbus restaurant, I wanted something close to campus. I chose Emmett's Cafe! This bakery/cafe is located in the Old North.&nbsp;Inspired by Australian coffee culture, Emmett’s is the top pick for morning hangouts with a flat white or cold brew. This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks. Get that pumpkin spice latte for yourself, you deserve that treat! I can't wait to see the leaves falling all over campus.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn Ash (Lynn Reidinger)Hey Class,I apologize for missing our weekly announcement last week, but I was unfortunately not feeling well. We can't skip this week, what if some of you are waiting on this week's Columbus lore? As always, I will have interesting history, activities, and suggested restaurants below.You worked through your midterm, WOO! I am so proud of each of you for getting to this point in the semester. I can't believe we are almost finished. It has been a pleasure getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to each of you that congratulated me on my marriage, and this week seems very fitting!This week we look at marriage and cohabitation. Be mindful as we reflect on diversity, inequality, and social change in terms of marriage. We will consider how marital quality changes across the life course and illustrate the hallmarks of poor marital communication. Do you know what are the predictors of a high quality, satisfying marriage? What specific relationships come to mind when you think of a healthy marriage?This week's assignments are outlined below. As always, we accept your assignments 24-hours late with a 2-point deduction on your essays and discussions, and a 1-point deduction for your weekly reflections. We are unable to accept your InQuizitive quizzes late.&nbsp;Please read:

Originally, there was no formal plan for an Oval. The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps “The Five Brothers,” which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" target="_self">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!<br><img alt="Announcements-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png" target="_self">
Anthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony’s dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony’s son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony’s Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father. Realizing&nbsp;the quality of the candy was creating a demand, Tom and his father decided to make it a full time trade, and using their first names they formed the Anthony-Thomas Candy Company in 1952.Astounding Activities: The Scioto Deer&nbsp;“Announcements-8.png” could not be found.You may have probably seen at least one of the three bronze deer sculptures located throughout Columbus, but do you know why they’re actually there? It’s okay, neither did I. These friendly, relaxed-looking deer were added to the Scioto Mile as part of the big rehabilitation project in 2014 that&nbsp;turned the area into the incredible multi-use park and trail space it is now.There are a total of three deer along the Scioto River admiring the river, and they were put in during the renovation. Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don’t worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;I hope you all have a great week. I should be on tomorrow for our office hours if you may need anything (My office hours are Tuesdays from 1p-2p). Please take some time this week to soak in some sun and enjoy this fall weather. You have worked so hard to get to this point!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshIT'S HALLOWEEN!!!This is my favorite holiday, and it makes me so happy to see people dressed up while walking around campus. Make sure to grab some candy for yourself (... getting it on sale tomorrow does in fact count), and take it easy this week. This week's topic some of you may already have some experience with, whether directly or indirectly, parenting. We will analyze societal expectations and attitudes around parenthood and childlessness. We will also look at concepts of intensive motherhood, helicopter parenting, and co-parenting.&nbsp;REMINDERS:InQuizitive (Chapter 9): 11/1Discussion (Intensive Parenting): 11/3Essay 9: 11/5Reflection 9: 11/5<br>On this week's Columbus lore, we are back on campus with my personal favorite:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" target="_self">Mirror Lake</a><br>

It is very fitting to choose this wonderful place as our topic for Columbus Lore. The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!“Announcements-9.png” could not be found.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" target="_self">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a>On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn’s products.Astounding Activities:&nbsp;“Announcements-10.png” could not be found.<br>For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" target="_self">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape.

Mr. Ted has been coming to campus with me, so if you ever see us walking by don't be afraid to say hi!Have a fantastic week!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHi Buckeyes!Though we are not covering anything this week, I wanted to send an announcement out to all of you regarding the event that will take place for each of you tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHappy Tuesday everyone!Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life. We discuss examples of implicit bias and microaggressions and how they impact the individual and family.&nbsp;<br>We will be reading Chapter 3 in Cohen (2020) this week, which is posted under the top module labelled '<a title="Textbook Information" class="internal-link" data-href="/courses/180658/modules/1814602" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Textbook Information</a>.' You will also be taking a look at a few videos on racism and microaggressions.&nbsp;Things to keep in mind for this week:

Title: A qualitative examination of familial racial-ethnic socialization experiences among multiracial American emerging adults., Author: Atkin, Annabelle L.; Jackson, Kelly F.; White, Rebecca M. B.; Tran, Alisia G. T. T.; Journal: Journal of Family Psychology, Volume: 36,

This qualitative interview study investigated the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages received by Multiracial American youth over the course of their development. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.

Virginia case. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18. There is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families. Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict. <br><a data-href="Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)</a> <br><a data-href="Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation</a> Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.
This model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development. Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.
MultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status. Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth: Cultural Socialization Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. Racial Identity Socialization Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves. Preparation for Bias Messages Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. Egalitarian Socialization Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same Negative Socialization Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial Exposure to Diversity Messages Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. No Racial-Ethnic Socialization Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews Racial Identity Socialization
Preparation for Bias Socialization
Colorblind Socialization
Diversity Appreciation Socialization
Race-Conscious Socialization
Exposure to Diversity Socialization
Negative Socialization
Silent Socialization Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture. Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures. Language Socialization There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group. Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned. "You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such." Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them. Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.
One way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@atkinqualitativeexaminationfamilial2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

The biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence stimulate young people to think about themselves, reﬂect on the kind of people they want to become, and ﬁnd their place in society. Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson’s theory and Marcia’s identity status model, but process-oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents ﬁnd a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well-being.

Teaching and talking about race and ethnicity with children and adults is especially important in racially diverse societies. This process has been coined racial/ethnic socialization (RES). Despite the importance of RES, we still know very little about how this process unfolds in the lives of White youth. Thus, from a social, cognitive, and developmental perspective, the authors summarize ﬁndings from empirical research and theory on RES for White youth across stages of development—early childhood through young adulthood. Since RES is linked with cross-group attitudes (e.g., less bias, prejudice, stereotyping) and behaviors (e.g., inclusion), we highlight future directions for research and discuss applications for existing ﬁndings for an increasingly diverse society.

Title: Ethnic–Racial Socialization in the Family: A Decade's Advance on Precursors and Outcomes, Author: Umaña‐Taylor, Adriana J.; Hill, Nancy E.; Journal: Journal of Marriage and Family, Volume: 82,

Abstract
In the current decade, the U.S. population reached historically high levels of ethnic–racial diversity and reelected the nation's first Black–White biracial President. Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic–racial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‐seated ethnic–racial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic–racial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic–racial socialization in this decade. Furthermore, although it is clear that family ethnic–racial socialization is a robust predictor of youths' adjustment, the associations between socialization and adjustment must be considered with attention to specific socialization strategies, the confluence of strategies used, and the unique contexts within which families' lives are embedded.

Cultural-­ecological theories posit that ethnic-r­ acial identity (ERI) development is shaped by transactions between contexts of ethnic-­racial socialization, yet research considering intersections among multiple contexts is limited. In this study, Black, Latino, White, and Asian American adolescents (N = 98; Mage = 16.26, SD = 1.09; 55.1% female identifying) participated in surveys and focus group discussions (2013–­2014) to share insights into ERI development in context. Using consensual qualitative research, results indicated: (a) family ethnic-­racial socialization intersects with community-­based, peer, media, and school socialization; (b) ethnic-­ racial socialization occurs outside family through intersections between peer, school, community-­based, and media settings; and (c) ethnic-r­ acial socialization is embedded within systems of racial oppression across contexts. Discussion includes implications for future research and interventions supporting youth ERI.

Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood that begins around the onset of puberty and ends with relative independence from the parent. This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.

The dual-system based largely on Metcalf &amp; Mischel's (1999) two-system model of willpower. According to the model, self-control results from a balance between a 'cool' and a 'hot' system. The cool system is an emotionally neutral, strategic, and flexible cognitive system. The hot system is emotionally driven by fears, desires, and reflexes.

A research question is a statement that identifies the phenomenon to be studied. For example, "Does preschool influence children's language skills?" Why are good research questions important and what makes them 'good?' Purpose
Relevance
Feasibility To produce a research question, you need to know the literature first. Find out what has been done and how you can contribute to the existing literature. I have a research question. If you do not have a research question, narrow down your topic. Review the literature
Is the question viable, original. feasible?
You have a research question! Narrow down on an area of interest
Within that area, try to answer a question that: Has either not been addressed before
Has been addressed before but that you could extend (i.e., new data-set, different approach, etc.)
Has been addressed but requires replication
Starts a new research area (NOT recommended) Read as much as you can on the topic
Read recent studies first, then read backwards
Read all relevant papers (or at least the influential ones)
Ideas on the research topic often come from reading
The more you read, the easier it will be to come up with research questions Reviewing the literature will allow you to understand whether your question has been answered/is valid.
By reading previous studies, you might get ideas on how to tweak your original research question into a new one. Whether you have or do not have a research question, it is crucial that you review the literature in the area first. Many leave the review as the last step, but this is dangerous. Not original
Not feasible Time constraint (e.g., not enough time)
Resources (e.g., lack of data)
Knowledge (e.g., do I know method X?) Too broadly defined research question
Not well justified
Not motivated by literature Start searching for a topic as early as possible
Once you narrow down a topic/area, look at the relevant literature (i.e., a literature review)
Once you have done the literature review (has it already been done? No, why not? Is it interesting/relevant?), then ask yourself: Is the question specific (not too broad)?
Is it feasible in the allotted time?
Do I have enough resources (data) to answer this question?
How about knowledge (methods)?
Is the research question falling within my area of research?
If the answer is yes to all the previous question, congratulations, you have a research question. Your time is your most important resource. Do not take a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances) Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic/data set
More efficient time use (e.g., read similar lit)
Looks good when others are evaluating your CV A good research question will Allow outsiders to see your intentions
Help you develop hypotheses (not always)
Contributes to existing knowledge Contribution does not have to be huge
Replication is a contribution
Filling a gap is not enough justification, why does this gap matter? Guide the design of your methods
Allow the target population to be identified
Identify the outcome variables and key predictors of those variables
Determine what type of study is needed (e.g., descriptive, correlational, experimental)
Identify background characteristics that might influence predictors and outcomes
Raise questions about how to best collect data
Influence the number of participants in the study Writing a good question is an iterative process What do you want to learn about?
Draft and redraft with increasing specificity using the guidelines listed above. Ask for feedback from colleagues (science is a collective effort).
Build on the work of others by conducting a systematic literature review. This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. Hook the reader in. Practice! Explain the larger context that this study will inform. Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. Flows directly from the earlier points in paragraph 1. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. State the basic aims, hypotheses, questions, and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths) Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph - could be theoretically, in terms of policy, filling holes, etc. Can be combined with paragraph 2 in some cases.

The main question of interest was the extent to which personality traits at the time of marriage predict marital satisfaction and marital commitment post marriage. The researcher wrote two papers. One focused on the prediction of marital satisfaction, and the other focused on the prediction of marital commitment. The design of the study was he same in each paper, with the exception of the change in outcomes. Piecemeal A researcher recruited newlyweds and planned annual assessments over a five years. Some measures were assessments over a five years. Some measures were common to each annual assessment, whereas others common to each annual assessment, whereas others were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote an article regarding the relation between divorce history an article regarding the relation between divorce history and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital satisfaction from those who did not experience the satisfaction from those who did not experience the transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The researcher decided to publish these as three separate researcher decided to publish these as three separate articles. Not Piecemeal Researcher B was interested in the relation between family process and adolescent adjustment. She conducted and published a study in which the main conducted and published a study in which the main objective was to identify specific family processes that objective was to identify specific family processes that mediated the relation between family structure and mediated the relation between family structure and adjustment. Later, she read a new study that proposed that two of the family processes that she studied had an interactive effect on adjustment. Although such an interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, in additional analyses she found that such an effect did occur in her sample, although in a slightly different than in the newly published article. She wrote a second article to address this issue. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the extent to which support for marriage from family and friends affects rating of relationship quality. He collected data from a large convenience sample. Although not planned, the sample contained about 60% of persons in their first marriages and 40% of persons in remarriages. The researcher prepared two papers that examined the question of interest. In the first paper, he used data from the first-marriage subjects, whereas in the second paper he used data from the remarried subjects. The variables assessed and reported in the two papers were the same. Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the links between family structure and child adjustment. The researcher administered a survey to high school students. She discovered that there were large numbers in two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families, but very few students were in the single divorced father and stepmother families as part of the survey, students in stepfamilies answered survey items regarding the parenting behaviors of their stepparents as well as of their parents. She wrote two papers. The first examined differences in adjustment in children from two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families (the groups with the largest sample sizes). To facilitate the interpretation of family structure effects, she decided to exclude the rather small number of students in the second paper, she explored whether children's adjustment was related to how they rated the parenting behaviors of their parents and stepparents. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in rates of divorce in first-marriages and remarriages in different countries. She obtained data from an international organization that contained information on a number of different countries and wrote two papers. The first addressed the divorce rates in these two kinds of couples in Canada, and the second dealt with the same issue in England. The same theoretical rationale and measures were used in both papers, although the results led to different conclusions. Piecemeal Focus on quality and not quantity of publications Replicate the study with a different sample, setting, or methodology. Do this if most of the past research you have read examines one type of sample, setting, or method. Examine the topic using a different design. If the study was a quasi- or non-experimental, conduct an experiment. Do this if causation has not been consistently established by past research, or it has not been consistently established with the population you are interested in. Examine how another variable might impact results Do this if you have research evidence to suggest that results may depend on another variable. Conduct a similar study with a different outcome or dependent variable. Do this if you find research evidence supporting the new associations you plan to examine. Being first is not always a sign of being a good scientist Many discoveries are wrong or over claimed. You do not show you are a great scientist by being the first to claim something. A large part of getting over being scooped is getting over yourself and realizing that science is bigger than any one of us. It also means you are doing something other people care about. If you are scooped, do not be discouraged. It is unlikely that any two researchers would address a question in the exact same way. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

ISSN: 1477-9137, 0021-9533 Keywords: Read Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Henry Taube (who won the Novel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I did not know was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right answer or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. We don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid - that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity.' that kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, ‘I don’t know’. The point of the exam isn’t to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it’s the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student’s weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student’s knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@schwartzimportancestupidityscientific2008.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Title: The Art of Data Science, Author: Peng, Roger D; Matsui, Elizabeth; Year: 2018 Keywords: In Progress The thinking begins before you even look at a dataset, and it's well worth devoting careful thought to your question. This point cannot be over-emphasized as many of the 'fatal' pitfalls of data analysis can be avoided by expending the mental energy to get your question right. There are six basic types of questions. Descriptive
Exploratory
Inferential
Predictive
Causal
Mechanistic Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. The type of question you are asking directly informs how you interpret your results. A descriptive question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. There is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the set of data that you are working with. An exploratory question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. These types of analyses are also called 'hypothesis-generating' analyses because rather than testing a hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question, you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. An inferential question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data. A predictive question would be one where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal. In other instances, even if your data are not from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer a causal question. A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a mechanistic question. By necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions. If a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering the inferential question. The type of question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis).
If this type of data set does not exist, then the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illness. Establish your expectations about the question
Gathering information about your question
Determining if your expectations match the information you gathered, and then refining your question (or expectations) if your expectations did not match the information you gathered. There are five key characteristics of a good question for a data analysis, which range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already been answered to the more abstract characteristic that each of the possible answers to the question should have a single interpretation and be meaningful. The question should be of interest to your audience, the identity of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with data.
You should also check that the question has not already been answered. With the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon to discover that your question of interest has been answered already.
The question should also stem from a plausible framework. If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end up with an answer that's difficult to interpret or have confidence in. Many questions are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible framework. The question, should also, of course, be answerable.
Specificity is also an important characteristic of a good question. Working towards specificity will refine your question and directly inform what steps to take when you start looking at data.
With this degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will either recommend or not recommend the specific action. Another aspect to consider when you’re developing your question is what will happen when you translate it into a data problem. Every question must be operationalized as a data analysis that leads to a result. Pausing to think through what the results of the data analysis would look like and how they might be interpreted is important as it can prevent you from wasting a lot of time embarking on an analysis whose result is not interpretable. The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question that uses inappropriate data. The problem with this question is that for a single possible answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations arises when at least one of the variables you use is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after. To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required to answer your question. A related problem that intergeres with interpretation of results is confounding. Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship between factors. A brief description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both your exposure of interest and your outcome of interest. As you refine your question, spend time identifying the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information about these potential confounders. Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a biased result. The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics above what exists in the general population. A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors, bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person might recall the past when responding to a survey. The best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the question with the data available to you. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@pengartdatascience2018.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Secondary data analysis of large longitudinal and national data sets is a standard method used in many social sciences to answer complex questions regarding behavior. In this article, we detail the advantages of using these data sets to study developmental questions across the life span. First, we provide an overview of how using secondary data can increase studies’ scientiﬁc integrity. Then, we detail where and how data sets can be obtained that answer speciﬁc questions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues related to using longitudinal, population data sets. These data sets can enhance science and test theories by increasing the rigor and generalizability of research to the general population, making secondary data analysis an important method to consider.
Keywords: Need to Read Primary data are collected by an individual or a team of researchers and are often based on the theory or models of the researcher or research team. These data are also generally proprietary and not shared with the larger research community. In contrast, secondary data analysis uses data collected by other researchers or organizations, and the users are generally not part of the design of the study. These data sets (e.g., most national studies) have been collected for the use of the research community or have been made available for other researchers to use (e.g., in data archives). These data sets were collected based on the research theories and models of the primary researchers and include extensive measurements on the areas of interest to the research team. Although some data sets remain proprietary to the original researcher or research team, new regulations on data sharing from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are increasing the amount of data available for secondary data analysis. Many secondary data sets contain similarities in measurement that allow many data sets to be combined using techniques such as integrative data analysis, a technique that is especially useful for data sets that represent highly selective groups (e.g., children of alcoholics) that would be difficult to find in a general population sample. Combining the data sets increases the sample size and thus the power to examine these groups. Using secondary data sets, especially those collected at the population level, increases statistical power and external validity as a result of a larger sample size and greater diversity of respondents (with regard to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). This advantage, combined with reducing the time and money it takes to collect one's own longitudinal data, makes secondary data analysis a good option.
These data resources are easy to obtain. In the US, the two largest social science data archives are the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Murray Research Archive.<br>
<img alt="Social Science Secondary Data Archives Table.jpeg" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/social-science-secondary-data-archives-table.jpeg" target="_self">
ICPSR requires affiliation with a member institution. Some data sets are available for immediate download while others require an application explaining the scientific purpose for data use. Data are generally free though fees may apply for digitization of not-yet digital materials or other labor-intensive data-preparation tasks. Archives are easily searchable, including the ability to search by study topic or variable name. Searching by study topic is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching by variable name is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching for variable name is helpful when the researcher is interested in a particular variable, such as rates of endorsement or forms of measurement of a variable across studies. Most archives allow researchers to perform basic descriptive analyses online before downloading a data set, including frequency counts for each variable and tabular analysis. Scientists can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in responses, or not too much missing data for the new study. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. The most important step is to read all the data documentation - text documents posted in the data archive alongside the data. Understanding and properly accounting for the sampling frame and necessary weights are crucial in producing accurate results, and the study documentation contains the necessary information. Secondary data rarely have all the measures to answer investigators' questions. Using data that have been collected by others typically means that measures for some of the constructs germane to the research question will be missing. Because population data sets typically measure a broad set of constructs with limited measurement on any given construct, they often are not ideal for answering nuanced questions that require in-depth measurement. Once a researcher has addressed the issue of obtaining the data set or sets to address his or her research questions and whether they adequately answer the relevant research questions, additional statistical issues must be considered in analyzing this data. Because oversampling of one or more subpopulations is common in population-based studies, researchers often must apply a same weight if they want their findings to generalize to the target population. Subpopulations that are underrepresented in the sample relative to the target population have sample weights larger than 1.0, while the opposite holds for subpopulations overrepresented in the sample relative to the target population. When no sample weights are applied, it is as if a sample weight of 1.0 is uniformly applied to all subpopulations. In effect, this assumes all subpopulations are represented accurately within the sample, leading to biased estimates when this assumption does not hold. Typically, the appropriate set of sample weights and its corresponding variable name are identified clearly within a data set's documentation files. <br>In contrast to sample weights, which adjust for <a data-href="Sampling Bias" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/sampling-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sampling Bias</a>, attrition weights correct for bias introduced by attrition. The objective of attrition weights is to render the Wave 2 sample comparable to the full Wave 1 sample. Mathematically, attrition weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition or dropping out: P (Wave 1) / (Wave 2) Combination weights (also called longitudinal weights) adjust for both sampling bias and attrition bias. Mathematically, combination weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., the sample weight) multiplied by the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition (i.e., the attrition weight): [P (target population) / P (sample)] x [P (Wave 1) / P (Wave 2)].
We suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights (either alone or as a part of combination weights) and instead of using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), or multiple imputation (MI) to adjust for attrition bias and then use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias. We make this recommendation because relative to FIML and MI, attrition weights (including combination weights) have two disadvantages: Unlike FIML and MI, attrition weights often sharply reduce the analytical sample size and, thereby, statistical power. Typically, only those participants with data at every wave are assigned an attrition weight and used in subsequent analyses. This problem is compounded as a study's number of waves (and therefore attrition) increases. Second, if many auxiliary variables (i.e., non-model variables related to missing data) are incorporated, FIML and MI may adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights. Most statistical packages can use FIML, including STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS, and AMOS, and many use MI (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS). Most large-scale data sets were collected using complex sample designs that entail a clustered sampling design (e.g., schools are randomly sampled and then all students within the selected schools are sampled). <br>Because a clustered sampling design reduces variance (e.g., 100 students from the same school are likely more similar to one another demographically than are 100 students from 100 different schools), it also reduces standard errors and thereby inflates the change for <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. To adjust for these design effects, a primary sampling unit variable (e.g., schools) and potentially a stratification variable are incorporated into analyses. Most statistical packages (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS) can adjust for a complex sampling design and typically the appropriate primary sampling unit and, if necessary, stratification variables are clearly identified within a data set's documentation files. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/2.-research-questions-and-research-ethics/readings/@davis-keanansweringdevelopmentalquestions2015.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/2.

Developmental Systems Perspective Adolescent development is best understood as a dynamic interplay between the individual and their changing context. Long-term impact of adolescence While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. Developmental Systems Model This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. This model emphasizes Change and Relative Plasticity Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development Relationism and Integration Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. Historical Embeddedness and Temporality Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. Implications for Research and Application This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions. 'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes. This knowledge will inform effective policies and interventions to maximize the positive potential of adolescence for individuals and society as a whole. ]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/1..html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/1..md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 03:24:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
