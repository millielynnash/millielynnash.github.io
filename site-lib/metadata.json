An introduction to the Managing Your Mental Health group was provided. Intake paperwork was reviewed including the informed consent, confidentiality, mandated reporting, and the group therapy treatment agreement. Assessed symptoms (frequency, intensity, duration). Clients introduced themselves by stating their name, employment/school status, current living situation, a funny fact, something they do well, and something they do for fun. The psychoeducational topic today was mindfulness. Mindfulness was defined as a state of awareness, attention, and intention.

I considered telling you that I would practice skills for you, so you don’t have to practice them. But then I realized that if I did, you would not learn how to be skillful yourself. So, instead, I wish you skillful means, and I wish that you find these skills useful.”&nbsp; Facilitate Mindfulness Guessing Item Activity: Start by educating on mindfulness (observing, describing, participating, being non-judgmental, one-mindful, and effective). Explore how these aspects of mindfulness will be integrated into the activity. Put items into a bag. Go around the room, everyone closes their eyes except the describer. The describer describes the item you gave them starting with broad descriptions and moving into more specifics. I usually write on the board types of descriptions in case the person gets stuck such as the shape, purpose, feel, color, weight, size, texture, smell, taste, etc. As the describer begins describing the object, the rest of the group begins guessing what it is, until some gets it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Wise Mind Activity:&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding what is emotion mind, rational mind, and wise mind.&nbsp; Invite clients to draw what it looks like for you to be in rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Wise Mind Activity: [SKIP]&nbsp; Chain of commitments to wise mind: cut slips of paper, write or draw descriptions of wise mind, hand the chains in your room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise:&nbsp; Ask group members to identify one thing in their life right now that they know they need to accept. They can take a moment to identify that thing, write it down, and maybe even describe why they belief they need to accept it.

We want to honor and acknowledge those differences but also brings to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. This process might prove difficult or awkward. This is about getting to know each other and breaking down stereotypes. You can choose if and how you participate. This acticity is simple. Each one of us will read a statement. If the statement is something you have experienced, you cross the line. We will then reset and read the next statement. This exercise has to be done in complete silence.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to help students become more aware of the many types of diversity that exist and to find students who share the same experiences. For this exercise, students form a line across the classroom. Students are asked to step forward and then back into the line based on questions asked by the instructor. Start with questions that are non-threatening to get students comfortable with the exercise. Students can choose to “pass” if they want. Vary the questions to suit your group of students. Listening: Let’s have silence throughout the exercise – no talking, snickering, giggling, etc. Silence will allow all of us to participate fully. Silence will also enable us to experience our personal thoughts and feelings more deeply. Respect: It is imperative that we respect the dignity of each person who is here. Everything that is shared should remain confidential. Nothing that is offered should leave this room. Each statement will require you to make the decision crossing the line or not crossing the line. There are no right or wrong answers. NO PRESSURE. No one here is under any pressure to respond in any particular way to any of the questions. If you have any doubts about sharing some part of yourself, you should feel perfectly comfortable with your decision not to step forward.\nWhat kind of feelings did you have as you participated?\nHow did you feel when there were fewer of you on one side of the room?\nHow did the movement of others influence you?\nWhat did you learn through this activity that can make our group more welcoming. Walk across the line if your favorite color is blue. Look into the eyes of those you brought with you. Look at those you left behind. Allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling. Walk back across the line.\nQuestions: You prefer the city. You have visited another country. You have never flown. You know very little about your cultural heritage. You are the oldest in your family. You have lost someone you loved. You are from Ohio. You enjoy sports. You are an only child. You got picked on in school. Your parents divorced. You consider yourself a religious person. You prefer Coke to Pepsi.\nYou prefer vanilla to chocolate.\nYou have been in love\nYou have had surgery. You have lived in another state. You know someone who has been sexually assaulted. You have felt alone, unwelcomed, afraid. You knew someone who has attempted to die by suicide. You have cried at least once this year for someone or something other than yourself. You or someone you know is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. You have been a bystander to a racial, sexual, or cultural joke. You have read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. You did not cross the line in a previous statement when you should have. You are willing to understand, support, and celebrate diversity. If you have not crossed the line during this activity, cross it now. Here are some additional questions: Walk across the line if you have ever experienced a bad hair day.\nWalk across the line if you are undecided about your major. Walk across the line if your parents are divorced. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is in a gang. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about lives in poverty. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about has been homeless. Walk across the line if you have been told or think you are fat. Walk across the line if someone you care about has been abused physically, psychologically, or sexually. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is dependent on alcohol or drugs.\nWalk across the line if you know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Walk across the line if you know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDS. Walk across the line if you have been put down by someone else and it hurt you. Walk across the line if you put someone down and you knew it hurt them. At the conclusion of this exercise, ask students what they learned from it.

Pass the bowl around and have each person take one item. Mindfully observe the piece of fruit for a few minutes. When the bell rings everyone puts the fruit back into the bowl and then see if each person can \"recognize\" their original fruit.\nInstructions: First take your piece of fruit and weigh it up in your hands. Get a sense of the texture of the skin, the temperature, the weight, how it feels in the palm of your hand, how it feels as you run your fingertips across its surface. What do you notice here? Spend a few moments doing this.\nNext, we are going to use our sense of smell to breathe in the scent of the fruit. What do you notice here? Try to stay with just sensing the fruit, perhaps notice if your mind begins to make associations.\nYour mind will likely wander or begin thinking about things as you move through this exercise, so just notice make a note of these thoughts, and come back to paying full attention using your five senses.\nNext, take a good look at the fruit. Noticing its visual qualities - color, shape, any irregularities, the stalk, surface texture. Just take it in - looking for details. Keep an eye out for any tendency to make comparisons or judge the fruit! You'd be surprised how often our mind rushes to judgements.\nYou could try next bringing the fruit up to your ear and listening to the sound it makes when you squeeze it or tap it. What sound does a fruit make? (I'll bet you never wondered that before!)\nNext, take a few moments to feel your fruit. Noticing how it feels. Is it smooth? Is it rough?\nBring the practice to a close when you are ready.\nWhen you are finished, it's good to reflect on the exercise... what did you notice? Was anything surprising? Where did your mind go? What do you miss when you are on autopilot? How might the skill of mindfulness and observing be helpful to you in your daily life? Under what circumstances might you use this skill?

Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. Chronic, severe, persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations: Temper outbursts: These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others).\nThey must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion 3) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria 5 and 6). Chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion 4) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Consistent gender difference in prevalence have not been reported in population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance. The diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (6-18 years).\nChildren with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. A relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of: <br><a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Major Depressive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Major Depressive Disorder</a> Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A family history may be a risk factor. Those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The same behavior deficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. Socioeconomic factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as post-conflict zones or communities affected by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and transitory. While irritability has a strong genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role. Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common. <br>Differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from <a data-href=\"Bipolar Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bipolar Disorder</a> and <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> requires particularly careful assessment. <br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and <a data-href=\"Bipolar Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bipolar Disorder</a> s in children involved longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child. During a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baselines. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. The irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder required severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. <br>In only approximately 15% of individuals with <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. There is a more prominent mood component among individuals with mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. It should also be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood patterns. Children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. Children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual's mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice-weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. These two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. <br>The strongest overlap is with <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. <br>If children have symptoms that meet criteria for <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> or <a data-href=\"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a> and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.

Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"\nDepression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.\nTo be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.\nThere are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances. Includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities. (Also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder)\nConsists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years. Depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression. Depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. A severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see). Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributed to another medical condition) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others 9 e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\nMarkedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)\nSignificant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\nInsomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\nPsychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\nFatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\nDiminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)\nRecurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The episode is not attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria 1-3 represents a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., <a data-href=\"Bereavement\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bereavement</a>, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion 1, which may resemble a depressive episode. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity.\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: Major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. Specify if: With anxious distress (pg. 210-211)\nWith mixed features (pg. 211)\nWith melancholic features (pg. 211-212)\nWith atypical features (pg. 212)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (pg. 213)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (pg. 213)\nWith catatonia (pg. 213) [Coding Note: Use additional code F06.1]\nWith peripartum onset (pg. 213)\nWith seasonal pattern (applies to pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes) (pg. 214) Major depressive disorder is defined by the presence of at least one major depressive episode occurring in the absence of a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day, nearly every day (Criterion 1). The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes: Changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity\nDecreased energy\nFeelings of worthlessness or guilt\nDifficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. To count toward a diagnosis of a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared with the individual's pre-episode status. The symptoms must occur nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation, which must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs to occur once. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly increased effort. The presenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest. The failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near delusional guilt.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps' (Criterion 1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, 'not caring anymore,' or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion 1.2)\nFamily members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations. In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion 1.3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion 1.3). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too ealry and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume)\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is Depression?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Depression?_0"},{"heading":"Types of Depression","level":3,"id":"Types_of_Depression_0"},{"heading":"Major Depression:","level":4,"id":"Major_Depression_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)\" href=\"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Persistent_Depressive_Disorder_(Dysthymic_Disorder)]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Perinatal Depression\" href=\"Perinatal Depression\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perinatal Depression</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Perinatal_Depression]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\" href=\"Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Seasonal_Affective_Disorder_(SAD)]]_0"},{"heading":"Depression with Symptoms of Psychosis:","level":4,"id":"Depression_with_Symptoms_of_Psychosis_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic Criteria:","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_Criteria_0"},{"heading":"Coding and Recording Procedures","level":3,"id":"Coding_and_Recording_Procedures_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic Features","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_Features_0"}],"links":["clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/perinatal-depression.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html#_0",".html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412060516,"modifiedTime":1742962300255,"sourceSize":9919,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Major Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/other-specified-depressive-disorder.html":{"title":"Other Specified Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/other-specified-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412133059,"modifiedTime":1742962301842,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Other Specified Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/other-specified-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/perinatal-depression.html":{"title":"Perinatal Depression","icon":"","description":"\nPerinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy.

Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The word “perinatal” refers to the time before and after the birth of a child. Perinatal depression includes depression that begins during pregnancy (called prenatal depression) and depression that begins after the baby is born (called postpartum depression). Mothers with perinatal depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that may make it difficult for them to carry out daily tasks, including caring for themselves or others. The “baby blues” is a term used to describe mild mood changes and feelings of worry, unhappiness, and exhaustion that many women sometimes experience in the first 2 weeks after having a baby. Babies require around-the-clock care, so it’s normal for mothers to feel tired or overwhelmed sometimes. If mood changes and feelings of anxiety or unhappiness are severe, or if they last longer than 2 weeks, a woman may have postpartum depression. Women with postpartum depression generally will not feel better unless they receive treatment. Perinatal depression is a real medical illness and can affect any mother—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Women are not to blame or at fault for having perinatal depression: it is not brought on by anything a mother has or has not done. Perinatal depression does not have a single cause. Research suggests that perinatal depression is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Life stress (for example, demands at work or experiences of past trauma), the physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby, and changes in hormones that occur during and after pregnancy can contribute to the development of perinatal depression. In addition, women are at greater risk for developing perinatal depression if they have a personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder or if they have experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mental illness that occurs after childbirth. PP is a medical emergency, and it is important to seek help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Women who have PP can have delusions (thoughts or beliefs that are not true), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling things that are not there), mania (a high, elated mood that often seems out of touch with reality), paranoia, and confusion. Women who have PP also may be at risk for harming themselves or their child and should receive help as soon as possible. Recovery is possible with professional help. Some women may experience a few symptoms of perinatal depression; others may experience several symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of perinatal depression include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood\nIrritability\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\nFatigue or abnormal decrease in energy\nFeeling restless or having trouble sitting still\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\nDifficulty sleeping (even when the baby is sleeping), awakening early in the morning, or oversleeping\nAbnormal appetite, weight changes, or both\nAches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause or do not ease even with treatment\nTrouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with the new baby\nPersistent doubts about the ability to care for the new baby\nThoughts about death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby Treatment for perinatal depression is important for the health of both the mother and the baby, as perinatal depression can have serious health effects on both. With proper treatment, most women feel better and their symptoms improve.\nTreatment for perinatal depression often includes therapy, medications, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may be an option to explore. Several types of psychotherapy can help women with perinatal depression. Two examples of evidence-based approaches that have been used to treat perinatal depression include <a data-href=\"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> and interpersonal therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help people with depression and anxiety. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations. People learn to challenge and change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior as a way of improving their depressive and anxious feelings and emotions. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar concerns. IPT is an evidence-based therapy that has been used to treat depression, including perinatal depression. It is based on the idea that interpersonal and life events impact mood and vice versa. The goal of IPT is to help people to improve their communication skills within relationships, to develop social support networks, and to develop realistic expectations that allow them to deal with crises or other issues that may be contributing to their depression. Women with perinatal depression are most commonly treated with antidepressants, which are medications used to treat depression. They may help improve the way the brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should notify their health care provider before starting antidepressants so their&nbsp;health care provider can work to minimize the baby’s exposure to the medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take antidepressants during pregnancy is very low; however, women should work with their&nbsp;health care provider to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and to find the best solution for their situation. Women may need to try several different medications before finding the one that improves their symptoms and has manageable side effects.\nAntidepressants take time—usually 6 to 8 weeks—to work, and symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give medication a chance before deciding whether or not it works.\nDo not stop taking antidepressants without the help of a health care provider. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. When a woman and her health care provider have decided it is time to stop the medication, the health care provider will help her to decrease the dose slowly and safely.\nAfter the birth of a child, many women experience a drop in certain hormones, which can lead to feelings of depression. FDA has approved one medication, called brexanolone, specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. Administered in a hospital, this drug works to relieve depression by restoring the levels of these hormones. It is important to understand that depression is a medical condition that impacts the mother, the child, and the family. Spouses, partners, family members, and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of perinatal depression in a new mother. Treatment is central to recovery. Family members can encourage the mother to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.\n<br>Support or advocacy groups can offer a good source of support and information.

The signs and symptoms of SAD include those associated with depression as well as disorder-specific symptoms that differ for winter-pattern versus summer-pattern SAD.\nSymptoms of depression can include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks\nFeelings of hopelessness or pessimism\nFeelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\nDecreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\nChanges in sleep or appetite or unplanned weight changes\nPhysical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment\nThoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts For winter-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Oversleeping (hypersomnia)\nOvereating, particularly with a craving for carbohydrates, leading to weight gain\nSocial withdrawal (feeling like “hibernating”) For summer-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Trouble sleeping (insomnia)\nPoor appetite, leading to weight loss\nRestlessness and agitation\nAnxiety\nViolent or aggressive behavior Winter-pattern SAD should not be confused with “holiday blues”—feelings of sadness or anxiety brought on by stresses at certain times of the year. The depression associated with SAD is related to changes in daylight hours, not the calendar, so stresses associated with the holidays or predictable seasonal changes in work or school schedules, family visits, and so forth are not the same as SAD. To be diagnosed with SAD, a person must meet the following criteria: They have the symptoms of depression or the more specific symptoms of winter- or summer-pattern SAD listed above.\nTheir depressive episodes occur during specific seasons (winter or summer) for at least 2 consecutive years. However, not all people with SAD experience symptoms every year.\nTheir depressive episodes during the specific season are more frequent than depressive episodes experienced at other times of the year. It is estimated that millions of Americans experience SAD, although many may not know they have this common disorder. In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.\nSAD occurs much more often in women than in men. Winter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-pattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people living farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in the winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England are more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida.\nSAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves repeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes (less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I disorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other mental disorders, such as <a data-href=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href=\"Eating Disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Eating Disorders</a>, <a data-href=\"Anxiety Disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Anxiety Disorders</a>, or <a data-href=\"Panic Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Panic Disorder</a>. <br>SAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common in people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, such as <a data-href=\"Major Depressive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Major Depressive Disorder</a> or <a data-href=\"Schizophrenia\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schizophrenia</a>. Researchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most research to date has investigated potential causes of winter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier to study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern SAD, and more research is needed.\nStudies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-pattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also suggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help maintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may prevent these molecules from functioning properly, contributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.\nVitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in people with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is believed to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin D consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the winter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, further reducing serotonin activity.\nOther studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to altered levels of melatonin—a hormone important for maintaining the normal sleep−wake cycle. People with winter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can increase sleepiness and lead to oversleeping.\nIn contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have reduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days worsening sleep quality and leading to depression symptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high temperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, these theories have not been systematically tested.\nBoth serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body’s daily rhythm tied to the seasonal night−day cycle. In people with SAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal daily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to seasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and behavior changes.\nNegative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer and its associated limitations and stresses are also common among people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, however, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the mood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment. Treatments are available to help people with SAD. They fall into four main categories that can be used alone or in combination: Light therapy\nPsychotherapy\nAntidepressant medication\nVitamin D Light therapy and vitamin D are treatments for winter-pattern SAD, whereas psychotherapy and antidepressants are used to treat depression in general, including winter- and summer-pattern SAD. There are no treatments specific to summer-pattern SAD. Since the 1980s, light therapy has been a mainstay for treating winter-pattern SAD. It aims to expose people with SAD to a bright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in darker months.\nFor this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright light box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30−45 minutes, usually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light box, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor light, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making this a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain eye diseases or people taking certain medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative treatments or use light therapy under medical supervision. Psychotherapy can help people with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that contribute to depression.\n<br><a data-href=\"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a type of psychotherapy aimed at helping people learn to challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive and anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with SAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in two weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing negative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts about the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with more positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called behavioral activation, which helps people identify and schedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to offset the loss of interest they typically experience in the winter or summer.\nWhen researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light therapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving SAD symptoms—although some symptoms got better slightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a long-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters found that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer. Medications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can be effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with talk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress.&nbsp;\nAntidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work. Problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may need to try several medications to find the one that works best.\nBecause SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with disturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly enhance a person’s mood.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release form designed to last longer in the body. For many people, bupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive episodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring. Because many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. However, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD have produced mixed results, with some studies indicating that it is as effective as light therapy and other studies finding no effect. Because the onset of SAD is so predictable, people with a history of the disorder might benefit from starting the treatments mentioned above before the fall (for winter-pattern SAD) or spring (for summer-pattern SAD) to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms. To date, few studies have investigated whether SAD can be prevented.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is Seasonal Affective Disorder?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Seasonal_Affective_Disorder?_0"},{"heading":"What are the Signs and Symptoms of SAD?","level":2,"id":"What_are_the_Signs_and_Symptoms_of_SAD?_0"},{"heading":"How is SAD Diagnosed?","level":2,"id":"How_is_SAD_Diagnosed?_0"},{"heading":"Who Develops SAD?","level":2,"id":"Who_Develops_SAD?_0"},{"heading":"What Causes SAD?","level":2,"id":"What_Causes_SAD?_0"},{"heading":"How is SAD Treated?","level":2,"id":"How_is_SAD_Treated?_0"},{"heading":"Light Therapy:","level":3,"id":"Light_Therapy_0"},{"heading":"Psychotherapy:","level":3,"id":"Psychotherapy_0"},{"heading":"Antidepressant Medication:","level":3,"id":"Antidepressant_Medication_0"},{"heading":"Vitamin D:","level":3,"id":"Vitamin_D_0"},{"heading":"Can SAD be Prevented?","level":2,"id":"Can_SAD_be_Prevented?_0"}],"links":["clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0","university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["media/school-diagrams/prevalence/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html"],"createdTime":1705375082038,"modifiedTime":1742962309428,"sourceSize":11193,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/substance-or-medication-induced-depressive-disorder.html":{"title":"Substance or Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/substance-or-medication-induced-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412127006,"modifiedTime":1742962311404,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Substance or Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/substance-or-medication-induced-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/unspecified-depressive-disorder.html":{"title":"Unspecified Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/unspecified-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412136268,"modifiedTime":1742962313465,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Unspecified Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/unspecified-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html":{"title":"Bipolar Disorder","icon":"","description":"\nBipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.

Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity (over-activity).

The median age of diagnosis for severe ADHD was 4 years. The median age of diagnosis for moderate ADHD was 6 years.\nThe median age of diagnosis for mild ADHD was 7 years. Approximately one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. Medication can be used to effectively treat ADHD symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity, and is the single most effective treatment for reducing ADHD symptoms.\nFigure 2 is based on data from the NSCH and shows medication use among children with ADHD in 2011. An estimated 69.3% of children with a current diagnosis of ADHD received medication for ADHD.\nMedication use increased 4% overall from 2007 to 2011, particularly among male teens.\nFigure 2: <img alt=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/prevalence/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).png\" target=\"_self\"> Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey–Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), Figure 3 shows the lifetime prevalence of ADHD among U.S. adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.

Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href=\"Belmont Report\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belmont Report</a>, \"These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects.\"\nIn some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href=\"Belmont Report\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.\nWhenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the <a data-href=\"Belmont Report\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belmont Report</a>. . Informed Consent: People have the right to expect that researchers will treat them as autonomous individuals, respecting their decisions about whether to take part in research and about what personal information they will or will not share with others. This is accomplished through a thorough informed consent process that is presented in a language understandable to the research subject. The Consent Process: The federal regulations about informed consent list elements of information that the researcher must provide to subjects. The regulations divide the elements into two categories. One category includes basic elements to be provided to all subjects. The second set includes elements that must be provided, when appropriate. Consent should begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a subject in understanding the research, what is expected of them, and the potential risks of harm and benefits. Regulations require that this information be understandable to the subject and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. The emphasis on subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) comprehension and presenting information that a 'reasonable person' would want to have in order to make an informed decision to participate, and providing an opportunity to discuss. This 'key information' is not defined in the regulation, but examples of key information were provided in the preamble to the revised Common Rule: The fact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary. The purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective subject's participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research. The reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the prospective subject. The benefits to the prospective subject or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research. Appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the prospective subject.

Suicidal crises are often brief. While some attempts follow a long period of deliberation, other attempts are acted on hastily and may be difficult to predict. Most people who attempt suicide don't necessarily want to be dead, but they want the pain they feel to stop. Most people who attempt suicide and survive do not ultimately kill themselves - even people who make a very serious suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Crisis: The period when a person transitions from being at risk for suicide or considering suicide to being ready to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;make an attempt. Can come on rapidly\nCan be difficult to predict\nCan lead to an unplanned suicide attempt\nPeople were asked when they has first started thinking about making an attempt; 48% said they starting thinking about it within 10 minutes of attempting. Often brief The period during which a person is actually ready to take their life is usually brief. Rarely is it a chronic state. The impulse to die often fades. It may never recur, or it may flare up episodically. Duration of Suicidal Crisis: Evidence by Attempters: 0-10 minutes: 48%\n11-60 minutes: 2%\n1-24 hours: 9%\n1-7 days: 16%\n1-4 weeks: 15%\n1-12 months: 11% Long-Term Survival: More than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not actually kill themselves. 60% of people who commit suicide die on their first attempt. (Means reduction saves lives by decreasing the likelihood that an attempt will be fatal) In describing the moment he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, Ken Baldwin said, \"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped.\" It is not easy to determine. Examples: Clients who have suicidal thoughts. Clients who are in distress and have attempted suicide in the past. Clients who are struggling with mental health or substance misuse issues, especially if they are also coping with painful life crises. A clinician should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and feelings. Talking about suicide does not create or increase risk, in fact, it can reduce the risk of suicide. A clinician’s ability to calmly, compassionately, and matter-of-factly explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors may encourage an individual to disclose suicidality, if it exists. Often, clients who have considered suicide will be relieved that you raised the subject. Use direct questions about current or past suicidal thoughts and behavior. Let the client know that other people have similar thoughts and feelings.\nAny of your clients who have a prior history of suicidality or current distress could benefit from lethal means counseling. If your conversation with your client results in disclosure of past suicidal thoughts or behaviors, probe more about current suicidal feelings. Find out specific details about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Some Questions to Ask: Tell me about a couple of times in the past few months when things were the worst for you—did you think about suicide? If yes, then ask:&nbsp;Did you take any specific steps toward an attempt? What methods did you think about? What kept you alive?&nbsp; Tell me about the last couple of days—how much would you say suicide has been on your mind, if at all?&nbsp; If so, then ask:&nbsp;Are there specific methods you’ve thought about? Have you thought about how you'd kill yourself?&nbsp; If yes, then ask: Have you thought about when or where you'd kill yourself?\nIf they mention a specific method of suicide, then ask: What other methods are you thinking about? Is there a specific scenario where you think you would attempt suicide?\nHave you ever attempted suicide in the past, or started to? Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Lethal means counseling makes sense for anyone at risk.\nIndividuals who struggle with mental health and/or substance use issues, and who are experiencing a major crisis, stress, or trauma, are also at risk of suicide and should receive lethal means training. Individuals who currently have suicidal thoughts would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who struggle with mental health/substance abuse issues, especially when they are also experiencing painful life crises, would benefit from lethal means counseling. Ask clients at risk directly about suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Ask clients at-risk specifically about their suicide plans, such as how and when they would do it. Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. People sometimes deny these even when they exist. Also, suicidal thoughts can emerge rapidly and many attempts are unplanned. Lethal means counseling should take place before a suicidal crisis occurs. Firearms is the method used most frequently in suicidal deaths. Suicidal Death Rates by Method: 51% Firearms\n26% Suffocation/Hanging\n12% Poisoning/Overdose (Poisoning from intentional drug or medication overdoses)\n3% Gas Inhalation (Inhaling gas, usually carbon monoxide from motor exhaust)\n2% Jumping/Falling (Jump from high place like bridge)\n2% Cutting (Sharp instruments like razor)\n4% Other Methods (like drowning) The lethality of the method used in a suicide attempt is one of the biggest factors determining whether the person lives or dies. While the intent matters, means also matters. If the method a person wants to use for suicide if not available when they are actually ready to go through with an attempt, one of two things is likely to occur: They will delay the attempt as they try to get access to the method they want to use. The greater the delay, the greater the chance the suicidal crisis will pass. They will substitute another method. If the substituted method is less lethal, this increases the chance the person will not die. And most people who survive an attempt do not later go on to kill themselves. The two methods used in the majority of nonfatal suicidal attempts are overdosing with medications and cutting with sharp instruments. Many people think these two methods are far more deadly than they actually are. This misperception may save a lot of lives.\nWe recommend that you do not share specific information with your clients about the low lethality of sharp instruments and medications. Which suicide methods are amenable to a means reduction approach? It depends on the following criteria: Number of Suicide Deaths: The number/percent of suicide deaths caused by a specific method. Lethality: The proportion of attempts by a given method that end in death (case fatality rate). Irreversibility: The inability for someone attempting suicide to stop once it has begun or to be rescued. More people stop an attempt than carry through with it. Accessibility: The immediate availability of the method. Access is particularly important when attempts occur rapidly with little or no planning. Acceptability: Cultural and/or individual tolerance or preference for using a particular method to kill oneself. Cutting: Low Number of Deaths\nLow Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nHigh Acceptability Jumping/Falling: Low Number of Deaths\nHigh Lethality\nHigh Irreversibility\nLow Accessibility\nLow Acceptability Gas Inhalation: Low Number of Deaths\nModerate Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nModerate Accessibility\nLow Acceptability Poisoning/Overdose: Moderate Number of Deaths\nLow Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nHigh Acceptability Suffocation/Hanging: Moderate Number of Deaths\nModerate Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nModerate Acceptability Firearms: High Number of Deaths\nHigh Lethality\nHigh Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nHigh Acceptability Firearms are used in more suicide deaths in the US than all other methods combined. They are also highly lethal irreversible, and easily accessible in many homes with guns (one-third of homes have guns). Since gun owners can voluntarily undertake steps to reduce access, you will want to discuss safe firearm storage with all clients at-risk of suicide. Medication Overdoses are not as lethal as firearms (though some medications and poisons are very lethal). It is also usually possible for someone to stop an overdose mid-attempt or to be rescued. However, overdose is by far the most frequent method of attempt, and medications are easily accessible in most homes. Therefore, it is wise to routinely advise at-risk clients to dispose of unnecessary medications and keep accessible only quantities that do not pose a lethal threat. When your client's suicidal ideation focuses on any other method, you will want to discuss with them ways to reduce access to that method. More suicide deaths are from firearms than any other method in the US. Firearms, jumping, and suffocation are most lethal than other methods. Cutting and poisoning/overdose have low lethality, on average. The method used in a suicide attempt can determine whether the person lives or dies. Use a method reduction approach for any lethal method that is mentioned by clients at risk. How amenable each method is to a means reduction approach depends on the following criteria: Frequency\nLethality\nIrreversibility\nAccessibility\nAcceptability Since firearms are used in most suicide deaths and they are also highly lethal, acceptable, and accessible (in homes with guns), be sure to ask all clients at risk if they have access to firearms and discuss ways to reduce access. A method is considered lethal if a high proportion of attempts by that method end in death.\nApproximately 80%-90% of intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates.\nOnly 1%-2% of intentional, self-inflicted wounds from sharp instruments, like a razor, are fatal. Cutting is not a highly lethal method. However, it is the second most commonly used method in attempts. Only 1%-2% of intentional overdoses or poisonings are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates. This is on average, however, certain medications and poisons are far more lethal than others. In addition, medication overdoses are the most common method of suicidal attempts. People who attempt suicide typically struggle with ongoing mental health or substance abuse issues.\nWhile some attempts are planned, many are not. Acute suicidal crises are often brief, and escalation from thought to action can occur rapidly.\nThe lethality of the method used in an attempt can determine whether that person lives or dies. If a highly lethal means is not available, the individual's chance of survival is greater. Over 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not take their life later on, so reducing access to lethal means can save many lives.\nAn effective way to protect clients at risk of suicide is to reduce their access to highly lethal means before they experience an acute suicidal crisis. Feasibility: Can the client or their family actually take the steps at home to reduce access to the method? Reducing access to&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;and&nbsp;medications used for poisoning/overdose&nbsp;could feasibly be accomplished at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so could potentially save thousands of lives in the U.S. if routinely implemented with people at risk for suicide.\nAccess can be feasibly be reduced for these two methods: Firearms: Firearms are used in roughly half of all suicide deaths, are highly lethal, and are very accessible if they are kept at home. Medications: Medication overdoses are by far the most common method in suicide attempts. Although the vast majority do not result in death, some medications and medication combinations are highly lethal - and, if kept unlocked at home, very accessible. We recommend routinely discussing firearm and medication storage with all clients at risk of suicide. If a client's suicidal ideation focuses on a method other than firearms or medication, we also recommend discussing ways to reduce access to that method as well. When discussing firearm storage with clients and their family members, the goal is to maximize the client’s safety by reducing immediate access to firearms as much as possible while they are at risk for suicide. There are two main options for reducing access to firearms.\nSafest: Store firearms away from the home: Storing firearms away from home is the most effective way to ensure clients don't have easy access to a gun if they experience a spike in suicidal feelings. Off-site options are listed in the next section. Second-best: Secure storage inside the home: The second-best option is securely locking firearms in the home (or disassembling guns and locking a critical component). The person at risk should not have the keys, know where the keys are kept, or know the combination to the storage unit. Keep in mind that safes and locks can be broken into or picked, some more easily than others. But any measures that put time and distance between a suicidal person and a firearm may save their life. Storing firearms away from the home temporarily until the person improves is the best way to reduce access to them. Self-Storage Rental Units: Many facilities allow firearm storage. Typically, the smallest units are 5 ft. By 5 ft., but some offer storage drawers or bins, which are less expensive. Prices typically include a small one-time administrative fee as well as a monthly charge that depends on unit size. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored in a facility. Friends or Relatives: Storing firearms with a trusted person is an excellent and free option, provided the person is legally allowed to hold them. Some state laws require a background check prior to transfer to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing firearms. Shooting Ranges: Shooting ranges and sportsmen’s clubs sometimes offer locker rentals for a relatively low monthly fee. Typically, only the owner holds the key and no background check is required because the ownership of the guns is not transferred. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored. Law Enforcement: Some law enforcement agencies will temporarily store firearms for safety purposes; others will not. It is best to know the processes and policies in your region before you need to implement these with a client. You or your client should contact the agency first; walking in unannounced with firearms could be mistaken as a threat. Some agencies will pick up the firearms at the person’s home. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required. Most agencies offer disposal services, if that is desired. Gun Shops: Some gun shops offer storage services, and a few specialize in this service (e.g., provide pick-up services, offer discounts for longer-term and multiple gun storage). Prices vary, although some shops will provide regular customers with free storage when there is a safety concern. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required, depending on the type of storage the shop uses. Pawn Shops: Pawning guns for a small loan amount can be a relatively low-cost, secure storage option in most states. Interest charges must be paid monthly. To reclaim their firearms, gun owners must repay the loan and go through a background check to verify they are not prohibited from owning firearms. Clients and family members who decide to store their firearms away from their house usually want to know when it’s safe enough to bring their firearms back into the home. \"Yes. … It’s a case-by-case decision based on how the client is doing. Acute suicidal feelings can spike episodically. While these spikes are often brief, they can recur. It is prudent to wait until there has been a relatively long period of stability before returning the guns.\" Temporary storage of firearms away from the home cannot always be arranged immediately and isn’t always acceptable to the client or others in the home. Store in a gun safe or lock box: Lock guns, unloaded, in a gun safe or lock box. Many gun owners have multiple guns and ALL of them should be locked up, including rifles and self-defense guns. Remove a component: Remove a key component of the guns (such as the slides or firing pins) and lock them up - or better yet, store them away from the home. Use Gun Locks: Trigger locks, cable locks, and clamshell locks aren't as safe as locking in a secure gun safe, but they are better than not locking it at all - and when used in conjunction with a safe, can provide an additional layer of protection. Change the Combination or Key: If guns are already locked, change the combination or key location in case the person at risk knows how to access them. Remove Ammunition: Remove ammunition from ALL firearms. Keep all ammunition out of the home for now - or, at least, locked separately. Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.\nWe recommend triple safety when storing them in the home: Locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked up separately (Ideally away from the home while the client is at risk)\nWhat About a Self-Defense Gun? In some situations, clients or members of their household may want to keep their gun available for self-defense purposes. If this is the case, how you approach the situation and what you say will depend on whether the gun owner or the household member is the person at risk. Person At Risk: If the gun owner is the person at risk: Discuss the specific threats that are a concern to the client and the realistic risk of home invasion crimes.\nFind out what other means of protection they would consider, such as self-defense sprays (if legal in your state), flood lights, an alarm system, or a dog.\nDiscuss what they are willing to do to keep themselves safe from suicide.&nbsp;\nWould the client consider locking a self-defense gun and having another family member hold the key? If there’s resistance, consider creative solutions, such as putting pictures of loved ones or other reminders of reasons to live on their gun or lock box to interrupt or slow down a suicidal impulse. Work toward additional steps to reduce access over time. Household Member: If the gun owner is a member of the household: First, discuss the probabilities of suicide attempt versus risk of home invasion in the near term (i.e., the risk of a violent home invasion is very small for most people and is dwarfed by the far greater risk of suicide if a despairing person has a gun close at hand)\nIf the gun owner is concerned about protecting family members, it may be helpful to mention that part of protecting them is keeping everyone safe from suicide.\nIf self-defense is determined to be essential, one option is for the gun owner to keep the firearm either on them or in a quick-release handgun safe to which the person at risk has no access. Overdose accounts for roughly two-thirds of suicide attempts treated in the hospital, but only a very small proportion (2% or less) prove fatal. However, some medications are more dangerous than others, especially when taken in combination. With over 250,000 attempts annually, at least 5,000 people die each year from an intentional overdose. According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the medications most frequently involved in overdose suicides are opioids (e.g., prescription pain medications such as oxycodone, methadone, and morphine). 5&nbsp; In suicide deaths by drug overdose, over half tested positive for an opioid. 6&nbsp;Opioids, when used alone or in combination with other types of drugs or alcohol can cause death by depressing the respiratory system. Other drugs that are frequently implicated in overdose deaths include benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolytics and muscle relaxants), antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping pills (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially diphenhydramine—Benadryl), and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). These substances usually do not appear alone but rather in combination with an opioid, with one another, and/or with alcohol. Alcohol use can increase the lethality of an overdose and may increase the risk that the person will carry through with an attempt.\nUnfortunately, information about lethal combinations of medications is readily available on the Internet. Safely dispose of all unneeded and outdated medication in the home. Opioids should not be kept at home unless absolutely necessary to manage pain. If opioids must be kept at home, they should be locked and inaccessible to the person at risk. If the at-risk client must take the opioids to manage pain, discuss the possibility of having another household member or support person dispense the pills. In high-risk situations involving opioid use, also keep at least two doses of Narcan Nasal Spray, which is a highly effective rescue drug that lay people can administer. When used in time, Narcan can immediately reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Always lock up abuse-prone drugs such as prescription painkillers, anxiety medications, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Many inexpensive lock boxes can easily be broken into. A steel toolbox secured by a padlock is a safe, inexpensive option. For other necessary medications (both over-the-counter and prescription), only keep on hand limited quantities that would not constitute a serious danger if taken together. Lock up the rest. Advise families to ask their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what constitutes a safe quantity of medication to have in their home. The Poison Control Hotline at 800-222-1222 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) can also provide guidance on safe quantities. A family member or support person should seek this information, not the person at risk for suicide, since the information could be used to increase the lethality of an attempt. Use lower-toxicity rather than higher-toxicity medications, if possible, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant rather than a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant. Limit medication to quantities and combinations that, even if taken all at once, will not do serious harm. Consider requiring weekly refills to reduce lethality and increase contact.\nTake into account the client's use of alcohol and other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. Some combinations are more deadly than others. If you have a client with a prescription for psychiatric medications, choose your words carefully so that you don’t send mixed messages or inadvertently inform the person about the lethality of the medications. If a client’s suicidal thoughts focus on methods other than guns or medications, incorporate those methods into your lethal means counseling. For example, if ideation focuses on filling the garage with car exhaust or crashing the car into a telephone pole, and the client has strong suicidal feelings, discuss ways to limit access to the car, such as having a family member hold onto the car keys temporarily.\nWhat if ideation focuses on a certain method? There are times when a client’s ideation focuses on a very specific method that serves as their escape plan and may also have personally significant meaning. For example, your client carries around a belt that he could use to hang himself like his uncle did. If ideation focuses in this very specific way on one particular item, work with the client on agreeing to give up that item for now, while identifying strategies for staying alive. What about methods that cannot easily be restricted at home? Sometimes a client’s ideation focuses on suffocation or other highly lethal methods that are nearly impossible to control access to. These clients may need close supervision from family, friends, or others to ensure they don’t attempt suicide, particularly if their suicidality is of a more chronic or recurring nature. The client may opt to stay in a hospital if they feel the supervision would be helpful. Just One Part of a Safety Plan: In all cases, reducing access to lethal means should be part of a broader collaborative safety plan aimed at helping a client learn how to cope with suicidal feelings, as well as part of a broader therapeutic plan aimed at reducing the reasons for dying and increasing the reasons to live. To reduce access to firearms, the safest option is to store them away from the home. Possible storage options include with a relative or friend; with law enforcement; in a self-storage rental unit; or at a gun shop, shooting range, or pawn shop.\nTo reduce access to firearms that are stored in the home, use triple safety measures: Lock all firearms (or disassemble guns and lock a critical component), unload all firearms, and lock ammunition separately (or don’t keep ammunition at home for now).\nHiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.\nGuns that are kept at home for self-defense must be addressed since they are usually the ones that are most accessible. To reduce access to medications, remove unneeded medications from the home; keep only non-lethal quantities on hand; and lock up abuse-prone drugs, such as prescription painkillers, anxiety pills, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Discuss ways to reduce access to any method a client mentions using. Since escalation to a suicidal crisis can happen rapidly, the goal is to make the home safer for clients at risk before they are actively suicidal. Counseling on access to lethal means is for three types of clients:\nClients who have recently had suicidal thoughts.\nClients who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress. Clients who are struggling with a difficult mental health or substance abuse issue, particularly when they are also coping with a life crisis, such as relationship breakup, housing dislocation, arrest, or financial or job problems. These clients may not be currently suicidal but could become suicidal quickly. Routinely discus ways to reduce access to firearms and medications routinely with any client at risk of suicide. In addition, discuss any other method that a client with suicidal ideation considers using. Lethal means counseling is a client-centered intervention, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Your approach and the language you use are important to making this conversation effective, whether speaking to your client or to their friends and family members. Have a collaborative conversation and work together. With this approach, the client is the expert and the clinician is a resource. Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis as well as the need to reduce access to lethal means. Make specific and feasible plans. Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences. A guiding approach that is collaborative and client-centered is usually best, such as that used in motivational interviewing. Seek input from the client about their own reasons for - and against - reducing access, their own safety concerns, and what they would be willing to do. A collaborative approach accepts the client's values and works from the client's own motivations. \"I can see how hard this has been for you lately, and I'm concerned about you. Are you concerned too?\"\n\"What ideas do you have about ways to increase your safety in case you experience suicidal thoughts?\" If your client is a gun owner: \"Lots of people have guns at home. Some will store their guns outside of their home temporarily - such as at a relative's house or a gun shop - until they are feeling better. What do you think about a strategy like that?\" A directive approach has a less collaborative tone and puts the clinician in the role of the expert. With certain clients, this approach may be more appropriate, for example: Clients who are too overwhelmed or stressed to make clear-headed decisions. Clients from certain cultures who may feel more comfortable getting advice rather than being asked for their ideas. Examples of Directive Statements: \"I'm going to recommend that for now you store your guns away from home. Is that something you can do?\"\n\"You'd be safer if you stored your guns away from home for now.\"\n\"I'm going to suggest you use this gun lock and have your wife keep the key.\"\n\"It would be best if you kept only a week's supply of medications at home and had a family member store the rest.\"\n\"For now, let's have your partner store your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in a lock box.\" No Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts: Some clients may disclose that they are suffering but say they are not suicidal. This may well be true for some clients; however, others may in fact be suicidal or likely to become so. If the client is having a very difficult time, and especially if life stressors are also present (e.g., custody battle, painful breakup, upcoming prison sentence, housing dislocation, work troubles), engage them in a conversation about reducing access to firearms and medications in case suicidal feelings develop.\nExamples of how to respond to clients who say they are not suicidal: \"I'm glad you're not feeling suicidal right now. Sometimes people who are struggling may have a crisis and suddenly experience strong suicidal feelings. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but if it does, I want to be sure you make it through safely and get the help you need. Can we talk over a plan, just in case?\" When clients you suspect are suicidal don't disclose: \"It's not unusual for people who have experienced the kind of pain you are going through recently to feel like it will last forever and to think they would rather be dead. Can we talk over a plan for how you'd stay safe if you started feeling suicidal?\" Some clients, even if they are suicidal, may express resistance to reducing access to lethal means, like firearms. If clients or family members seem resistant, listen to what they say and work collaboratively toward solutions that address their concerns. For instance, some gun owners find the idea of living without a firearm in the home, even temporarily, very difficult. Don’t minimize that this may be a difficult decision. Examples on how to respond to clients who are in denial or resistant: When clients won't tell you whether they have a gun: Will you tell me what you’re worried would happen if you say you have a gun? I may be able to ease those worries. When clients think you are trying to take their gun away: \"I am not questioning your right to own guns. Since you’ve talked about feeling suicidal, I’m concerned about helping you stay safe. Have you also been concerned?” When clients are concerned about what will go in their record: “Before we talk about your specific situation, I can let you know what sort of information I will write down and what I can omit.” When a client is concerned about chronic pain: “I hear that you are concerned you won’t have access to your medications during a flare-up. Let’s come up with a plan that supports both your health and safety.” When a family member is resistant to safely storing medications at home: “While it is true your child could get pills from a store, most suicide attempts occur at home with little or no preparation. Let’s talk about a plan that addresses your concerns and also ensures your daughter cannot take enough pills to harm herself.” Conversations about reducing access to lethal means are not always straightforward or easy. This can be especially true when discussing firearms. As a clinician, if you own guns you may feel more at ease raising the topic and more knowledgeable about storage options. If you aren’t a gun owner, it’s possible you might feel uneasy broaching the topic or overestimate client resistance. However, most gun owners value firearm safety and protecting their family—values that dovetail well with preventing suicide. When firearms are a family tradition and bonding experience: Consider alternatives\nDiscuss safety\nStore guns elsewhere When guns provide safety and protection: Weigh concerns: Weigh the safety concerns of suicidality versus the concern of temporarily not having a firearm at home. Consider other options: Consider other things that could help keep the family safe such as pepper spray, alarms, or outdoor motion-detector lighting. Prioritize client's health: Underscore that part of protecting the client's family is ensuring the client is alive and well. Discuss behavioral history: Ask about any history of impulsive or unexpected behavior, and build on that to reinforce your concern. When guns provide security due to PTSD: Ask how client feels: Ask if the client trusts themselves with a loaded gun close at hand. Consider behavioral strategies: Use a behavioral intervention (e.g. behavioral modification, behavior shaping, rehearsal) or other interventions that focus on taking small steps to reduce access and gradually increasing these steps. Talking to Parents/Guardians: When working with a person under age 18 who is at risk for suicide, involve parents or guardians. Let them know that you are concerned about a possible suicide attempt and explain that reducing access to lethal means can reduce the likelihood of a suicide death.\nWhen the youth has expressed suicidal ideation: “The fact that your child has had suicidal thoughts means we need to take the risk of suicide seriously. We’ve talked about getting him into treatment. I’d also like to talk about steps you can take at home to help keep him safe.”\n\"If a child or teenager attempts suicide, it’s usually at home and it’s often a quick decision. Putting time and distance between them and a method that could do serious harm is one of the single most effective steps to protect your child.\" When the youth is not currently suicidal but at risk: “I’ve asked her about suicidal thoughts, and she hasn’t disclosed any. Suicide is still a concern when kids are struggling. These thoughts can develop rapidly, often without warning, and can prompt an unplanned suicide attempt. Therefore, we routinely suggest a few important steps you can take at home.”\n\"With everything going on in your home right now and the impact on your child, it is best to make the environment in your home safer in case a suicidal crisis occurs unexpectedly. It is safest to temporarily remove all firearms from the home and to reduce access to medications, particularly those for pain and other drugs of abuse, while your child is at risk.\" Since firearms are the leading cause of suicide deaths, be sure to talk with the youth and their parents/guardians about guns in the home. Gather information from youth: Talk to your young clients about whether there are guns in the home and find out if they have access to them.&nbsp;For example, some clinicians ask youth, “How long would it take you to get access to guns in your home?”\nTalk to the parents about gun access and storage:\nSpeak to the adult in the household who is the primary gun owner (unless there are contraindications such as spouse abuse).&nbsp; Find out the following: How are the guns stored in the home? Since gun owners often have more than one, gather information about all of them.\nDoes their child have access to any of the guns in the home? Many parents underestimate their children’s knowledge about where guns are stored and how to access them (e.g., key or combination).&nbsp;\nAre there other homes where the youth stays that may have guns? Discuss all possibilities, such as joint custody situations, relatives, hunting buddies, or other friends.\nMake sure the youth cannot hear your discussion (even if it is by phone), especially if there’s a chance the child is unaware of household firearms. Explain the focus on firearms, if necessary: If parents ask why you are focusing on firearms, explain that they are the most lethal method of suicide and that unlike nearly every other method, there’s no opportunity for the person to change their mind or be rescued mid-attempt. Since suicidal feelings are often short-lived and can come on unpredictably, putting time and distance between an at-risk youth and firearms is an effective way to protect them. Lethal means counseling is client-oriented. When discussing lethal means with clients or family members, make it a collaborative conversation. Your approach and the language you use matters. A collaborative, guiding approach is usually best. A more directive approach is less collaborative but may be more appropriate with certain clients. When working with a young person at risk for suicide, always involve parents or guardians. Together with your client, collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means. Depending on the client’s situation, this plan usually covers firearms and medications, as well as any other methods that are the focus of your client’s ideation.\nThe plan should include the following: Clear roles and tasks: Who will do what (this is especially important to do if others are involved) A timetable: When each part of the plan will be done Family members may not be aware that suicide attempts usually occur with little or no planning and that the method a person chooses often depends on its availability. It can be helpful to inform family members or significant others and to enlist their support in reducing access to lethal means, for example, if there are medications which the client must access daily or occasionally. Benefits: Involving family can be very effective. In fact, families counseled to remove or secure lethal means are far more likely to do so than those who are not counseled. Additionally, results of a pilot study indicate the majority of families reported that the counseling they received was respectful of their needs. Considerations: Some clients will not want you to enlist the help of their family members. In these situations, close friends or peer mentors may be more acceptable and less risky to involve than family members. Collaborate with your client on who would be best to engage.\n- Permission:\n- Ask your client for permission to talk with others before doing so (e.g., spouse, romantic partner, parents, friends, or peer mentors). For minors (under age 18), you may talk to the parents or legal guardian without the client’s permission. To help maintain your relationship with a minor, however, be sure to inform your client before speaking with a parent or guardian.\n- Permission Denied:\n- If a client does not give you permission to talk with anyone, yet you believe that removal of a lethal means is necessary for the safety of that individual, this could be considered permissible communication. Consult the current HIPAA guidelines for situations like this.\n- Remember, in order to collaborate effectively with a client (or their parents), the clinician should:\n- Use language that indicates acceptance of gun ownership without judgement.\n- Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis and the need to reduce access to lethal means.\n- Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences, recognizing that gun owners tend to prefer language that emphasizes options and autonomy. Consider the Client's Reaction: Before finalizing a plan to reduce access to firearms, or any suicide method, consider your client's reactions to it and the likelihood of follow-through with the plan. If you are working with the parents or guardians of youth, take their reactions into consideration. The client’s (or parents’) response may reveal whether the plan is likely to be carried out. Examples: Initial reluctance from client: Is your client initially reluctant to implement the plan and then relieved when they agree? This may indicate strong commitment to that particular method and a positive indication that, for now at least, they are electing to live. Readily agreeable client: If your client readily agrees to give up access to means and puts up no resistance, you may need to be a little suspicious. Sometimes lack of resistance means that the person is already considering a substitute method or holding something back. For example, the client may be thinking, “Okay, now that I don’t have guns, I’ll just use pills.” If you have doubts, say something like, “Thank you for your help on this. Now I’m wondering what other means you’ve considered and if those means are available to you.” Mixed messages from family members: If you are working with family members and one member is agreeable but the gun-owning family member seems reluctant, this may indicate a lack of commitment by the gun owner to follow through with the plan. Monitor Progress: Document and Monitor: Once you've arrived at a mutually acceptable plan for reducing access to lethal means, document it in your notes. Access to lethal means: For all persons identified at risk for suicide, indicate that you have assessed for specific access to lethal means. Recommendations and Steps: List any recommendations and steps agreed upon with the client to reduce access to lethal means and make the environment safer. Contact with Others: Indicate if you contacted family members or a support person to confirm the removal or securing of lethal means. If the client or family has engaged law enforcement, a pharmacy, or others to hold or dispose of lethal means, this should be documented in the medical records. One way to ensure that lethal means counseling becomes a standard component of working with people at risk of suicide is, where possible, to build prompts into electronic templates and paper forms that serve as a reminder. For example, systems that use electronic medical records can embed specific lethal means documentation into templates for intake assessments, crisis appointments, therapy or medication appointments, and many other appointment types. Recommendations for Follow-Up: Never assume that the agreed-on plan will go as intended. Follow-up is essential. Suggestions for monitoring progress: Make follow-up calls Call to check on progress and assess how the client is doing. Or ask the client or family member to contact you when they've carried out the tasks in the plan. Continue to assess suicide risk: Assess and monitor your client's risk of suicide on an ongoing basis. Things can improve or deteriorate rapidly. Return to discussions of means reduction as needed. Adapt plan Make any necessary changes to the plan if the client's situation changes. For instance, if a client moves out of their current home and in with a friend, the plan would need to be updated for the new living situation, and the friend would need to be collaboratively engaged in the plan. Encourage close supervision Encourage family, relatives, and friends to provide closer supervision since clients may struggle with their moods or have episodes of suicidal thoughts interspersed with stretches of feeling okay. Key Points: Collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means and enlist the support of family and friends. Agree on roles and timetable.\nDocument the plan in your notes and monitor progress. Continue to monitor the client's suicide risk as treatment continues. Update the plan to reduce means, as needed.

We really appreciate that.\" Validates and shows you’ve heard the client\nMirror back what you’re hearing is going on • Allow further explanation of the concern by not inserting your opinion\nListen for feelings, themes, motivations, unmet need “It sounds like you’ve had a really tough time.”\n“You’re really angry about what’s happened.” “You’re ____.” Insert any emotion—“mad,” “upset,” “frustrated,” “worried,” etc. You can’t do it wrong! “Sounds like…”\n“Seems like…”\n“It feels like…”\n“To you, it looks like…”\n“I am hearing…”\n“I am wondering if…” Help transition the client to resolution: “So you’ve been through a lot and you’re really upset about everything that’s happened before. It sounds like we need to get you in to talk to someone. Would it be okay to get you scheduled for an appointment?”\n“The last time you were here, you thought you got the run around and didn’t have time to see the provider.

for Working with High Conflict Couples","icon":"","description":"\nWhy are couples behaving so badly? \"The average couple waits 6 years before seeking out therapy.\" (Gottman) In those 6 years there is: Build up of resentments\nReinforced bad habits\nNo boundary enforcement\nErosion of positive perspective\nUnconscious bias kicks - assumptions about purposeful poor behavior choices\nMissed bids for attention\nDepletion of emotional bank account\nNever had any positive role models to begin with From a survey conducted in September 2020: Increases in substance misuse: Alcohol (88%)\nMarijuana (37%)\nPrescription Opioids (15%) Domestic violence cases increased by 25%-33% globally. How are these influences showing up in the clients in the therapy room? Passive/aggressive behaviors\nShut down/Withdrawn/Stonewalling\nWithholding Sex or Avoiding Intimacy\nNarcissistic Behavior Responses\nGaslighting\nAnger\nHigh Conflict\nBoundary Crossing\nPersistent and Ongoing Flooding\nUnwilling to Repair/Apologize/Take Responsibility How to prepare yourself for the unexpected: When you open your office door, look for body language and non-verbals. Have confidence and KNOW that you are the expert in the room. Own it and be brave. Set the tone at the beginning of the session when you feel something is off. Let the clients know what you feel when you feel it, and be willing to talk about what is happening. (Do not wait for clients to bring it up or ignore it)\nModel for your couples that you are going to talk about it, not let things be passive-aggressive or avoid dealing with hot topics. Remind clients who escalate that they are not in therapy to repeat old patterns. Pause and interrupt when you see unacknowledged emotion happening in the room. That is your job. Don't let your couples argue or verbally explode on each other. They can do that at home for free. Take Control. Develop your phrase to create stop-action with clients. Say things like, 'pause, stop,' or call out your client's name, etc. Be direct. What is acceptable and what is not acceptable about words or behavior in the room. What you would like your clients to do instead (as for their positive need). Why it's not okay for them to say or do the thing that you witnessed in the room. Let the clients know how painful it is for you to witness, so you can't imagine what it's like for their partner. Keep your eyes on each client in the room. Are you letting one partner high jack the session? Stop the speaking partner and ask, 'What's coming up for you?' Notice if the other partner checks in. Be mindful of the need to stop and tend to the party not speaking. This is how you keep explosions from getting out of control because you have been checking in on what is happening on the other side of the couch. Step in for clients when they don't have words and find a way to speak their pain to their partner. Keep it fair, so both partners feel you are connected with their pain, needs, and wanted outcomes. Normalize high emotion and disappointment of partner not being able to acknowledge perspectives not because they don't love you. Differences on family of origin, difference in expectations, etc. Prior traumas and life experiences make it hard for partners to always regulate their emotions in ways they would hope. Untreated mental health issues impact ability to manage emotions. Not finished working on the 'Me' stuff versus the 'We' stuff and bleeding over into our relationship. Discuss the impact of substances and the impact it has on being able to manage emotions. Gottman Method: Flooding is expected because partners are experiencing physiological arousal. Utilize pulse oximeters to help validate their elevated heart rate. Be okay with breaking it up. Sometimes you need to have one couple leave the room while you do some one-on-one with the other partner. Let an explosive partner leave if they want. Don't chase them or try to convince them to stay or come back. Talk about the flooding in the room and share ways to help self-regulate, like taking deep breaths or pausing to find ways to reframe. You need to be prepared when working with couples that you might need to a break from couples therapy or stop all together based on how the clients present. This is your call as a therapist to evaluate if working with the couple is contraindicated because of co-occurring mental health, substance, unresolved trauma, suicidal ideation, personality disorders, characterological DV, or anger management issues. Often necessary to request that clients seek out individual therapy to strengthen their individual coping skills before attempting additional couples' therapy. Expect your clients to disagree and give you pushback. Attitude is everything in this conversation. Remember, your clients are not your peers, and we often have to make unpopular decisions about the course of care. When you feel anxious and flooded as the therapist: Notice where you are breathing. Plant both feet on the floor. Take your shoulders back against your chair, take a deep breath into your belly, and repeat to yourself: \"This is not my pain to feel.\" Get in touch with your client's inner 5-year-old old in the room. What is hurting them, and what is the catastrophe scenario that is playing out for them?\nWhen I de-escalate, so do my clients. When my voice gets softer and quieter, so does my clients, and they can often match my tone and calm demeanor. Don't shy away from acknowledging they have the right to feel upset, and it makes sense they would be even if their partner does not agree. Ask their partner to find something they said that they can validate for their partner. Remind them this is not the same as agreeing. Focus on the behavior or the words you heard. We can help facilitate meaningful conversation about the emotions each partner is feeling. Ask the partner who is feeling a big emotion related to their partner to name their emotion. Then talk the behavior they say their partner do or the words they heard them say. Remind and monitor clients to avoid telling their partner their evaluation of why their partner did it or the mind set they were in when it happened. This often happens and only creates defensiveness in their partner. No one likes to be told how they feel. Ask for your positive need. Even if the answer is no - you need to hear yourself asking for your need. Gottman Method Stress Reducing Conversation 10-minutes each partner. Listening for understanding and share emotion. (Not problem-solving)\nHow do clients know it's working? Does your partner feel hear and understood? Then yes. Use of open-ended questions to help partners attune, connect, and provide empathy and support. Questions that allow for each partner to draw out their partner's experience, such as: \"What is this like for you? What do you need? What don't you like about this situation?\" Gottman Method Dreams within Conflict Asks clients to suspend problem-solving so they can have a better understanding of the childhood stories, values, or core ethics and beliefs that keep their partner rooted in their perspective. Clients take turns asking each partner a set of questions so they can better experience what it's like to walk in their partner's shoes. Preparation for compromise like partners who love each other. Gottman Method Injuries Exercise Helps partners find a structured and safe format to talk about old injuries in a way that helps facilitate compassion, acceptance, and understand about prior and shared traumas.\nCreates awareness and insight about the impact and ways these traumas have shaped the way each partner views their world.\nHelps evaluate how clients have learned to cope and survive. Can help some clients gain insight on how they behave in relationships in ways that no longer serve them.\nHelps couples therapist normalize and make recommendations of ways those old injuries get triggered in the relationship and behavior changes that might be beneficial. Gottman Method Appreciations Exercise Changes tone and energy in session.\nAllows each partner to find something positive to notice about their partner to demonstrate holding each other from a positive perspective.\nMakes deposits into each partner’s emotional bank account.\nStarts conversations about how to do small things often in the relationship for highly disconnected couples.\nWay to end session, so couples can ground before leaving in turmoil. If apologies are made, they are often expressed as implying you misunderstood something but without remorse for poor behaviors\nOutside behaviors or the other person is ALWAYS the source of conflict or turn it around on the other person implying they are really the culprit for the issue\nSelf-doubt creeps in and the partner being gaslit internalizes their lack of hard work in the relationship as the cause of all the problems.\nGuilt develops about bringing up issues in the relationship.\nIt feels very much like the result of narcissistic behavior responses.\nThe partner who is doing the gaslighting may do so unconsciously to gain control or power in the relationship when they feel out of resources or support.\nManipulation that involves making someone question their own reality, feelings, and experiences of events, in order to maintain CONTROL over that person. Deflecting the other person by use of lack of acknowledgement, negative body language, and minimizing statements about the other person’s perspective or feelings. Unwillingness to accept any part of the responsibility for a misunderstanding or conflict. Intentional implication that the other person is over-reacting or has fabricated a situation in order to create doubt or challenge the other person’s reality Being cut off from making points, asking questions, or providing input during a disagreement. No acknowledgment of your hurt feelings when expressed. Lacks Empathy.\nClients are often overly invested in using narcissist label with each other. Only 5% of population are diagnosable with narcissistic personality disorder\nYou should be aware that most clients who have diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder are not going to be served in couples therapy and may be contra-indicated. Gottman Interventions to Bring into Session Introduces the idea that anything our partner does for us is a gift - they are not required to do so because we are in a relationship with each other.\nSoftened Start Up: This is helpful for the narcissistic leaning partner to learn how to be clear in their needs and learn how to share why it is important to them. This helps them to slowly understand they are not entitled to anything. Appreciations: Help the narcissistic partner to think about what the other person adds to their life and to acknowledge it. Accept the things you can't change. Helpful for both partners to understand there are some things that are unlikely to ever completely be different in their dynamics. Helps partners make a choice about the relationship from that space of acceptance. Aftermath of a Regrettable Incident: Introduction to Narcissistic person about their role in feeling disrespected or unappreciated. Active listening exercises like the Gottman-Rapport You must interrupt patterns of rage, repeated interruptions, storming off, or screaming. Be on the lookout for a partner who has NPD to be overly charming or makes big declarations of victimhood, or says their only goal is “to fight for the relationship.” Avoid becoming a victim of triangulation or becoming caught up in buying into the hope that you can fix the narcissistic behaviors. You MUST be comfortable being direct, holding a strong position of authority in the room, and be willing to call out poor behavior that is impacting the relationship. Strongly suggest and sometimes require that both partners be in individual therapy and check in with this therapist to make sure they are aware of the dynamics happening in the relationship. The only goal you may accomplish is validating the victim that they are correct in their reality and that they can trust their intuition. You may serve as the objective voice this person needs to get clear and end the relationship. Don’t fight, argue, or try to overpower the narcissist.\nThere is a very strong likelihood that despite your support that these sessions may not go as you hope! Many clients who have narcissistic behaviors can and will use the tools they learn in session to abuse, further manipulate, or weaponize against their partner. True NPD will NOT be ok with the change in or loss of power and will retaliate. Evaluate if the partner is becoming more agitated, aggressive, and if you suspect there is an increased likelihood for physical abuse-stop sessions. Recognize you can and potentially should take a break from therapy with the couples. Should you refer them to seek individual therapy for a while and then re-evaluate if they are good candidates for couples therapy? Couples therapy can re-traumatize the partner who is being victimized. Consider if this is in the scope of your practice? Do you need to refer out? Make time before letting clients go to let them know that it was a hard session and how important it was to have it. Let your partner know that if they are flooded when they will come back and talk about it with you. Make a date with each other to come back and process. Check in with each partner about what they will do to self-soothe. Remind clients that emotions and feeling hurt or misunderstood happens in relationships. The couple is not in this situation because they don’t love each other but because the stakes are so high. This is your person and if we are not ok then nothing feels ok. Let them know you are proud of them for doing the work.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Preparation:","level":2,"id":"Preparation_0"},{"heading":"Intention:","level":2,"id":"Intention_0"},{"heading":"Boundaries when Couples Escalate","level":2,"id":"Boundaries_when_Couples_Escalate_0"},{"heading":"Understanding Each Partner","level":2,"id":"Understanding_Each_Partner_0"},{"heading":"Using Theory to Psychoeducate Couples","level":2,"id":"Using_Theory_to_Psychoeducate_Couples_0"},{"heading":"Diffuse","level":2,"id":"Diffuse_0"},{"heading":"Evaluate if the Couple is Ready for Therapy","level":2,"id":"Evaluate_if_the_Couple_is_Ready_for_Therapy_0"},{"heading":"Self-Check-In","level":2,"id":"Self-Check-In_0"},{"heading":"Be Curious vs. Furious","level":2,"id":"Be_Curious_vs._Furious_0"},{"heading":"HELPFUL Interventions in Session and Beyond","level":2,"id":"HELPFUL_Interventions_in_Session_and_Beyond_0"},{"heading":"Gaslighting (Impacts and Behaviors)","level":2,"id":"Gaslighting_(Impacts_and_Behaviors)_0"},{"heading":"Behaviors","level":3,"id":"Behaviors_0"},{"heading":"Interventions to Work with Narcissistic 'Behaviors'","level":2,"id":"Interventions_to_Work_with_Narcissistic_'Behaviors'_0"},{"heading":"Best Ways to Carry Yourself in Session with Narcissistic Personality Disorder Clients","level":2,"id":"Best_Ways_to_Carry_Yourself_in_Session_with_Narcissistic_Personality_Disorder_Clients_0"},{"heading":"Take Time at End of Session to Reframe What Happened","level":2,"id":"Take_Time_at_End_of_Session_to_Reframe_What_Happened_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/training/strategies-for-working-with-high-conflict-couples.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1707247704840,"modifiedTime":1742962379449,"sourceSize":14678,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Training/Strategies for Working with High Conflict Couples.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/training/strategies-for-working-with-high-conflict-couples.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/ecr-sf-scoring.html":{"title":"ECR-SF Scoring","icon":"","description":"\nResults consist of two scores for the two separate factors; Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.

During pre-sessioning you should decide on the following: The intention or goals for the session\nAgreement on a theoretical model\nCreate a session specific game plan\nDiscuss previous sessions, hypotheses, and evaluation of progress\nMake decisions about next steps in treatment You should also consider the following questions amongst yourself: What would blow you out of the water?\nWhat would be so shocking that you wouldn't know what to do?\nLet's brainstorm what we would do if XYZ occurred in session Examples (arguing, escalation, high conflict, desire to end relationship, risk, etc.) How would you manage that?\nWhat do you anticipate?\nWhat is your theory of what's going on--your theory of the problem? Strategies for the therapy room As a co-therapy team you should determine which strategies you are going to use in the room. What is the role of each therapist and how will you work together. Some strategies to consider: Tag team One starts speaking, while the other would be writing questions, and perhaps nodding occasionally, or making validating and summarizing statements.\nThen, when number one (i.e. the one who was speaking) runs out number two is ready. They're ready, because they've been writing questions, and they can jump in with those questions. Preparation and sharing airtime Who will do what in the session? Who is handling assessment or genogram?\nWill we ever spend time one on one or break up subsystems of the client system?\nSplit the joining tasks\nBefore you go into the room, you decide which member of the couple each therapist will focus on with joining. For example: You're going to join with the husband, and I'm going to join with the wife.\nIt's very specific who we're each validating, empathizing, and summarizing. If you start asking questions of the husband, it's my job to ask the follow-up questions of the wife. In the same vein with the wife, so that we're like two advocates. Reflecting Team As co-therapists there may be times when you find it appropriate to turn to one another and talk about what is going on or what you notice in the room. This could be used as an intervention or to help determine the next steps in the session.\nExample: Co-therapists turn to one another and debate or argue about what is happening with the client system. Have a discussion or debate about what is going on, and then turn back to the couple and say, \"Where are we going wrong?, or \"How are we getting it right?\" ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Pre-Sessioning","level":2,"id":"Pre-Sessioning_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1710692239441,"modifiedTime":1742962384026,"sourceSize":2735,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Preparing for Co-Therapy.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/questions-for-clients.html":{"title":"Questions for Clients","icon":"","description":"\nQuestions for both: What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?\nCan you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?\nWhat role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?\nCan you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy? Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first): Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. (Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)\nAsk them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement. Now work with the leaning-in partner: Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. Summary statement: Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?\nWhat do you think the problem is now?\nHow will you know when the problem is solved?\nHow will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?\nWhat will have to be different about others involved in the situation?\nWhat is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?\nWhat needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?\nOften in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today? So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?\nWhat is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?\nWhat would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen? What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?\nWhat changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? How have you managed to cope, ensure, keep going? What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope?

This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Cognition\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Cognition\">#Cognition</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Development\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Development\">#Development</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Emotion\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Emotion\">#Emotion</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Motivation\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Motivation\">#Motivation</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Peers\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Peers\">#Peers</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Prefrontal-Cortex\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Prefrontal-Cortex\">#Prefrontal-Cortex</a> <br><img alt=\"Neurobiological Models of Adolescence.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/neurobiological-models-of-adolescence.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe dual-system based largely on Metcalf &amp; Mischel's (1999) two-system model of willpower.

The hot system is emotionally driven by fears, desires, and reflexes. The balance between these two system varies as a function of the individual, development, and stress.

T.; Journal: Journal of Family Psychology, Volume: 36,\nIssue: 2\nPages: 179-190\nYear: 2022 DOI: 10.1037/fam0000918\nISSN: 1939-1293, 0893-3200\nThis qualitative interview study investigated the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages received by Multiracial American youth over the course of their development. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Multiracial\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Multiracial\">#Multiracial</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Biracial\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Biracial\">#Biracial</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Qualitative\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Qualitative\">#Qualitative</a> It was not until 1967 that interracial marriages became legal across the US with the Loving v. Virginia case. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18. There is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families. Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict. <br><a data-href=\"Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)</a> <br><a data-href=\"Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation</a> Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.\nThis model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development. Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.\nMultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status. Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth: Cultural Socialization Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. Racial Identity Socialization Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves. Preparation for Bias Messages Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. Egalitarian Socialization Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same Negative Socialization Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial Exposure to Diversity Messages Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. No Racial-Ethnic Socialization Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews Racial Identity Socialization\nPreparation for Bias Socialization\nColorblind Socialization\nDiversity Appreciation Socialization\nRace-Conscious Socialization\nExposure to Diversity Socialization\nNegative Socialization\nSilent Socialization Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture. Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures. Language Socialization There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group. Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned. \"You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such.\" Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them. Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.\nOne way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go.

Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson’s theory and Marcia’s identity status model, but process-oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents ﬁnd a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well-being.\nKeywords: Need to Read\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Identity Formation in Adolescence: The Dynamic of Forming and Consolidating Identity Commitments","level":1,"id":"Identity_Formation_in_Adolescence_The_Dynamic_of_Forming_and_Consolidating_Identity_Commitments_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@crocettiidentityformationadolescence2017.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1738791930425,"modifiedTime":1738791930429,"sourceSize":1453,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic–racial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‐seated ethnic–racial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic–racial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic–racial socialization in this decade. Furthermore, although it is clear that family ethnic–racial socialization is a robust predictor of youths' adjustment, the associations between socialization and adjustment must be considered with attention to specific socialization strategies, the confluence of strategies used, and the unique contexts within which families' lives are embedded.\nKeywords: Need to Read\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Ethnic–Racial Socialization in the Family: A Decade's Advance on Precursors and Outcomes","level":1,"id":"Ethnic–Racial_Socialization_in_the_Family_A_Decade's_Advance_on_Precursors_and_Outcomes_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@umana-taylorethnicracialsocialization2020.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1738791721051,"modifiedTime":1738791721056,"sourceSize":1746,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. Example. An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. Example. An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. Example. A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. Clinical implication Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics.

Long-term impact of adolescence While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. Developmental Systems Model This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. This model emphasizes Change and Relative Plasticity Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development Relationism and Integration Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. Historical Embeddedness and Temporality Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. Implications for Research and Application This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions. 'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes. This knowledge will inform effective policies and interventions to maximize the positive potential of adolescence for individuals and society as a whole.

Family Influences","icon":"","description":"I. OverviewThis document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:\nThe impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.\nParental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.\nThe interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.\nThe importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.\nII. Key Themes and FindingsA. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)\nCore Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.\nKey Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.\n\"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)...\"\nSecrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.\nIncreased secrecy is linked to \"stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret.\"\nImplications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.\nB. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)\nCore Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).\nKey Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (ρ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).\nPsychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.\nParental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. \"Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure.\"\nCultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.\nImplications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.\nC. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)\nCore Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.\nKey Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms\nGreater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.\n\"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship.\"\nRacial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety\nImplications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.\nD. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)\nCore Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.\nKey Findings:\"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.\"\nLGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.\nLatino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents\nImplications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.\nIII. Quotes\nFrijns et al. (2010): \"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)...\"\nLiu et al. (2020): \"Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure.\"\nMontoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): \"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship.\"\nRyan et al. (2010): \"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.\"\nIV. Overall ImplicationsThese studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being.

target=\"_self\">https://www.ohiohistory.org/Links to an external site.</a>)!&nbsp;The Ohio History Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society, is a statewide history organization with the mission to spark discovery of Ohio’s stories. As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state’s history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;<br>For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://mozartscafe.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mozartscafe.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart’s brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This \"taste of Austria\" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most \"brilliantly illuminated city in the country.\" Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days. The leaves are falling! Where does the time go.&nbsp;Have a wonderful week, and please reach out to myself or Anna, our TA, if you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerAnother week, another (late) announcement,I hope you are having a great week, we are halfway through, whether that's the semester or the week you decide! This week we will begin to look at the basic patterns of sexual orientation and behavior. We also look at the critiques on sexual attitudes, sex education, and the sexual double standard. By the end of this module, you will be able to answer some questions such as...\nWhat is sexual orientation? How have attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the medical and scientific communities?\nAccording to researchers, what is the role of genetics, evolution, and social environment in determining sexual orientation?\nREMINDER: Please put aside enough time to watch 'How to Lose Your Virginity' (1 hour and 6 minutes) and 'Sex 101' (20 min).&nbsp;<br>In this week's restaurant, I chose Belle's Bread.&nbsp;Tucked away in the Japanese marketplace located on Kenny Centre Mall,&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/\" target=\"_self\">Belle’s BreadLinks to an external site.</a>&nbsp;is a family-owned and -operated, French-inspired Japanese bakery. Takashi Takenaka opened the business after immigrating from Japan in 1972, and he pays homage to childhood treats with his red bean roll, frank roll, and curry and boiled egg doughnuts. The bear-shaped strawberry cream bun is all over social media, but the best-kept secret is the Mont Blanc roll with its layers of delicate, airy sweet cream and chestnuts.&nbsp;<br>In Columbus Lore this week, our amazing student Doug Motz wrote this piece on the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/\" target=\"_self\">AIU &amp; The LeVeque TowerLinks to an external site.</a>. I learned so much information from this article, and it is just one piece of history from our city. Please take a moment to read through this article, if you get the chance. You know that big building that has those beautiful lights displayed at the top? Yup, that's this place! It has gone through it's fair share of history, and many owners. Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!! Just a wonderful piece of history to share with you all.&nbsp;Go outside and play in the leaves, take a moment to breathe. You have done so well, and I am so proud of you! Keep working hard as you always have, and remember to take care of yourself this week. :)Warmest regards,Lynn ReidingerGoooooooood Evening Buckeyes!\nDescribe the contemporary social scrip that characterizes romantic relationship formation for college students and young adults.\nEvaluate how relationship rituals such as texting, hooking up, online dating, datings apps are changing partner selection and intimate relationships.\nDescribe the roles that attraction and attractiveness play in mate selection and define personality characteristics that make someone attractive.\nCritique marital attitudes over the past 150 years and their effect on mate selection.\nOn this week's Columbus lore, I thought I would bring it a little closer to home and look into OSU's history. You know that beautiful building you most likely walk by regularly called University Hall? Well, do I have some interesting facts for you.This was the first classroom building opened in 1873!&nbsp;<br>\n<img alt=\"University Resources/Ohio State History/Ohio State Pictures/University Hall/Announcements.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/university-hall/announcements.png\" target=\"_self\">\n“Announcements-1.png” could not be found.\n“Announcements-2.png” could not be found.<br>\n<img alt=\"Announcements-3.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/university-hall/announcements-3.png\" target=\"_self\">\nOn the first day of classes in September 1873, the students entered an unfinished University Hall. This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.<br>In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today’s University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today’s University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976. (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/\" target=\"_self\">https://library.osu.edu/site/buckeyestroll/university-hall/Links to an external site.</a>)For a random Columbus restaurant, I wanted something close to campus. I chose Emmett's Cafe! This bakery/cafe is located in the Old North.&nbsp;Inspired by Australian coffee culture, Emmett’s is the top pick for morning hangouts with a flat white or cold brew. This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks. Get that pumpkin spice latte for yourself, you deserve that treat! I can't wait to see the leaves falling all over campus.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn Ash (Lynn Reidinger)Hey Class,I apologize for missing our weekly announcement last week, but I was unfortunately not feeling well. We can't skip this week, what if some of you are waiting on this week's Columbus lore? As always, I will have interesting history, activities, and suggested restaurants below.You worked through your midterm, WOO! I am so proud of each of you for getting to this point in the semester. I can't believe we are almost finished. It has been a pleasure getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to each of you that congratulated me on my marriage, and this week seems very fitting!This week we look at marriage and cohabitation. Be mindful as we reflect on diversity, inequality, and social change in terms of marriage. We will consider how marital quality changes across the life course and illustrate the hallmarks of poor marital communication. Do you know what are the predictors of a high quality, satisfying marriage? What specific relationships come to mind when you think of a healthy marriage?This week's assignments are outlined below.

The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps “The Five Brothers,” which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.anthony-thomas.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.anthony-thomas.com/\" target=\"_self\">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!<br><img alt=\"Announcements-7.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAnthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony’s dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony’s son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony’s Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father. Realizing&nbsp;the quality of the candy was creating a demand, Tom and his father decided to make it a full time trade, and using their first names they formed the Anthony-Thomas Candy Company in 1952.Astounding Activities: The Scioto Deer&nbsp;“Announcements-8.png” could not be found.You may have probably seen at least one of the three bronze deer sculptures located throughout Columbus, but do you know why they’re actually there? It’s okay, neither did I. These friendly, relaxed-looking deer were added to the Scioto Mile as part of the big rehabilitation project in 2014 that&nbsp;turned the area into the incredible multi-use park and trail space it is now.There are a total of three deer along the Scioto River admiring the river, and they were put in during the renovation. Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don’t worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;I hope you all have a great week. I should be on tomorrow for our office hours if you may need anything (My office hours are Tuesdays from 1p-2p). Please take some time this week to soak in some sun and enjoy this fall weather. You have worked so hard to get to this point!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshIT'S HALLOWEEN!!!This is my favorite holiday, and it makes me so happy to see people dressed up while walking around campus. Make sure to grab some candy for yourself (... getting it on sale tomorrow does in fact count), and take it easy this week.

The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!“Announcements-9.png” could not be found.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html\" target=\"_self\">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a>On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn’s products.Astounding Activities:&nbsp;“Announcements-10.png” could not be found.<br>For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/\" target=\"_self\">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape.

Mr. Ted has been coming to campus with me, so if you ever see us walking by don't be afraid to say hi!Have a fantastic week!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHi Buckeyes!Though we are not covering anything this week, I wanted to send an announcement out to all of you regarding the event that will take place for each of you tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHappy Tuesday everyone!Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life. We discuss examples of implicit bias and microaggressions and how they impact the individual and family.&nbsp;<br>We will be reading Chapter 3 in Cohen (2020) this week, which is posted under the top module labelled '<a title=\"Textbook Information\" class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/courses/180658/modules/1814602\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Textbook Information</a>.'

For example, several likert-scale questions on a questionnaire observing psychological outcomes may load highly on a ‘depressive/depression’ factor, showing they measure the same underlying construct. Higher values of factor loadings (e.g., &gt; .4 or .5) indicate that a variable is a strong indicator of that factor. Lower values suggest the variable is less relevant to that factor. EFA can allow us to group variables with higher factor loadings on the same factor, reducing the complexity of our data.\n<br><img alt=\"Distance-5.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/distance-5.png\" target=\"_self\">\n3\nThe eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by each factor. If using the eigenvalue cutoff of 1, the cutoff is greater than 1 because the retained factors explain more variance. This can be seen on the Scree plot where there is a point where the slope of the curve changes, which is usually the cutoff for the number of factors we would retain. Factors to the left of the cutoff are considered meaningful. This is why there are only 3 out of the original 12 factors that were extracted from the analysis. The first three factors account for more of the variance in the model.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Please Describe the Difference between Unstandardized and Standardized Coefficients.","level":2,"id":"Please_Describe_the_Difference_between_Unstandardized_and_Standardized_Coefficients._0"},{"heading":"Unstandardized Coefficients (Raw)","level":3,"id":"Unstandardized_Coefficients_(Raw)_0"},{"heading":"Standardized Coefficients (Beta)","level":3,"id":"Standardized_Coefficients_(Beta)_0"},{"heading":"Please Describe Zero-Order Correlations, Partial Correlations, and Semi-Partial Correlations.","level":2,"id":"Please_Describe_Zero-Order_Correlations,_Partial_Correlations,_and_Semi-Partial_Correlations._0"},{"heading":"Zero-Order Correlations","level":3,"id":"Zero-Order_Correlations_0"},{"heading":"Partial Correlations","level":3,"id":"Partial_Correlations_0"},{"heading":"Semi-Partial Correlations","level":3,"id":"Semi-Partial_Correlations_0"},{"heading":"Please Describe the Differences between Simultaneous, Hierarchical, and Stepwise Regression.","level":2,"id":"Please_Describe_the_Differences_between_Simultaneous,_Hierarchical,_and_Stepwise_Regression._0"},{"heading":"Simultaneous Multiple Regression","level":3,"id":"Simultaneous_Multiple_Regression_0"},{"heading":"Hierarchical Multiple Regression","level":3,"id":"Hierarchical_Multiple_Regression_0"},{"heading":"Stepwise Multiple Regression","level":3,"id":"Stepwise_Multiple_Regression_0"},{"heading":"Forward Stepwise Regression","level":4,"id":"Forward_Stepwise_Regression_0"},{"heading":"Backward Stepwise Regression","level":4,"id":"Backward_Stepwise_Regression_0"},{"heading":"What is Yielded When You Square a Semi-Partial Correlation?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Yielded_When_You_Square_a_Semi-Partial_Correlation?_0"},{"heading":"Please Define and Describe the Four Primary Assumptions of Regression","level":2,"id":"Please_Define_and_Describe_the_Four_Primary_Assumptions_of_Regression_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" data-href=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" href=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">MLR</a> in SPSS","level":3,"id":"[[Multiple_Linear_Regression_(MLR)|MLR]]_in_SPSS_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Testing Linearity\" data-href=\"Testing Linearity\" href=\"Testing Linearity\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linearity</a>","level":3,"id":"[[Testing_Linearity|Linearity]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Testing the Independence of Error\" data-href=\"Testing the Independence of Error\" href=\"Testing the Independence of Error\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independence of Error</a>","level":3,"id":"[[Testing_the_Independence_of_Error|Independence_of_Error]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Testing Homoscedasticity\" data-href=\"Testing Homoscedasticity\" href=\"Testing Homoscedasticity\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Homoscedasticity</a>","level":3,"id":"[[Testing_Homoscedasticity|Homoscedasticity]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Testing for Normality\" data-href=\"Testing for Normality\" href=\"Testing for Normality\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Normality</a>","level":3,"id":"[[Testing_for_Normality|Normality]]_0"},{"heading":"Please Define and Describe <a data-href=\"Distance\" href=\"Distance\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Distance</a>, <a data-href=\"Leverage\" href=\"Leverage\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leverage</a>, and <a data-href=\"Influence\" href=\"Influence\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Influence</a>","level":2,"id":"Please_Define_and_Describe_[[Distance]],_[[Leverage]],_and_[[Influence]]_0"},{"heading":"Distance","level":3,"id":"Distance_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Mahalonobis' Distance\" href=\"Mahalonobis' Distance\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahalonobis' Distance</a>","level":4,"id":"[[Mahalonobis'_Distance]]_0"},{"heading":"Standardized Residuals","level":4,"id":"Standardized_Residuals_0"},{"heading":"Leverage","level":3,"id":"Leverage_0"},{"heading":"Influence","level":3,"id":"Influence_0"},{"heading":"What is Meant by a Factor Loading in <a data-href=\"Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)\" href=\"Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)</a>?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Meant_by_a_Factor_Loading_in_[[Exploratory_Factor_Analysis_(EFA)]]?_0"},{"heading":"See the Scree Plot Below.

So, if the p-value of the maximum Mahal distance (Check the 'Residual Statistics Table') is greater than the threshold of .001, you can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictor(s).\nYou do not even have to check the Mahal distance for individual cases. The absolute values of DfFITS (i.e., |SDF_1|) tells us the magnitude of the effect an individual case have on the predicted values. This indicates that, the SDF_1, similar to the Cook's distance, help examine the influence of some cases on the predicted values. Cases with absolute values of DfFITS greater than 2 (i.e., |SDF_1| &gt; 2) should be examined. <br><img alt=\"4.

A case with an DfBeta greater than 2 can be said to have greater influence on the regression parameter in question (Pituch &amp; Stevens, 2016).

Model summary includes the R2 value, which in this case shows a significant amount of variance explained (37.63%) Below, in the 'Model' table, you can see the coefficients for the intercept as well as for the slopes of Dose, Love of Puppies, and the automatically created interaction term. Just below that you see that the interaction term is dose x puppylove<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-15.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-15.png\" target=\"_self\"> This next significant table shows us the conditional effects of W at the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentiles. Here, we see that when puppy love is at the 16 th percentile (puppy love = 1), the effect is 1.81 (p = .0013). Likewise, when puppy love is at the 50 th percentile (2.5), the effect is also significant (p = .0046) at 1.1694. However, the effect is no longer significant at the 84 th percentile for puppy love, (p &gt; .05).<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-16.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-16.png\" target=\"_self\"> The next table is the Johnson-Newman results. The Johnson-Newman approach looks for the values of W, where the p-values of the conditional effect changes to above/below the chosen significance level (. 05). So, it looks for the values of W that cause t-crit value to equal zero for when determining the conditional effect of X, where the p-value is exactly the alpha, or .05 in most cases. At what values of W, do the results go from significant to non-significant, or vice-versa, in terms of conditional effect?\nYour results can either be of one, two, or zero values. If there is one value, that means there is only one value of W where the conditional effect either becomes significant or loses significance. If there are two values, that means there are two points at which W will change in significance. This will either mean the middle range is significant, but not the high and low values of W, or that the high and low values of W are significant, but not the middle range. The middle range is determined by the W values themselves. If there are no values, then the conditional effect is either always significant or never significant for all values of W. Next are graphical representations for what different types of Johnson-Newman results may look like. Where the line cross .05, that's where this approach looks for the value of W, giving us more insight into what extent our moderator... Well, moderates.<br>\n<img alt=\"5.

By finding the value in the table below, we can see that the conditional effect is significant before W = 3.3364, but non-significant after that point. So, it is significant with lower levels of puppy love. (First column, row 3.3364)<br>\n<img alt=\"5.

At its higher values, the moderator (puplove) does not have a significant effect on the relationship between time spent with Puppies (focal predictor) and Happiness (outcome variable) This implies that, increasing the time spent with Puppy does not affect/change (increases) happiness for individuals who already love Puppies.

You can now have lines that can help you to visualize the changes in X vs. Y, given the subgroups of W. Pretend that literature shows that the more someone loves puppies, the happier they are. We would like to test that theory, but with a moderator of time spent with puppies during a trial (dose).\nHere, we are recognizing that Dose is a multi-categorical variable for control group (0 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes with puppies).\nTypically, we would need to dummy-code these variables, but PROCESS does it for you, provided you remember one extra step.

Relatedly, homogeneity of covariance is equal variances and covariacnes across time. Sphericity is a tough assumption to meet, as we don't expect correlations between times 1, 3, and 5 to be necessarily the same. Mauchly's sphericity test in SPSS tests this assumption. We do NOT want this to be statistically significant. The distribution of the data will not be in line with an F-distribution\nLoss of statistical power\nPost-hoc tests become uninterpretable\nIf violated, what should we do?

Repeated Measures ANOVA Univariate DV\nMore rigid assumptions of sphericity\nWhen sphericity holds, use RM ANOVA\nYou can look at contrasts and other post-hoc tests MANOVA Multivariate DVs\nLess rigid assumptions of sphericity\nA large violation of sphericity (ε &lt; .70) and sample sizes of 10 people larger than the number of groups (j + 1), use MANOVA.

If the overall F for differences among treatments is statistically significant, further analysis is needed to evaluate where the significant differences are. The SPSS procedure contrasts that can be used to evaluate differences. If the repeated measure has k levels, a set of contrasts include (k - 1) comparisons\nOptions Polynomial contrasts (the default in SPSS, but rarely used in social sciences)\nRepeated contrasts\nSimple contrasts For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them. <br>Very similar to dummy coding in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" data-href=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Multiple Regression</a>, where we only know differences between the reference category and all other categories (not each other) Compare the mean of each level (except the last) with the mean of the subsequent level Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 2 &gt; Time 3 Useful if the responses are in a meaningful order (like time)\nEquivalence (or justifiable inequivalence) of measurement is crucial Makes more sense when the levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to different amounts of treatment (rather than different types)\nIf there are k levels for the repeated-measures factor, then (k - 1) polynomials will be tested.

SPSS makes it easy to restructure your data, albeit if certain parameters are in place first There must be an ID variable for every participant\nThere must be an index variable that indicates timepoint for data\nThere must NOT be duplication of a case within a timepoint\nPreferable if all cases have equal timepoints of data (makes things easier to see and is required by most analyses, though not necessarily for data restructure) Data &gt; Restructure &gt; Restructure Data Wizard!\nIgnore the words SPSS uses (they are hard to understand) and instead look at the pictures. Wide to stacked is first, and stacked to wide is second. Ignore the third one (trust me). “7. Repeated Measures Designs-3.png” could not be found. Select your ID variable and put it as the identifier variable and select your timepoint variable and put it as your index variable. Leave everything else as default on all other pages!\n“7.

So, if the global satisfaction scale has seven items that we want combined across time, we need to say seven variables. “7. Repeated Measures Designs-5.png” could not be found.\nSelect your ID variable and put it as the case group identification. You could also 'use case number' and have the ID variable be a fixed variable, but I find that more troublesome. You then have to include all items to be stacked in separate blocks based on what the variable will be. You must do this for every variable to be stacked. The dataset has 129 such variables, so you can see that this will take a long time. Most of the time, stacked data comes stacked so you don't need to do this. “7.

The test scores were compared over time. Thus, we have 3 levels in the within-subjects factor (Time). For each pair of levels, we can obtain a st of difference scores. The sphericity assumption states that these three sets of difference scores have equal variance. If the variance of the difference scores are statistically equal then the sphericity assumption has been met. The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA\nThe violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA. <br>The violation causes the 'Usual' F-test to become too liberal (i.e., an increase in the <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a> rate). Therefore, determining whether sphericity has been violated is very important. <br>Luckily, if violations of sphericity do occur, corrections have been developed to produce a more valid critical F-value (i.e., reduce the increase in <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a> rate) Like in Levene's HOV test, the null hypothesis is the variances of difference scores are equal.\nTest NOT Significant (p &gt; .05) &gt; Assumption MET!

General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)!

Testing for Extreme Outliers\nAn assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore <br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality.png\" target=\"_self\"> Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality-1.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.\n<br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality-2.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIn order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.\nIf you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIf the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.\nThe distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. Click Data -&gt; Split File\nClick Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. Proceed as above.

If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 - 2.5, the assumption is met. Examples <br><img alt=\"Testing the Independence of Error.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-the-independence-of-error.png\" target=\"_self\"> For this example, we'll say 1.482 is close enough to 1.5 and the assumption is met.

target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Moderation</a>\nMediation examines how the effect of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) is transmitted through a third variable, called the mediator (M). In simple mediation, there is one mediator. To determine if the IV influences the DV directly and/or indirectly via the mediator. The model splits the total effect into The portion of the effect of IV on DV that is not explained by the mediator. The portion of the effect that is transmitted from IV to DV through the mediator. Relationships among IV, mediator, and DV are linear. Scatterplots: Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot and plot DV vs. IV and DV vs. M. Look for a straight-line pattern. Residuals vs. Predicted Plot: Run Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear…; click Plots… to assign standardized predicted values (X-axis) and standardized residuals (Y-axis).\nCriteria: No systematic pattern (i.e., randomness, with any curve test yielding p &gt; .05). Residuals have constant variance across all levels of predictors. Examine the same residuals vs. predicted plot for an even spread (no funnel shape). Residuals are approximately normally distributed. Create histograms and Q–Q plots using Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram or Q–Q plot options. Criteria: Skewness values less than |2.0| and kurtosis values less than |7.0|; Q–Q plot points should lie near the diagonal line. Observations are independent. Confirm via your study design.\nReview the Durbin–Watson statistic from your regression output (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable). There are no unmeasured variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and DV. This is primarily a design issue; however, consider including control variables if needed. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX by Andrew Hayes\nChoose Model 4 (designed for simple mediation).\nSet the DV, IV, and mediator in the appropriate boxes.\nEnable bootstrapping (commonly set to 5,000 samples) to obtain robust confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effect.\nClick OK. Direct Path (IV → M): Example: a = 0.40, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path from Mediator to DV (M → DV, controlling for IV): Example: b = 0.50, SE = 0.12, p = .002 Indirect Effect (a × b): Example: 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.200.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.20 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.08, 0.35] (does not include zero → significant mediation). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for M):\nExample: c′ = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005\nTotal Effect (IV → DV without mediator):\nExample: c = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001 A mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to examine whether [Mediator] mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The total effect of [IV] on [DV] was significant (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001). When [Mediator] was entered into the model, the direct effect decreased (b = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005). The indirect effect was significant (b = 0.20, SE = 0.07, 95% CI [0.08, 0.35]), indicating that [Mediator] partially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator(s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV → Mediator 1 → DV IV → Mediator 2 → DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. each mediator.\nRun separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.\nUse Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.\nEnter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a1 = 0.30, b1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a2 = 0.25, b2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.” Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. predicted plots for each link: IV → M1, M1 → M2, and M2 → DV.\nUse histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M1 influences M2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M2 on M1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.\nChoose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).\nEnter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.\nClick Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV → Mediator 1: Example: a1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M1):\nExample: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002\nSequential Indirect Effect (IV → M1 → M2 → DV):\nCalculation: a1 × d × b2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):\nExample: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation. Check Assumptions in SPSS: Generate scatterplots, residual vs. predicted plots, histograms, and Q–Q plots.\nVerify diagnostic values: skewness (&lt; |2.0|), kurtosis (&lt; |7.0|), Durbin–Watson (1.5–2.5), and inter-mediator correlations (r &lt; 0.80 for parallel mediation).\nFor serial mediation, confirm intermediate regression steps are significant (p &lt; .05). Conduct Mediation Analysis with PROCESS: Use the appropriate model: Model 4 for simple and parallel mediation; Model 6 for serial mediation.\nEnter variables as specified and enable bootstrapping (commonly 5,000 samples) to generate 95% confidence intervals. Interpret Output: Evaluate p-values for each path (significant if p &lt; .05).\nFor indirect effects, confirm that bootstrapped confidence intervals do not include zero.

In this article, we detail the advantages of using these data sets to study developmental questions across the life span. First, we provide an overview of how using secondary data can increase studies’ scientiﬁc integrity. Then, we detail where and how data sets can be obtained that answer speciﬁc questions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues related to using longitudinal, population data sets. These data sets can enhance science and test theories by increasing the rigor and generalizability of research to the general population, making secondary data analysis an important method to consider.\nKeywords: Need to Read Primary data are collected by an individual or a team of researchers and are often based on the theory or models of the researcher or research team. These data are also generally proprietary and not shared with the larger research community. In contrast, secondary data analysis uses data collected by other researchers or organizations, and the users are generally not part of the design of the study. These data sets (e.g., most national studies) have been collected for the use of the research community or have been made available for other researchers to use (e.g., in data archives). These data sets were collected based on the research theories and models of the primary researchers and include extensive measurements on the areas of interest to the research team. Although some data sets remain proprietary to the original researcher or research team, new regulations on data sharing from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are increasing the amount of data available for secondary data analysis. Many secondary data sets contain similarities in measurement that allow many data sets to be combined using techniques such as integrative data analysis, a technique that is especially useful for data sets that represent highly selective groups (e.g., children of alcoholics) that would be difficult to find in a general population sample. Combining the data sets increases the sample size and thus the power to examine these groups. Using secondary data sets, especially those collected at the population level, increases statistical power and external validity as a result of a larger sample size and greater diversity of respondents (with regard to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). This advantage, combined with reducing the time and money it takes to collect one's own longitudinal data, makes secondary data analysis a good option.\nThese data resources are easy to obtain. In the US, the two largest social science data archives are the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Murray Research Archive.<br>\n<img alt=\"Social Science Secondary Data Archives Table.jpeg\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/social-science-secondary-data-archives-table.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nICPSR requires affiliation with a member institution. Some data sets are available for immediate download while others require an application explaining the scientific purpose for data use. Data are generally free though fees may apply for digitization of not-yet digital materials or other labor-intensive data-preparation tasks. Archives are easily searchable, including the ability to search by study topic or variable name. Searching by study topic is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching by variable name is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching for variable name is helpful when the researcher is interested in a particular variable, such as rates of endorsement or forms of measurement of a variable across studies. Most archives allow researchers to perform basic descriptive analyses online before downloading a data set, including frequency counts for each variable and tabular analysis. Scientists can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in responses, or not too much missing data for the new study. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. The most important step is to read all the data documentation - text documents posted in the data archive alongside the data. Understanding and properly accounting for the sampling frame and necessary weights are crucial in producing accurate results, and the study documentation contains the necessary information. Secondary data rarely have all the measures to answer investigators' questions. Using data that have been collected by others typically means that measures for some of the constructs germane to the research question will be missing. Because population data sets typically measure a broad set of constructs with limited measurement on any given construct, they often are not ideal for answering nuanced questions that require in-depth measurement. Once a researcher has addressed the issue of obtaining the data set or sets to address his or her research questions and whether they adequately answer the relevant research questions, additional statistical issues must be considered in analyzing this data. Because oversampling of one or more subpopulations is common in population-based studies, researchers often must apply a same weight if they want their findings to generalize to the target population. Subpopulations that are underrepresented in the sample relative to the target population have sample weights larger than 1.0, while the opposite holds for subpopulations overrepresented in the sample relative to the target population. When no sample weights are applied, it is as if a sample weight of 1.0 is uniformly applied to all subpopulations. In effect, this assumes all subpopulations are represented accurately within the sample, leading to biased estimates when this assumption does not hold. Typically, the appropriate set of sample weights and its corresponding variable name are identified clearly within a data set's documentation files. <br>In contrast to sample weights, which adjust for <a data-href=\"Sampling Bias\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/sampling-bias.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sampling Bias</a>, attrition weights correct for bias introduced by attrition. The objective of attrition weights is to render the Wave 2 sample comparable to the full Wave 1 sample. Mathematically, attrition weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition or dropping out: P (Wave 1) / (Wave 2) Combination weights (also called longitudinal weights) adjust for both sampling bias and attrition bias. Mathematically, combination weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., the sample weight) multiplied by the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition (i.e., the attrition weight): [P (target population) / P (sample)] x [P (Wave 1) / P (Wave 2)].\nWe suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights (either alone or as a part of combination weights) and instead of using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), or multiple imputation (MI) to adjust for attrition bias and then use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias. We make this recommendation because relative to FIML and MI, attrition weights (including combination weights) have two disadvantages: Unlike FIML and MI, attrition weights often sharply reduce the analytical sample size and, thereby, statistical power. Typically, only those participants with data at every wave are assigned an attrition weight and used in subsequent analyses. This problem is compounded as a study's number of waves (and therefore attrition) increases. Second, if many auxiliary variables (i.e., non-model variables related to missing data) are incorporated, FIML and MI may adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights. Most statistical packages can use FIML, including STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS, and AMOS, and many use MI (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS). Most large-scale data sets were collected using complex sample designs that entail a clustered sampling design (e.g., schools are randomly sampled and then all students within the selected schools are sampled). <br>Because a clustered sampling design reduces variance (e.g., 100 students from the same school are likely more similar to one another demographically than are 100 students from 100 different schools), it also reduces standard errors and thereby inflates the change for <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a>. To adjust for these design effects, a primary sampling unit variable (e.g., schools) and potentially a stratification variable are incorporated into analyses. Most statistical packages (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS) can adjust for a complex sampling design and typically the appropriate primary sampling unit and, if necessary, stratification variables are clearly identified within a data set's documentation files.

This point cannot be over-emphasized as many of the 'fatal' pitfalls of data analysis can be avoided by expending the mental energy to get your question right. There are six basic types of questions. Descriptive\nExploratory\nInferential\nPredictive\nCausal\nMechanistic Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. The type of question you are asking directly informs how you interpret your results. A descriptive question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. There is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the set of data that you are working with. An exploratory question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. These types of analyses are also called 'hypothesis-generating' analyses because rather than testing a hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question, you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. An inferential question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data. A predictive question would be one where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal. In other instances, even if your data are not from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer a causal question. A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a mechanistic question. By necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions. If a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering the inferential question. The type of question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis).\nIf this type of data set does not exist, then the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illness. Establish your expectations about the question\nGathering information about your question\nDetermining if your expectations match the information you gathered, and then refining your question (or expectations) if your expectations did not match the information you gathered. There are five key characteristics of a good question for a data analysis, which range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already been answered to the more abstract characteristic that each of the possible answers to the question should have a single interpretation and be meaningful. The question should be of interest to your audience, the identity of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with data.\nYou should also check that the question has not already been answered. With the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon to discover that your question of interest has been answered already.\nThe question should also stem from a plausible framework. If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end up with an answer that's difficult to interpret or have confidence in. Many questions are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible framework. The question, should also, of course, be answerable.\nSpecificity is also an important characteristic of a good question. Working towards specificity will refine your question and directly inform what steps to take when you start looking at data.\nWith this degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will either recommend or not recommend the specific action. Another aspect to consider when you’re developing your question is what will happen when you translate it into a data problem. Every question must be operationalized as a data analysis that leads to a result. Pausing to think through what the results of the data analysis would look like and how they might be interpreted is important as it can prevent you from wasting a lot of time embarking on an analysis whose result is not interpretable. The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question that uses inappropriate data. The problem with this question is that for a single possible answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations arises when at least one of the variables you use is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after. To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required to answer your question. A related problem that intergeres with interpretation of results is confounding. Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship between factors. A brief description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both your exposure of interest and your outcome of interest. As you refine your question, spend time identifying the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information about these potential confounders. Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a biased result. The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics above what exists in the general population. A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors, bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person might recall the past when responding to a survey. The best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the question with the data available to you.

It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Henry Taube (who won the Novel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I did not know was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right answer or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. We don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid - that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity.' that kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, ‘I don’t know’. The point of the exam isn’t to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it’s the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student’s weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student’s knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.

A research question is a statement that identifies the phenomenon to be studied. For example, \"Does preschool influence children's language skills?\" Why are good research questions important and what makes them 'good?' Purpose\nRelevance\nFeasibility To produce a research question, you need to know the literature first. Find out what has been done and how you can contribute to the existing literature. I have a research question. If you do not have a research question, narrow down your topic. Review the literature\nIs the question viable, original. feasible?\nYou have a research question! Narrow down on an area of interest\nWithin that area, try to answer a question that: Has either not been addressed before\nHas been addressed before but that you could extend (i.e., new data-set, different approach, etc.)\nHas been addressed but requires replication\nStarts a new research area (NOT recommended) Read as much as you can on the topic\nRead recent studies first, then read backwards\nRead all relevant papers (or at least the influential ones)\nIdeas on the research topic often come from reading\nThe more you read, the easier it will be to come up with research questions Reviewing the literature will allow you to understand whether your question has been answered/is valid.\nBy reading previous studies, you might get ideas on how to tweak your original research question into a new one. Whether you have or do not have a research question, it is crucial that you review the literature in the area first. Many leave the review as the last step, but this is dangerous. Not original\nNot feasible Time constraint (e.g., not enough time)\nResources (e.g., lack of data)\nKnowledge (e.g., do I know method X?) Too broadly defined research question\nNot well justified\nNot motivated by literature Start searching for a topic as early as possible\nOnce you narrow down a topic/area, look at the relevant literature (i.e., a literature review)\nOnce you have done the literature review (has it already been done? No, why not? Is it interesting/relevant?), then ask yourself: Is the question specific (not too broad)?\nIs it feasible in the allotted time?\nDo I have enough resources (data) to answer this question?\nHow about knowledge (methods)?\nIs the research question falling within my area of research?\nIf the answer is yes to all the previous question, congratulations, you have a research question. Your time is your most important resource. Do not take a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances) Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic/data set\nMore efficient time use (e.g., read similar lit)\nLooks good when others are evaluating your CV A good research question will Allow outsiders to see your intentions\nHelp you develop hypotheses (not always)\nContributes to existing knowledge Contribution does not have to be huge\nReplication is a contribution\nFilling a gap is not enough justification, why does this gap matter? Guide the design of your methods\nAllow the target population to be identified\nIdentify the outcome variables and key predictors of those variables\nDetermine what type of study is needed (e.g., descriptive, correlational, experimental)\nIdentify background characteristics that might influence predictors and outcomes\nRaise questions about how to best collect data\nInfluence the number of participants in the study Writing a good question is an iterative process What do you want to learn about?\nDraft and redraft with increasing specificity using the guidelines listed above. Ask for feedback from colleagues (science is a collective effort).\nBuild on the work of others by conducting a systematic literature review. This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. Hook the reader in. Practice! Explain the larger context that this study will inform. Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. Flows directly from the earlier points in paragraph 1. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. State the basic aims, hypotheses, questions, and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths) Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph - could be theoretically, in terms of policy, filling holes, etc. Can be combined with paragraph 2 in some cases. \"The scientific literature is our institutional memory.

The main question of interest was the extent to which personality traits at the time of marriage predict marital satisfaction and marital commitment post marriage. The researcher wrote two papers. One focused on the prediction of marital satisfaction, and the other focused on the prediction of marital commitment. The design of the study was he same in each paper, with the exception of the change in outcomes. Piecemeal A researcher recruited newlyweds and planned annual assessments over a five years. Some measures were assessments over a five years. Some measures were common to each annual assessment, whereas others common to each annual assessment, whereas others were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote an article regarding the relation between divorce history an article regarding the relation between divorce history and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital satisfaction from those who did not experience the satisfaction from those who did not experience the transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The researcher decided to publish these as three separate researcher decided to publish these as three separate articles. Not Piecemeal Researcher B was interested in the relation between family process and adolescent adjustment. She conducted and published a study in which the main conducted and published a study in which the main objective was to identify specific family processes that objective was to identify specific family processes that mediated the relation between family structure and mediated the relation between family structure and adjustment. Later, she read a new study that proposed that two of the family processes that she studied had an interactive effect on adjustment. Although such an interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, in additional analyses she found that such an effect did occur in her sample, although in a slightly different than in the newly published article. She wrote a second article to address this issue. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the extent to which support for marriage from family and friends affects rating of relationship quality. He collected data from a large convenience sample. Although not planned, the sample contained about 60% of persons in their first marriages and 40% of persons in remarriages. The researcher prepared two papers that examined the question of interest. In the first paper, he used data from the first-marriage subjects, whereas in the second paper he used data from the remarried subjects. The variables assessed and reported in the two papers were the same. Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the links between family structure and child adjustment. The researcher administered a survey to high school students. She discovered that there were large numbers in two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families, but very few students were in the single divorced father and stepmother families as part of the survey, students in stepfamilies answered survey items regarding the parenting behaviors of their stepparents as well as of their parents. She wrote two papers. The first examined differences in adjustment in children from two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families (the groups with the largest sample sizes). To facilitate the interpretation of family structure effects, she decided to exclude the rather small number of students in the second paper, she explored whether children's adjustment was related to how they rated the parenting behaviors of their parents and stepparents. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in rates of divorce in first-marriages and remarriages in different countries. She obtained data from an international organization that contained information on a number of different countries and wrote two papers. The first addressed the divorce rates in these two kinds of couples in Canada, and the second dealt with the same issue in England. The same theoretical rationale and measures were used in both papers, although the results led to different conclusions. Piecemeal Focus on quality and not quantity of publications Replicate the study with a different sample, setting, or methodology. Do this if most of the past research you have read examines one type of sample, setting, or method. Examine the topic using a different design. If the study was a quasi- or non-experimental, conduct an experiment. Do this if causation has not been consistently established by past research, or it has not been consistently established with the population you are interested in. Examine how another variable might impact results Do this if you have research evidence to suggest that results may depend on another variable. Conduct a similar study with a different outcome or dependent variable. Do this if you find research evidence supporting the new associations you plan to examine. Being first is not always a sign of being a good scientist Many discoveries are wrong or over claimed. You do not show you are a great scientist by being the first to claim something. A large part of getting over being scooped is getting over yourself and realizing that science is bigger than any one of us. It also means you are doing something other people care about. If you are scooped, do not be discouraged. It is unlikely that any two researchers would address a question in the exact same way.

For most, the public-use files provide all the data they will need for most analyses, though some users may find that only the restricted files have the specific data they need. If you are not sure, first examine the public-use data. Outliers (unusually high or unusually low values) are top- or bottom-coded to prevent identification of unique schools, teachers, parents, and children without affecting overall data quality. <br>Some <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Continuous Variable\" data-href=\"Continuous Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">continuous</a> variables are converted into categorical variables, and some categorical variables have their categories collapsed. <br>Category value labels are provided for <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Continuous Variable\" data-href=\"Continuous Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">continuous</a> variables that are converted into categorical variables. Variables with too few cases and/or a sparse distribution are suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2 and labelled 'suppressed' in the Electronic Codebook (ECB). The value -2 means that the data for this variable are suppressed to protect the respondent's confidentiality. Variables that provide a particularly identifying characteristic, such as a specific disability, or information that could be matched against external data sources to obtain a specific identifying characteristic, such as exact date of marriage or divorce, are also suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2. Will vary for different data, but for all, you will need to complete an application. Submit signed license document Primary researcher\nSenior official at institution Submit signed and notarized affidavits of nondisclosure for all proposed users. Submit a signed security plan (must specify the exact locked location) where the data will be secured. You cannot transmit restricted-use data.\nMaintain a data license file and ensure that all authorized users follow the agreed upon terms. Participate in unannounced security inspections to ensure compliance. Adhere to established publication rules. Submit all materials for disclosure review. Complete annual trainings online. Complete yearly reports of what work you have done. Start with a broad question. Think about who might collect that data (e.g., governments, other researchers, etc.) Want to stick close to a specific subfield or type of data? Look for recognized repositories in your field, large research projects, or publications that have data access statements. Likely need to combine several search strategies.

Searching by variable name is helpful when you are interested in a particular variable (e.g., spanking). Often, studies are organized into collections in each archive so a researcher can quickly identify groups of studies focused on a particular subarea. The organization of each archive varies, but most share several major features. Most archives allow you to perform basic descriptive analyses before the downloading a dataset. This is great because you can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in repsonses, for your purposes. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. Most archives offer FAQs, tips for effective searching, and access to staff members via email. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/\" target=\"_self\">ICPSR tutorial</a> How to search for variables and filter\nHow to search for publications\nHow to look at descriptive within and across studies\nHow to look for studies and variables within studies\nStudy usage reports Subject Matter Consider whether the subject is consistent with your problem definition and whether the data apply to the time/population of interest Methods Consider whether the data can be used with your preferred method of analysis or if you'll need ot learn a new skill. Measurement Determine whether the data capture the measures and constructs you are interested in with sufficient/adequate detail. Time You will save time on data collection and get access to larger scale data, but may spend more time on cleaning, modifying, getting documentation, etc. License/Copyright Is the data licensed? Does it restrict usage? Terms of Use Are the terms you need to meet to gain access to the data or other restrictions? Citations You will want to formally cite the data you use; data sets should have a persistent identifier to help cite the data, such as DOI. Documentation Look for good documentation on how the data was collected, for what purpose, how it was transformed. Credibility Is the data from a recognized lab, researcher, institution? Do the publications based on the data hold? Does the dataset contain the information you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?\nDo the measures used match those you require?\nIs the data set a proxy for the data you really need?\nDoes the dataset cover the population that is the subject of your research?\nDoes the dataset cover the geographical area that is the subject of your research?\nCan data about the population that is the subject of your research be separated from unwanted data?\nAre the data for the right time period or sufficiently up to date?\nAre data available for all the variables you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?\nAre the variables defined clearly? How reliable is the dataset?\nHow credible is the data source?\nIs it clear what the source of the data is?\nDo the credentials of the source of the data (author, institution, or organization sponsoring the data) suggest it is likely to be reliable?\nDo the data have an associated copyright statement?\nDo associated published documents exist?\nDoes the source contain contact details for obtaining further information about the data?\nIs the method described clearly?\nIf sampling was used, what was the procedure and what were the associated sampling errors and response rates?\nWho was responsible for collecting or recording the data?\n(For surveys) Is a copy of the questionnaire or interview checklist included?\n(For compiled data) Are you clear how the data were analyzed and compiled?\nAre the data likely to contain measurement bias?\nWhat was the original purpose for which the data were collected?\nWho was the target The most important step is to read ALL the data documentation.

Sampling & Complex Designs","icon":"","description":"\nWhy should we strive for population representative sampling? Important for policy or practice. We do not want to recommend changes that are not based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact. How? Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)\nWork on large teams\nUse secondary data Normally used to compensate for over- and under-sampling of individuals\nExample It is common to over-sample minority groups... If we doubled the size of our minority sample, then each minority case would get a design weight of 1/2 or .5. We use the design weight when we want the statistics to be representative of the population. Used to compensate for the fact that persons with certain characteristics are not as likely to respond to the survey. Example Most population surveys have substantially more female than male respondents; because surveys over-represents females and under-represents males in the population, a weight is used to compensate for this bias. There are many responsent characteristics that are likely to be related to the propensity to respond such as age, education, race/ethnicity, place of residence. Dataset with cases Simple mean (4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 2.8 Weighted mean {(4 1) + (2 2) + (1 4) + (5 1) + (2 * 2)} / 10 = 2.1 With unweighted data, each case is counted equally\nWith weighted data, each case is counted relative to its representation in the population\nUnweighted data represent only those in the sample who provide data\nWeights allow analyses that represent the target population\n<img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs.png\" target=\"_self\"> Most STATA commands can deal with weighted data, where the weight is a variable in the dataset. You need to specify the type of weight and the weight variable, using brackets at the end of your command, as in:\nsummarize x [weight=weightvarname]\ntab x [weight=weightvarname]\nregress y x [weight=weightvarname]\nThere are 4 types of weights in STATA, but for most data analyses you will use one of the following: Probability pweights, for observations sampled with unequal probability of selection. Use this for inferential analyses.\nAnalytic aweights, for data containing averages where the average is weighted by the # obs used in calculating the average…. Use this for your descriptive statistics. <br><img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-1.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-1.png\" target=\"_self\">\nDifferent studies create different types of weights... Some data create weights depending on: Level of analysis (child, teacher, or school)\nType of analysis (cross-sectional vs. Longitudinal)\nSource of data (child assessment, parent interview, teacher questionnaires, etc.)\nFor example, the ECLS-K has ~ 105 different options Many suggest you use combination weights when estimating longitudinal analyses because they assume that these users will not adjust for attrition on their own. I suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights. Instead, use modern missing data procedures for attrition bias, and use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias I make this recommendation because attrition weights have two key disadvantages Attrition weights often reduce the analytical sample size, and thereby, statistical power. If many non-model variables related to missing data are incorporated, missing data techniques adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights Use weights whenever possible, but some methods do not allow weights\nSteps to follow to avoid vias in unweighted analyses <br>Include as <a data-href=\"Independent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independent Variable</a> that might account for the sample design or non-response\n<br>If a weight is available, it can also be included as an <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Independent Variable\" data-href=\"Independent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">IV</a>\nIf the weight is associated with the outcom ein a model including the design variables, then the weight is likely to have been constructed in a way related to your outcome; bias is possile. E.g., some multilevel models, some structural equation programs, etc. National samples are first divided into primary sampling units... What these units are depends on the study.\n- E.g., in many data of the US the PSUs are geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties<br>\n<img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-2.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-2.png\" target=\"_self\"> After identifying PSUs, then PSUs are stratified into groups. These groups are formed to keep similar units together... How many and what types of strata are determined by study goals.<br>\n<img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-3.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-3.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThen within each strata, and within PSUs, you sample Software can make the adjustment... A few different approaches with the easiest being the Taylor Series approach Use primary sampling unit (PSU) and strata variables in the data file. The strata and PSU identifiers are often associated with a specific sampling weight variable. For example, in the ECLS-K the weight C1CW0 has the following strata and PSU: C1TVWSTR and C1TCWPSU svyset PSU [pweight = WEIGHT], strata(STRATA)\nThen use svy: before your subsequent commands (e.g., svy: tab or svy: mean or svy: regress)\nsvy: will NOT work with all commands\nsvy: mean and mean [weight = weight] yield the same mean estimates… it is the SEs that are different)<br>\n<img alt=\"7.

The first is the data file you have been working on for class activities the last several week. The second is located in this week's folder. A researcher wants to know whether maternal depressive symptoms are associated with children’s early learning and development. But before the researcher can address this question, you are asked to think about and address missing data. The researcher has provided you with several variables in addition to the variables you have worked with thus far:\nYou are asked to include an overall composite of depressive symptoms. The research provides you with 12 items that you are asked to composite (P2BOTHER P2APPETI P2BLUE P2KPMIND P2DEPRES P2EFFORT P2FEARFL P2RESTLS P2TALKLS P2LONELY P2SAD P2NOTGO).\nYou will also include three child variables: a) a variable capturing children’s academic achievement, b) a variable capturing children’s socioemotional skills, and c) a variable capturing children’s executive functioning. For the academic achievement measure, you will need to create a new composite variable that is composed of reading, math, and science (X2RSCALK4 X2MSCALK4 X2SSCALK4). For socioemotional skills, you will need to create a new variable that is the average of teacher reports of self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior (i.e.,&nbsp;X2TCHINT X2TCHEXT X2TCHCON X2TCHPER). Children’s executive functioning skills are captured with a single item:&nbsp;X2DCCSTOT.\nThe researcher also wants you to include covariates/indicators for race/ethnicity (X_RACETH_R), child sex (X_CHSEX_R), income (X2INCCAT_I), parents’ marital status (P1CURMAR), parents physical health (P2HEALTH), household members under 18 (X1LESS18), and household members over 18 (X1OVER18) .\nWith that in mind...Step 1: You need to merge the new data into the dataset you have been working with. This requires a 1 to 1 merge using CHILDID. This step will be graded via your do/log files (.25 points)Step 2: Once the data are merged, examine your data. Orient yourself to the old and new variables (e.g., are they continuous, categorical etc etc) and&nbsp;recode&nbsp;any new variables as appropriate. Recall how Stata recognizes missing data. Please also&nbsp;create&nbsp;the appropriate composites&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to imputation. The composites will be what you will use in your imputation.&nbsp;If you recode other variables, please provide a justification. This step will be graded via your do/log files and your justification in your word document. (.25 points) Step 3: Once you have cleaned your data,&nbsp;run&nbsp;some descriptives for all of your variables (including your covariates) and determine the degree of missing values for each variable. Please also estimate a correlation matrix for your focal independent and dependent variables (do&nbsp;not&nbsp;include the list of covariates for your correlation matrix). What &nbsp;patterns you notice from the descriptive statistics? How much missing data are there for the variables? What patterns do you notice from the correlation matrix? (1.00 point) Step 4:&nbsp;Determine&nbsp;whether data are MCAR. Examine and discuss the missing data patterns. Are there common patterns of missing data? Are there uncommon patterns of missing data? Anything you notice worth discussing? If data are not MCAR, discuss whether the data may meet assumptions of MAR or MNAR. Why or why not? If you have any concerns proceeding to imputation, discuss it here. (1.25 points) Step 5:&nbsp;Run&nbsp;an imputation model with 10 datasets. Make sure you specify each variable correctly. And remember to&nbsp;upload&nbsp;your do and log files (for the entire assignment). This step will be graded via your do file (1.00 point) Step 6: After you have run your imputation,&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;descriptives&nbsp;within&nbsp;the 10 imputed datasets. You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to do this for every variable. Run these descriptives for the focal variables of interest (depressive symptoms, children's academic achievement, social skills, and executive functioning). Use the mi xeq command (e.g., mi xeq: sum XYZ). Discuss what you notice about the means/SDs across the imputations. (1.00 point)Step 7.&nbsp;Estimate&nbsp;correlations (use mi xeq: corr) among your focal variables from step 1, but this time&nbsp;within&nbsp;your 10 datasets. Are there any similarities between the imputed and non-imputed data? Are there any other differences you notice? (.75 points) Step 8. Upload your word document, log file, and do file. Please upload stata versions of your log/do files (not copied/pasted into word).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741193467825,"modifiedTime":1741193511396,"sourceSize":4923,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Assignment 4.md","exportPath":"university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/contextual-outlier.html":{"title":"Contextual Outlier","icon":"","description":"\nDeviates significantly with respect to a specific context of the object\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/contextual-outlier.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740958240831,"modifiedTime":1740958244013,"sourceSize":73,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Contextual Outlier.md","exportPath":"university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/contextual-outlier.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/global-outliers.html":{"title":"Global Outliers","icon":"","description":"\nDeviates significantly from the rest of the dataset\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/global-outliers.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740958252589,"modifiedTime":1740958255566,"sourceSize":53,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Global Outliers.md","exportPath":"university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/global-outliers.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/stata-command-guide.html":{"title":"STATA Command Guide","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"5.
