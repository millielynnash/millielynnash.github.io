Consequences, and Legacy","icon":"","description":"The Chernobyl disaster occurred on April 26, 1986, during a late-night safety test on Reactor No.4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine. The accident was precipitated by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK-1000 reactor and operator errors. In particular, the RBMK reactor had an unstable design (a positive void coefficient), meaning a loss of coolant could accelerate the nuclear reaction, and its control rods had graphite tips that initially increased reactivity when inserted (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output could increase if cooling,other safety mechanisms have been\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output%20could%20increase%20if%20cooling,other%20safety%20mechanisms%20have%20been\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). During the test, operators disabled critical safety systems and drove the reactor to a low-power, unstable state. A sudden power surge ensued when they attempted an emergency shutdown, leading to massive energy buildup.<br>Moments later, a steam explosion blew apart the reactor core, followed by a second explosion (likely hydrogen or another steam blast) that demolished the reactor building and exposed the core to the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The blasts ignited fires, including a graphite fire in the reactor core, that burned for ten days. The underlying causes trace to poor safety culture and secrecy in the USSR at the time. An investigation later concluded that the accident was “the result of a flawed reactor design… operated with inadequately trained personnel,” exacerbated by Cold War isolation and lack of safety culture (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The April 1986 disaster at,lack of any safety culture\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20April%201986%20disaster%20at,lack%20of%20any%20safety%20culture\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In short, inherent reactor vulnerabilities and human mistakes combined to trigger the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.<br>The immediate human toll of Chernobyl was severe. Two plant workers were killed on the night of the explosion – one instantly, and another shortly after from injuries (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the days that followed, dozens of firefighters and first responders who heroically fought the fires received extremely high radiation doses. <a data-href=\"Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)</a> devastated many of them: 28 emergency workers died from ARS within a few weeks (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

Dozens more suffered serious radiation injuries.<br>Soviet authorities evacuated the surrounding population as the scale of the disaster became evident. The nearby company town of Pripyat (population ~49,000) was not informed of the danger on the first day. Only 36 hours after the accident, on April 27, buses finally moved all Pripyat residents out, turning it into a ghost city (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion zone was established 36,8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion%20zone%20was%20established%2036,8\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Over the next two weeks, the evacuation zone was expanded to a 30 km radius, ultimately relocating about 116,000 people by mid-May 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the years following, evacuations and resettlement continued as more contaminated villages were emptied – eventually some 350,000 people in total were relocated due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,result of the accident%2C but\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,result%20of%20the%20accident%2C%20but\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Evacuees left behind homes and belongings forever; many received only moderate radiation doses (most under 50 mSv, though some got higher) during the short delay (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=match at L324 evacuated received,received 100 mSv or more\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=match%20at%20L324%20evacuated%20received,received%20100%20mSv%20or%20more\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The sudden displacement and fear caused significant trauma among the population.Offsite, there were no immediate deaths, but radiation sickness symptoms did appear in some of the local populace soon after (e.g. headaches, metallic taste). Tens of millions across Europe were exposed to low levels of fallout (see environmental impact below), and children in affected areas were given iodine tablets in some regions to block radioactive iodine uptake. The psychological shock and confusion were immense – for Soviet citizens who were kept largely in the dark initially, and for neighboring countries alarmed by the drifting radiation.<br>The Chernobyl accident caused an unprecedented release of radioactive material into the environment. The initial explosion and subsequent fire ejected at least 5% of the reactor’s radioactive core into the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). A towering plume of radioactive gases and particles drifted with the winds for over a week. The most intense fallout blanketed areas close to the plant. A 4-6 km² pine forest immediately downwind was saturated with radiation; the trees literally died and turned rust-red within days, earning it the name the “Red Forest.” This 600-hectare patch of woodland absorbed lethal doses (up to ~100 Gray), killing the pines and many small animals in the area (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>).

In the worst-hit zones, animals also succumbed – for example, horses on an island 6 km away died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by extreme radioiodine exposure (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Livestock had to be slaughtered and crops were ruined across large swathes of land. Water and soil near the site were severely contaminated; radiological “hot spots” (with dangerous levels of cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, etc.) dotted the map in northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.<br>The radioactive plume did not stop at the Soviet borders. Within two days, winds carried radionuclides into Eastern and Northern Europe. On April 28, sensors at the Forsmark nuclear plant in Sweden (over 1,000 km away) detected radiation, forcing an investigation that revealed the source was Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant%2C,rising radiation levels%2C but a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the%20Forsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%2C,rising%20radiation%20levels%2C%20but%20a\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). As the cloud spread, rain-outs deposited contamination in patches across Europe. Notably, parts of Belarus (to the north) received heavy fallout, as did areas of Scandinavia, Poland, Austria, and the UK. In the United Kingdom, for example, radioactive cesium from Chernobyl fell on upland pastures; in the immediate aftermath, the government restricted the movement of some 4.2 million sheep across 9,700 farms to prevent tainted meat entering the food supply (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).

Across Europe, a wide range of foods (milk, leafy vegetables, wild game, mushrooms, etc.) had to be tested or discarded in 1986 due to fallout contamination.<br>In the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, the environment was badly scarred. The reactor fire belched radioactive iodine-131, cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium and other isotopes into the air (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). Iodine-131 (with an 8-day half-life) delivered high doses to the thyroids of grazing animals and children who drank local milk in the first weeks, causing later thyroid disorders. Heavier elements fell close to the plant, creating an extremely hazardous zone within ~10 km. The Pripyat River and Dnieper water basin were threatened by runoff; emergency crews dug up topsoil and built dams to prevent contaminants from spreading through waterways. Despite these efforts, ecological damage was acute: plants died, and some animal populations in high-dose areas crashed or stopped reproducing (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The immediate environmental legacy of Chernobyl was a poisoned landscape – an estimated 77 kilograms of radioactive material were lofted into the atmosphere, traveling as far as 2,000 km away (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>), and leaving a footprint of contamination that would last for generations.<br>The Chernobyl disaster had significant immediate political repercussions, both domestically within the Soviet Union and internationally. In the USSR, the accident exposed the deep flaws in the Soviet government’s crisis management and secrecy. Initially, authorities were slow to admit the severity of the situation. Local evacuations were delayed and the broader public was not informed promptly. Only on April 28 – two days after the explosion, once Swedish monitors raised global alarm – did the Soviet government make a brief 20-second announcement on state TV acknowledging an accident at Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An investigative commission has been\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An%20investigative%20commission%20has%20been\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). This minimalist statement offered few details, reflecting the regime’s instinct to cover up bad news. Such lack of transparency put citizens at risk and angered neighboring countries. Gorbachev himself did not publicly address Chernobyl until May 14, 1986, more than three weeks later. The delay and initial secrecy eroded public trust. Soviet citizens in Ukraine and Belarus, seeing helicopters overhead and troops moving without clear explanation, felt a sense of betrayal that they were not immediately warned of the invisible danger.<br>Internationally, Chernobyl proved to be a public relations disaster for the Soviet Union. The USSR was criticized for its failure to promptly alert the world and for rejecting outside help initially. The incident strained relations with Western Europe – for example, Sweden, Finland, and others demanded explanations as radioactive clouds crossed their territories. The political fallout added pressure on Soviet leadership to be more open and cooperative. The disaster became a catalyst for Glasnost (openness): it demonstrated the deadly cost of government secrecy. Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that “the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl… even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union” five years later (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls The nuclear meltdown at,The commission was to\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls%20The%20nuclear%20meltdown%20at,The%20commission%20was%20to\" target=\"_self\">VIEW: Turning point at Chernobyl — Mikhail S Gorbachev</a>). While historians debate the extent of Chernobyl’s role in the USSR’s dissolution, it undeniably undermined the credibility of Soviet authorities. The tragedy spurred newfound environmental activism and public questioning of nuclear safety in the Eastern Bloc. In summary, the immediate political consequence was a profound shock that forced the Soviet government to confront its own shortcomings, setting in motion changes that transcended the issue of nuclear power.<br>In the decades since 1986, extensive studies have been conducted on Chernobyl’s health impact. The most clear-cut long-term health effect has been a sharp increase in thyroid cancer cases among those who were children or adolescents in affected areas at the time of the accident. Radioactive iodine-131 released from the reactor accumulated in pastures and was ingested via milk; this led to an epidemic of thyroid disorders. By 2005, over 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported in exposed children/teens (notably in Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Fortunately, thyroid cancer is largely treatable – the vast majority of patients survived. As of 2011, 15 deaths had been attributed to these Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Aggressive screening and treatment campaigns in the 1990s saved many lives. Aside from thyroid issues, major epidemiological surveys have not conclusively linked the Chernobyl accident to a generalized increase in other cancers or health effects in the broader population (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), “apart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident.” (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In particular, studies have not found a definitive rise in leukemia, solid tumors, or birth defects that can be attributed to Chernobyl radiation exposure in the general population (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>However, it is important to note that estimating long-term deaths is complex and subject to debate. Low-dose radiation effects are hard to tease out from normal cancer rates. Some scientific models project that over the lifetime of those exposed, Chernobyl’s fallout could cause a few thousand excess cancer deaths (for example, one projection suggested about 4,000 future cancer deaths among the higher-exposed groups in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are expected from other causes\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are%20expected%20from%20other%20causes\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Other analyses, often using the linear no-threshold model, predict higher numbers – for instance, a 2006 report (TORCH) estimated 30,000 to 60,000 worldwide cancer deaths in the long run due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).

These larger estimates are controversial and not universally accepted; they rely on statistical assumptions and include very low-dose regions where any effect would be too small to measure. The consensus of bodies like the WHO and UNSCEAR is that outside of thyroid cancers, Chernobyl’s long-term health impacts (while tragic on an individual level) have been limited in scope relative to initial fears (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Nonetheless, each of those statistics reflects personal tragedies and serious illnesses that have affected thousands of families.<br>Beyond physical health, the psychological and social effects have been profound. The disaster uprooted entire communities and created an enduring sense of fear. Studies have found elevated rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse among Chernobyl evacuees and residents of contaminated areas ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015%29\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). The term “radiophobia” has been used to describe the chronic fear of radiation exposure that many people carry, sometimes causing more harm (in stress and mental health) than the radiation itself. Being labeled a “Chernobyl victim” or “survivor” led to social stigma and hopelessness in some cases (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Populations in affected areas often reported worse self-assessed health than objective medical exams would indicate, due to perceived danger (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Thus, a major long-term impact of Chernobyl has been on mental health and community cohesion. The disaster also had inter-generational aspects: while studies (including a 2021 whole-genome study) have not found evidence of significant genetic mutations passed to children of survivors or liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1929 Chernobyl liquidators,generational genetic effects.[ 223\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1929%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,generational%20genetic%20effects.%5B%20223\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>), young people from the region have grown up under the shadow of Chernobyl’s legacy, which influences their social and economic opportunities.<br>In summary, nearly 39 years on, Chernobyl’s health legacy is a mixed picture. There have been thousands of thyroid cancers (largely survivable), and possibly some increase in other cancers and health issues among the most exposed, but no mass epidemic of radiation-induced disease outside those categories that can be unambiguously demonstrated (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The trauma and displacement caused by the disaster, however, left lasting scars on public health in the form of psychological distress and disrupted lives.Paradoxically, the long-term ecological effects of Chernobyl include both persistent environmental contamination and the revival of wildlife in the abandoned zone. In the immediate aftermath, Chernobyl created one of the most radioactive environments on the planet, devastating local ecosystems. Yet over time, as humans withdrew from the area, nature has shown a remarkable capacity to rebound in many respects.<br>On the negative side, the environment remains contaminated with long-lived radionuclides that will persist for decades or more. Isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life ~30 years) and strontium-90 (half-life ~29 years) still taint the soil and vegetation in the Exclusion Zone and beyond. In the worst hot spots (e.g. the Red Forest and near the reactor), soil and plant life are loaded with radionuclide levels that inhibit normal biological processes. Studies have found increased mutation rates in many organisms: one analysis showed plant and animal mutation rates in the Chernobyl region were up to 20 times higher than normal background levels (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). There is evidence of elevated mortality and reduced reproductive success in some species living in the most contaminated areas, consistent with radiation-induced genetic damage (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). For example, some birds in high-radiation zones have been observed to have smaller brain sizes or cataracts, and fewer insects (like bees, butterflies, spiders) are found in these areas in some studies. Trees in certain plots grow more slowly due to radionuclide uptake. Forest ecosystems have been altered: the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) in soil were initially impaired by radiation, leading to a thick layer of semi-decomposed leaf litter that persisted for years. Even today, wild boar in parts of Germany and Austria still show high cesium levels from eating Chernobyl-tainted mushrooms and soils (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported,lamb industry in Norway were\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Agricultural%20Authority%20reported,lamb%20industry%20in%20Norway%20were\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). And periodic wildfires in the Exclusion Zone can remobilize radionuclides, as burning plants release cesium and strontium back into the air – a concern that persists each fire season. Thus, ecologically, Chernobyl created a chronic environmental hazard in the contaminated regions: a “dirty” ecosystem where radioactive elements circulate and will slowly decay over generations.<br>On the other hand, the absence of human activity in the vast Exclusion Zone has allowed wildlife to flourish in unexpected ways. With 2,600 km² of land (in Ukraine) largely free from people, the area has become an unintended wildlife sanctuary. By the 2010s, biologists conducting long-term censuses observed that many large animal populations were thriving. A 2015 scientific study using animal track counts and camera traps found no evidence of reduced mammal abundance in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone compared to similar uncontaminated nature reserves – in fact, populations of elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves were as high or higher than in less disturbed reserves (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The study concluded that chronic radiation had not significantly affected these wildlife populations; instead, the removal of humans (and associated activities like farming, hunting, logging) allowed nature to rebound vigorously (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Subsequent research and observations have noted an increase in biodiversity: the Exclusion Zone now hosts species rarely seen in the region for decades prior. Wolves roam in large numbers (some estimates suggest the zone has one of the highest densities of wolves in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Lynx and Eurasian brown bears – species that were once extirpated locally – have been spotted within the zone. Endangered European bison have been reintroduced and are breeding. The Przewalski’s horse, a rare wild equine, was released into the zone in the 1990s and now herds of these horses graze the grasslands of Chernobyl. Moose, foxes, badgers, wild boar, deer, and dozens of bird species inhabit the forests and marshes. Even the Pripyat town itself and derelict buildings are used by wildlife (e.g. nesting birds, small mammals). In essence, in the long term, Chernobyl’s ecosystem has transformed into a unique experiment: a landscape of high radiation pockets but flourishing wildlife, illustrating the resilience of nature when freed from human pressures (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some scientists have termed it a “accidental wildlife reserve.” Photographic evidence and surveys by organizations like the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve (established by Ukraine in 2016) document robust ecosystems, though still affected by the residue of contamination.<br>It’s important to balance this picture: radiation is certainly not “good” for wildlife, and in highly contaminated spots the damage to organisms is real (for instance, smaller creatures with short lifespans show higher mutation impacts). Scientists continue to debate the extent of sublethal effects on Chernobyl’s wildlife – some studies find more genetic abnormalities or shorter lifespans in animals from radioactive hot spots, while others point to the abundant population numbers as a sign of adaptation or tolerance (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). The likely reality is that many species have been able to recover because the benefit of habitat free from humans outweighs the detriments of the radiation levels they experience (which for most of the zone are low to moderate now). The Chernobyl zone has thus become a living laboratory for studying chronic low-dose radiation on ecosystems, with ongoing research that will inform ecology and radiobiology for decades. From an ecological perspective, Chernobyl’s legacy is a landscape of contrasts: lingering contamination and altered biological processes, alongside a teeming revival of wildlife in what has become one of Europe’s largest rewilded areas.<br>The Chernobyl disaster’s ramifications extended into the geopolitical and policy realm, influencing nuclear energy policies and international cooperation. In the Soviet Union, as mentioned, Chernobyl was a catalyst for Glasnost and political reform. It forced Soviet leadership to cooperate more with international authorities – for example, in August 1986 (just months after the accident), the USSR sent a delegation to the IAEA in Vienna to openly present details of the accident to the world, a notable break from past secrecy ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were subsequently restarted but all,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were%20subsequently%20restarted%20but%20all,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Gorbachev’s policies of openness were reinforced by the recognition that hiding disasters was untenable. In the bigger picture, Chernobyl “led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union.” (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The Chernobyl disaster was a,his program of liberal reform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20Chernobyl%20disaster%20was%20a,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some commentators even argue that the disaster contributed to the fall of the USSR by exposing its systemic problems and costing enormous resources – as noted earlier, Gorbachev later said Chernobyl was a more important factor in the Soviet collapse than his own reform efforts (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C particularly between East and,his program of liberal reform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C%20particularly%20between%20East%20and,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>On the international stage, nuclear safety was fundamentally re-examined. Chernobyl was the first nuclear accident to directly result in radiation fatalities (and remains one of only two Level 7 accidents, along with Fukushima 2011). This spurred a wave of new protocols and cooperation. Western and Soviet-bloc experts began collaborating to prevent another Chernobyl. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was established, linking operators from over 30 countries to share safety information and peer reviews (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since 1989%2C over 1000 nuclear,in the Nuclear Power Industry\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since%201989%2C%20over%201000%20nuclear,in%20the%20Nuclear%20Power%20Industry\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

Design changes were rapidly instituted for RBMK reactors – all remaining RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania, etc.) were retrofitted with safety upgrades: e.g. adding neutron absorbers, faster shut-down systems, and eliminating the positive void coefficient at low power (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications have been made to,see Post accident changes\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications%20have%20been%20made%20to,see%20Post%20accident%20changes\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) so that a Chernobyl-type runaway reaction “is now virtually impossible” in those reactors (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). International aid (through organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped finance these safety improvements and the eventual decommissioning of Chernobyl’s other reactors.<br>Public opinion toward nuclear energy also shifted significantly after Chernobyl, especially in Europe. The accident fueled anti-nuclear movements and policy reversals in several countries. For example, in Italy, Chernobyl triggered a national referendum in November 1987 in which over 80% of voters chose to abandon nuclear power; as a result, Italy shut down its existing reactors and scrapped plans for new ones (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C only the widespread popular,a question of individual conscience\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C%20only%20the%20widespread%20popular,a%20question%20of%20individual%20conscience\" target=\"_self\">Nuclear Power, No Thanks! The Aftermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the Nuclear Power Referendum of 1987 | Environment &amp; Society Portal</a>). In West Germany, large anti-nuclear protests took place, and although Germany did not immediately phase out nuclear (that came later), Chernobyl planted seeds of skepticism that eventually contributed to Germany’s decision to end nuclear power by 2022. Other countries like Austria (which had completed a nuclear plant but never fueled it, due to a referendum) felt vindicated. Even far from Europe, Chernobyl had an impact: nations such as the United States and UK reviewed their emergency preparedness; some countries paused or scaled back nuclear projects. The accident underscored that a nuclear disaster is not confined by borders, leading to improved international radiation monitoring networks and emergency response coordination (for instance, the EU created rapid notification systems for nuclear incidents).<br>Geopolitically, Chernobyl also imposed huge economic costs on the USSR (and later Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) – estimated hundreds of billions of dollars over time – contributing to economic stress. Belarus in particular, which received around 70% of the fallout, spent up to 25% of its national budget on Chernobyl consequences in the late 80s and 90s (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In the aftermath of the,Ecology of the Chernobyl Catastrophe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20the,Ecology%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Catastrophe\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More than 1,borne particles drifted to\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More%20than%201,borne%20particles%20drifted%20to\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). This influenced those republics’ politics and relations; for example, arguments over how to pay for Chernobyl recovery were part of the rising tensions in the dissolving Soviet Union. In Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, Chernobyl left a legacy that shaped its environmental and energy policy – the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl (Unit 3) was only shut down in December 2000 as part of an agreement with Western countries that provided financial aid for safer energy projects ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).In summary, the long-term political and geopolitical impact of Chernobyl was far-reaching. It accelerated the end of the Soviet era, prompted a global reckoning on nuclear safety, fostered East-West scientific cooperation, and strengthened international regulatory frameworks. It also invigorated citizen movements and influenced national policies on energy. The world’s nuclear industry after 1986 underwent significant reforms in training, reactor design, risk communication, and emergency planning, all under the shadow of lessons learned from Chernobyl.<br>Right after the explosions, an urgent priority was to extinguish the fires and contain the damage at the power plant. In the early hours of April 26, plant workers and local firefighters rushed to the scene with no full knowledge of the radiation hazard. A fire raged on the roof of Unit 3 (adjacent to the destroyed Unit 4) as well as throughout the wreckage of Unit 4. Fire brigades worked feverishly to douse the flames and keep them from spreading to other reactor buildings. By 5:00 AM, most of the external fires (on the roof and around the building) were extinguished, thanks to these responders – many of whom absorbed massive radiation doses in the process (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). However, inside Reactor 4, the graphite core fire was burning like a giant ember, uncontrollably spewing radiation. It continued to burn for ten days, not fully going out until May 6, 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) when there was no more material left to burn.<br>To combat the reactor fire, the Soviet authorities initiated unprecedented measures. Within 24 hours, the military organized helicopter drops to smother the exposed core. Pilots flew directly over the glowing reactor, dumping load after load of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron into the inferno. In total, more than 5,000 tonnes of these materials were dropped from the air in the weeks after the accident (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). It was an incredibly dangerous mission – roughly 600 Soviet helicopter pilots and crew participated, many receiving high radiation doses as they hovered above the destroyed reactor (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The intent was to choke the fire and absorb neutrons to prevent any renewed nuclear chain reaction. (Later analysis suggests much of the dropped material did not stay in the core but the effort likely helped cool and bury the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).) Firefighters also pumped water into the reactor ruins until fears of a steam explosion in the basement halted that approach. Additionally, teams of engineers drained and vented the plant’s steam suppression pools under the reactor (the “bubbler” pools) to remove water and prevent a potential secondary steam explosion that could have ejected even more radioactivity. This harrowing drain operation required three men to enter radioactive flooded corridors – an oft-cited act of bravery (they survived due to quick work and later medical care).<br>Once the immediate crisis of fire and potential further explosions was under control, the focus shifted to cleaning up the massive radioactive mess – a task that would take years. The Soviet Union marshaled an enormous workforce for this, later known as the “liquidators.” These were civil and military personnel conscripted to liquidate (eliminate) the consequences of the accident. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 600,000 people from all over the USSR were officially recognized as Chernobyl liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). They included firefighters, soldiers, engineers, technicians, miners, medical staff, and even volunteers. In 1986–87 alone, about 240,000 recovery workers were on site (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). Many were young conscripts in the Soviet Army sent to do manual decontamination work.<br>The liquidators’ tasks were varied and often perilous. In the immediate aftermath, one critical job was to clear the highly radioactive debris from the roof of Unit 3 and the surroundings of Unit 4. Chunks of graphite core and reactor fuel had been hurled onto the rooftops and ground. Radiation on the roof was so intense (up to 10,000 R/hour in some spots) that even 1-2 minutes of exposure could deliver a dangerous dose (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Remote-controlled robots were attempted to shovel debris, but most failed quickly due to the radiation frying their electronics. Thus, human soldiers – dubbed “bio-robots” – had to do it. Working in shifts of only about 40 to 90 seconds each, men sprinted onto the roof, shoveled a few scoops of debris over the edge, and ran back, never to return to that spot (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1173 Chernobyl liquidators,cleared from the roof was\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1173%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl liquidators from the military%2C,cleared from the roof was\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl%20liquidators%20from%20the%20military%2C,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Each did only one or two trips. By this method, the rooftops were cleared enough to allow construction of the shelter later.<br>Other liquidator crews decontaminated the ground: they used bulldozers and hand tools to scrape up topsoil, which was radioactive, and buried it in trenches. They washed down buildings, roads, and even livestock to remove fallout. A special substance called “Barda” (a sticky resin) was sprayed over large areas by trucks and helicopters to trap radioactive dust and prevent it from re-aerosolizing (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters regularly sprayed large areas,2018%2C parked in a field\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters%20regularly%20sprayed%20large%20areas,2018%2C%20parked%20in%20a%20field\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). In Pripyat and other evacuated towns, teams went house to house to collect and dispose of irradiated belongings and to euthanize abandoned pets and livestock (to prevent them from spreading contamination). Miners were brought in to tunnel underneath the reactor; they excavated a cavity and poured concrete to create a cooling slab under the smoldering core (“corium”) lava, to prevent it from melting through to groundwater – this prevented a potential groundwater contamination catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of trees were cut down. Contaminated vehicles, helicopters, and equipment were taken out of service – many were buried or dumped in a vehicle graveyard in the Zone (some remain there to this day, rusting and still radioactive (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The official contaminated zones saw,up effort lasting seven\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20official%20contaminated%20zones%20saw,up%20effort%20lasting%20seven\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>)).<br>The liquidators often worked under harsh, hasty conditions with inconsistent protection. Early on, many were not fully informed of the risks. They wore simple cotton jumpsuits or ill-fitting lead aprons and rudimentary respirators, if anything. As time went on, safety measures improved somewhat, but thousands of liquidators exceeded recommended radiation doses (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1258 ,99\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1258%20,99\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The average dose for the ~600k liquidators is estimated at about 120 mSv (12 rem) per person (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>), which is significant (roughly 50 times a typical yearly background dose). Some individuals, particularly those in 1986 roof and core cleanup, received much higher doses (several Sieverts in a few cases). Many liquidators later suffered health issues, and they are honored today for their sacrifice. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus commemorate Liquidators’ Day (often on December 14, the date in 1986 when the reactor was declared sealed) to remember their contributions. These efforts by the liquidators were crucial in reducing the ongoing risk from Chernobyl – they mitigated what could have been a far worse environmental outcome by working to contain and confine the radioactive materials.<br>A monumental engineering task in 1986 was to entomb the destroyed Reactor 4 to stop further radiation release. Immediately after the accident, Reactor No.4 was an open wound spewing radioactivity, so the Soviet government undertook the construction of a massive containment structure known colloquially as the “sarcophagus.” Design work began just weeks after the accident, and construction started in June 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>).

(Some sources cite completion in November, others in early December, but essentially seven months after the disaster.)<br>The sarcophagus was essentially a hastily built steel and concrete shield, erected around the ruins to contain the radiation. It was enormous – over 50 meters tall – and had to be assembled largely by machines and remote welders because radiation levels near the core were deadly. Engineers improvised, often working by remote control or from cranes, to bolt together steel panels and pour concrete over the reactor building’s remains. By its completion, the “Object Ukrytie” (Object Shelter, the official name) encased about 200 tons of radioactive corium (lava-like melted core fuel), plus an estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and debris inside the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building of the Chernobyl Nuclear,1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Nuclear,1\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive contamination of the,1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive%20contamination%20%20of%20the,1\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). This ad-hoc containment prevented these materials from directly escaping to the environment. The sarcophagus also incorporated ventilation to prevent heat and gas buildup, and it sealed off the reactor from rain, which would otherwise leach radioactivity into the ground.<br>Structurally, the sarcophagus was supported in part by the ruined walls of Reactor 4 and was not hermetically tight, but it dramatically reduced radiation emissions from the site. By late 1986, radiation levels around the plant had dropped significantly due to the containment and natural decay of short-lived isotopes. This allowed the other reactors at Chernobyl (Units 1, 2, and 3), which had been shut down after the accident, to be restarted over the next year with added safety upgrades. (They continued operating for years under observation; Reactor 2 was closed in 1991 after a turbine hall fire, Reactor 1 in 1996, and Reactor 3 – the last – in 2000 ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53\" target=\"_self\">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).)<br>The sarcophagus, while a feat given the circumstances, was understood to be a temporary solution with an expected lifespan of perhaps 20–30 years. By the late 1990s, it had deteriorated – the immense radiation and weathering caused cracks and weakened joints. Authorities installed jacks and braces in 1998 to prevent a collapse of the sarcophagus, as it was by then unstable (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Still, it remained an essential barrier keeping the radioactive inventory of Reactor 4 confined. The success of the initial sarcophagus was that it limited the contamination largely within the 30 km Zone and allowed recovery work to continue around the site with manageable radiation levels.<br>Recognizing the sarcophagus was aging, an international plan was developed to provide a more robust, long-term containment. This led to the New Safe Confinement (NSC) – an enormous arch-shaped structure built to enclose the old sarcophagus and reactor building entirely. The NSC was a project funded by a consortium of nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (managed by the EBRD), with design/construction by Novarka (a French-led team). Construction began in 2012. Unlike the original sarcophagus, which was built in place, the NSC was assembled on a clean pad a short distance away and later slid over Reactor 4. By 2016, the colossal assembly was complete, and in November 2016 the entire 36,000-tonne arch was pushed 327 meters on rails to cover the reactor and old sarcophagus (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and preparatory work onsite was,based structure ever built\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and%20preparatory%20work%20onsite%20was,based%20structure%20ever%20built\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling equipment were fitted in,based structure ever built\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling%20equipment%20were%20fitted%20in,based%20structure%20ever%20built\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The NSC is designed to last at least 100 years, with a robust steel frame covered by stainless cladding. It is airtight and equipped with cranes and robotic equipment on the inside. The primary purpose of the NSC is not only to keep radioactive dust from escaping, but also to enable the future dismantling of the dangerously unstable old sarcophagus and the removal of the remaining nuclear fuel and debris inside Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The hermetically sealed building will,using as few personnel as\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20hermetically%20sealed%20building%20will,using%20as%20few%20personnel%20as\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

This will be an extremely challenging task, scheduled to take decades – essentially the final phase of cleaning up Chernobyl.<br>With the NSC in place, the site is far more secure. The new structure prevents water intrusion, controls the environment around the reactor (humidity, etc.), and has filter systems to ensure no radioactive particles leak out during future dismantling work. As of today, the NSC has successfully isolated Reactor 4: radiation levels around the plant have declined further, and the risk of the old sarcophagus collapsing (which could have released dust) is mitigated. In February 2022, during the Russian invasion (discussed later), the NSC’s integrity was maintained despite military occupation of the area. A very recent incident on 14 February 2025 saw a drone strike hit the NSC’s roof, breaching its outer and inner steel panels, but radiation levels remained stable and no radioactive release occurred (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable\" target=\"_self\">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This event underscored the NSC’s importance and resilience.<br>In addition to the NSC, other cleanup infrastructure has been built: for example, a new Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISF-2) was constructed to safely store used nuclear fuel from the remaining Chernobyl reactors, completed in 2020 (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent nuclear fuel storage facility,and cold tests took place\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent%20nuclear%20fuel%20storage%20facility,and%20cold%20tests%20took%20place\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Waste processing plants and monitoring systems have been established to manage the tons of radioactive waste generated by decommissioning and cleanup. The overall containment strategy is now long-term stewardship: maintain the new shelter, gradually dismantle the old one, remove and dispose of radioactive materials in a safe manner, and ensure the surrounding environment is protected.Through these massive efforts – from the bravery of the 1986 liquidators to the high-tech engineering of the NSC – the Chernobyl site has been transformed from an open reactor wreck to a contained and monitored facility. While full remediation (removal of all radioactive material) will take many more decades if not centuries, the risk of another release has been vastly reduced. Chernobyl has gone from an active crisis to a case of long-term containment, serving as a stark lesson and model in nuclear disaster management.Nearly four decades on, Chernobyl today is a very different place than it was in 1986. The reactor is silent and enclosed, nature has reclaimed much of the evacuated zone, and what was once a symbol of nuclear catastrophe has also become a site of scientific study, remembrance, and even tourism. This section covers the current conditions, including radiation levels, the status of the Exclusion Zone, ecological developments, and human activities like tourism and restoration projects, incorporating the latest available updates.<br>Ambient radiation levels in the Chernobyl region have dropped significantly since 1986, due to radioactive decay and cleanup efforts. Immediately after the accident, radiation in close proximity to the reactor could be fatal within minutes. Today, aside from a few hot spots, most of the Exclusion Zone has radiation levels that are within safe limits for short-term visits. For perspective, normal natural background radiation is about 2 mSv (millisieverts) per year (which is ~0.0002 mSv/hour). In much of the Exclusion Zone, current dose rates are only a few times above background or even equal to background in some areas (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). For example, walking around in Pripyat town for an hour might give a dose on the order of a few microsieverts – negligible in health terms. The ghost city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl plant’s perimeter, and main roads have been sufficiently decontaminated or decayed that short visits are not dangerous with basic precautions. The New Safe Confinement ensures that Reactor 4’s remains emit virtually no radiation into the outside environment; all major radioactive materials are contained within sturdy structures.<br>However, radioactive “hot spots” remain in certain parts of the Exclusion Zone, and these are unsafe for extended exposure or habitation. The most notorious is the Red Forest just west of Reactor 4. Radiation there is still extremely high – on the order of 0.4 mSv per hour (400 µSv/h) in some patches, which is “thousands of times higher than background levels and dangerous to live in” (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). A person standing in the Red Forest for an hour could receive as much radiation as they normally would in several months. Needless to say, nobody is allowed to linger there, and it’s off-limits to tourists (even driving through the area, guides take care to roll up windows and not stop). Other localized hot spots include some parts of the reactor complex’s vicinity, areas where radioactive metal equipment lies in the open, or where fallout concentrated in 1986. These spots are well-mapped by authorities; warning signs mark areas of higher radiation.<br>Importantly, the radiation today is not uniform – it’s very heterogeneous. While one spot might be 0.4 mSv/h, a few hundred meters away it might drop to 0.004 mSv/h. Overall, chronic radiation levels have “plummeted” compared to the initial aftermath, and wildlife and even occasional workers can exist in the zone with only low-level exposure outside the hotspots (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether chronic radiation has any,chronically exposed to low levels\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether%20chronic%20radiation%20has%20any,chronically%20exposed%20to%20low%20levels\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Long-lived isotopes like cesium-137 have undergone over one half-life since 1986, meaning roughly half of the initial amount has decayed away. Shorter-lived isotopes (iodine-131, xenon-133, etc.) disappeared long ago. The areas that remain dangerous are primarily those with concentrated transuranic elements (like parts of the reactor debris with plutonium) or where cesium and strontium were deposited most densely (e.g. forest floor litter).<br>As of today, experts consider the Exclusion Zone safe for controlled access – scientists, workers, and tourists routinely enter for limited periods. The key is limiting time in higher-dose areas and not ingesting any contaminated materials (no eating berries or mushrooms from the zone, for example, as they concentrate radionuclides). The Ukrainian authorities have an extensive radiation monitoring network on-site. According to reports, even after incidents like forest fires or military occupation (more on that below), radiation levels remained “within normal limits” for the zone and did not pose a danger outside the immediate area (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion\" target=\"_self\">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>A recent real-world “stress test” of Chernobyl’s stability occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl site and occupied the Exclusion Zone for about five weeks. During that time, there were concerns about disturbances to radioactive soil. Indeed, Ukrainian officials reported a spike in gamma radiation readings, likely because Russian military vehicles churned up contaminated dust in the Red Forest with their movements (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion\" target=\"_self\">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The episode highlighted that Chernobyl, while largely safe and stable, is still a sensitive site that needs protection. It also demonstrated the resilience of the New Safe Confinement and other systems – they withstood the human disruptions without releasing radiation.<br>Another very recent event was the February 2025 drone strike mentioned earlier. A drone (attributed to Russian forces amid the ongoing conflict) detonated on the roof of the NSC. It managed to puncture the outer and inner steel layers of the NSC’s roof in one spot (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable\" target=\"_self\">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This was a serious incident, but the redundancy of the NSC’s design meant that even with those holes, no radioactive dust escaped. The IAEA confirmed that radiation levels inside and outside the structure stayed normal (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable\" target=\"_self\">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). Repairs are presumably planned to maintain full integrity. This event underscores that while the radiological condition of Chernobyl is under control, human factors and security remain relevant to its safety.In summary, Chernobyl is not a ticking time bomb now, but a contained contaminated site. Current radiation levels in most areas pose minimal risk for brief exposures, and the worst areas are well-restricted. There is no fission or reaction occurring – the reactor fuel is inert and cooling for decades. The main ongoing safety focus is monitoring and managing the remaining radioactive materials to prevent any environmental release (especially during future fuel removal operations). With the new shelter and strong institutional oversight (even during conflict, international eyes like the IAEA are watching Chernobyl), the site’s condition is stable. It is safe enough for scientists, workers, and even tourists, provided regulations are followed, but it remains unsafe for normal habitation or unrestricted land use in the foreseeable future.The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is the officially designated area that surrounds the nuclear plant, from which routine habitation is excluded due to contamination. It was initially a 30 km radius circle, but over time it has been adjusted to cover the regions of highest fallout. Today, the CEZ in Ukraine spans roughly 2,600 km² (1,000 sq miles), an area nearly the size of Luxembourg. It is a mix of forest, marsh, and abandoned villages and towns. To the north, across the border, Belarus maintains its own 2,200 km² Polesie State Radiation-Ecological Reserve – effectively an extension of the Exclusion Zone. Combined, the whole Chernobyl affected zone is about 4,300–4,400 km² of mostly evacuated land. Within the Ukrainian CEZ, the borders are secured by patrols and checkpoints. One cannot simply wander in; access is controlled by the Chernobyl Zone Authority under Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.<br>The zone remains almost completely devoid of permanent residents. In the chaotic months after the disaster, some residents—especially older folks—were heartbroken at the thought of never returning to their homes. Despite official prohibition, a number of evacuees later snuck back into the Exclusion Zone and resettled in their old villages. These people are known as the “samosely” (self-settlers). Over the years, authorities generally tolerated their presence in small numbers. At their peak in the late 80s and early 90s, around 1,200 samosely lived in the zone; today (as of the 2010s), only an aging few dozen to a couple hundred remain, as many have passed away due to old age (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most of those\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most%20of%20those\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). These residents live mostly in the outer parts of the zone, subsisting off gardens and pensions – they often say they’d rather face radiation in their beloved homes than live in alien cities. They do receive occasional visits from doctors and supplies, but for the most part they live simply and accept whatever risk exists. Their presence is a poignant human facet of the zone, though they are a tiny exception.For everyone else, the Exclusion Zone is a strictly controlled area. The infrastructure of the zone consists of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant industrial site (where a few thousand workers and security personnel commute for monitoring and projects, working in shifts but not living there), and the town of Chernobyl (about 15 km south of the reactor). The town of Chernobyl (not to be confused with the plant itself) actually still functions as an administrative center for the zone – a few hundred staff, scientists, and officers live there on rotations. It has dormitories, an operational canteen, and even two small hotels for visitors. However, this is not a “normal” town – it’s more like a base camp, since everyone there is on limited stay and monitored for radiation dose.The rest of the zone is characterized by abandoned settlements. Pripyat, once a model city of 50,000, remains empty and decaying – an urban time capsule of Soviet life in 1986. Dozens of villages similarly lie in ruins or are being reclaimed by vegetation. Over 200,000 hectares of the zone are wild land with no active human use. There are checkpoints at the 30 km and 10 km boundaries where dosimeters are used to check vehicles for contamination on exit.<br>Economically and administratively, the Exclusion Zone has been put to some new uses in recent years (covered under “Tourism and Development” below, like solar farms and scientific research). But its status is essentially that of a restricted environmental reserve. In 2016 Ukraine designated the Exclusion Zone as a national biosphere radiological reserve, recognizing its unique environment. There has even been discussion by Ukrainian officials of seeking UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Pripyat and Chernobyl’s cultural landscape, to preserve it as a memorial and scientific site. (In 2021, on the 35th anniversary, Ukraine formally started the process to nominate the CEZ as a World Heritage Site (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible Unesco World Heritage Site\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible%20Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site\" target=\"_self\">Ukraine Seeks to Designate Chernobyl as a Unesco World Heritage ...</a>), though the war has interrupted these plans.)The security of the zone came under threat during the 2022 Russian invasion, as noted. For the first time, armed conflict intruded into the CEZ. During the Russian occupation, not only was there concern of accidental damage, but also reports of looting (even theft of radioactive lab samples) and disruption of wildfire management. Post-occupation, Ukraine has to demine parts of the zone due to mines left behind. The episode highlighted that the Exclusion Zone remains important strategically – it was a pathway for Russian forces towards Kyiv. After Russian withdrawal, Ukraine reasserted full control and the zone is back to being off-limits except for authorized personnel. The IAEA now has a permanent monitoring presence at Chernobyl as well.In conclusion, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone persists as a largely evacuated territory. It functions as a combination of a radiological reserve, an outdoor laboratory, a memorial landscape, and a buffer around the reactor site. With each passing year, the zone’s identity shifts more towards preservation and research. It stands as a remarkable example of how a large area, once meant for human habitation, has transformed following a technological disaster. Current conditions ensure that the zone will remain set apart for many years to come – a place where time stopped in 1986, now gradually being reclaimed by nature, and cautiously visited by those seeking to understand and remember Chernobyl’s lessons.One of the most intriguing aspects of Chernobyl today is its thriving wildlife and transformed ecosystem. As mentioned in the long-term effects section, the removal of humans has allowed many animal populations to rebound dramatically. The Exclusion Zone has effectively become a wildlife sanctuary – arguably one of the most unexpected nature preserves in the world.<br>Surveys and field research in the 2010s documented an abundance of large mammals. Wolves are considered the top predator in Chernobyl’s food chain now, and they range freely. A 2015 census using track counts and helicopter surveys found that Chernobyl’s wolf population was several times higher than in nearby non-contaminated reserves; prey like deer and wild boar were also plentiful (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The researchers reported “no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance” in the zone, noting that wildlife was doing well in the absence of people (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). This is not to say radiation has no effects, but any potential subtle effects have not prevented populations from growing. Another study published in 2015 in Current Biology concluded the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a “unique sanctuary for wildlife” with greater biodiversity than before the accident, due to human absence (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).Numerous species have returned to the area. For instance, the Eurasian lynx, absent in the region for decades due to hunting and habitat loss, now prowls the forests again. Brown bears have been observed moving through the zone (these had long been gone from this part of Ukraine). The European bison, an endangered species, was introduced to the Ukrainian zone in the 2010s and has since formed a small herd. Przewalski’s horses – critically endangered wild horses native to Central Asia – were released in the late 1990s as an experiment; they thrived and now about 100 of them roam the grasslands near Pripyat, grazing around abandoned villages. Elk (moose) populations are stable, and wild boar are so numerous that they spill out of the zone into surrounding farmland. Birdlife is rich as well: species like black storks, white-tailed eagles, eagle owls, and others are commonly seen. Even rare species like the globally threatened Greater Spotted Eagle have been recorded nesting in the zone. The wetlands in the Pripyat River floodplain inside the CEZ serve as important habitat for migratory birds. Lakes and ponds hold healthy fish populations (famously, the cooling pond of the plant has giant catfish that tourists love to watch – though their size is due to age and lack of fishing, not “mutations”).<br>Scientists continue to study these animals to see how chronic radiation exposure might be affecting them. Some findings are intriguing: for example, Chernobyl’s birds have been found to adapt by producing more anti-oxidants to counter radiation’s oxidative stress. A study on Chernobyl’s wolves has even tracked them leaving the zone, suggesting the zone might be a source of animals repopulating other areas (raising the question of whether they could carry mutations outward – though no evidence of any harmful spread has been observed). Another recent study (2023) on roundworms in the soil found that even after 1,000 generations in Chernobyl’s radionuclide-laden earth, the worms showed an ability to tolerate the radiation without significant genome damage (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the resurgence of a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the%20resurgence%20of%20a\" target=\"_self\">From disaster zone to living laboratory: Chernobyl provides test bed ...</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation,genomes of microscopic worms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny%20Worms%20Tolerate%20Chornobyl%20Radiation,genomes%20of%20microscopic%20worms\" target=\"_self\">Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation - NYU</a>). This hints at potential resilience or repair mechanisms developed by life in the zone.That said, not every creature is thriving. Invertebrates and small mammals have shown mixed results in studies – some have reduced populations in high radiation sectors. Tree growth can be stunted in those areas. There have been reports of some partial “mutations” or anomalies: for instance, a higher frequency of albino barn swallows, or rodents with cataracts. But overall, the ecosystem functions: trees grow, leaves decompose (albeit slower at first), water bodies have oxygen and life, and a full trophic web (plants → herbivores → carnivores) is in place.The Exclusion Zone’s ecology has also benefited from deliberate protections. Since people aren’t farming or logging, forests have matured and expanded. In Belarus’s Polesie Reserve, there are large tracts of primeval-feeling forest that are home to lynx and wolves. Ukraine’s side set up the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve to coordinate ecological conservation and research.<br>Interestingly, the zone provides a case study on rewilding – showing how quickly wildlife can reclaim an area when humans leave. Within 5-10 years of the evacuation, animals from surrounding regions started moving in. Now, Chernobyl is cited as evidence that nature can be remarkably resilient. The United Nations Environment Programme noted that the land around Chernobyl has become “a haven for wildlife” in the absence of human activity (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers have found the land,become a haven for wildlife\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20the%20land,become%20a%20haven%20for%20wildlife\" target=\"_self\">How Chernobyl has become an unexpected haven for wildlife - UNEP</a>). Some have even called it Europe’s own Serengeti (though that’s hyperbole; it is a rich temperate forest ecosystem, not a tropical savanna).It’s crucial to remember the wildlife success does not mean radiation is “good” for animals – rather, it underscores how damaging human habitation can be for wildlife, by comparison. Chernobyl removed the anthropogenic pressures (hunting, farming, pollution other than radiation), and wildlife moved in despite the radiation risk. The long-term genetic consequences for these animal populations are still being studied. But as of now, the biosphere of Chernobyl is vibrant. Visitors often report seeing tracks of wolves and boar everywhere, hearing bird songs in empty villages, or even catching sight of a wild horse galloping across the steppe. It’s a striking contrast: a site of human catastrophe has, over time, transformed into an “accidental wilderness.”<br>In summary, the current ecosystem in the Chernobyl area is a mixture of contamination and regeneration. Forests have overtaken former towns; animals roam where people once worked and played. The zone stands as a unique refuge for biodiversity in Eastern Europe, with higher wildlife abundance than before 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Ongoing research in this living laboratory will continue to inform us about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation on living organisms and about nature’s capacity for resilience after human departure.In recent years, Chernobyl has evolved into a destination for controlled tourism and a site for innovative projects aimed at finding some positive purpose for the Exclusion Zone. Disaster tourism, or “dark tourism,” has grown around Chernobyl, driven by curiosity, education, and the eerie allure of its post-apocalyptic landscape. At the same time, Ukraine has launched efforts to utilize the zone for renewable energy and scientific advancement, turning a place of tragedy into one of renewal.<br>Tourism: In 2011, Ukraine officially opened Chernobyl to tourism, recognizing the public interest and the zone’s educational value (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2011 Chernobyl was officially,tourist attraction%2C with many visitors\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202011%20Chernobyl%20was%20officially,tourist%20attraction%2C%20with%20many%20visitors\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Since then, visiting Chernobyl has been possible via licensed tour operators. Tourists must apply in advance, submit their passport details (since it’s a secure area), and they enter on guided tours usually from Kyiv. These tours stick to relatively safe routes; visitors carry dosimeters and are briefed on safety (like not touching vegetation, not sitting on the ground, etc.). Typical tours include stops at the Chernobyl town (to see memorials and equipment graveyards), the Kopachi village ruins (where only a kindergarten building remains as a reminder), the Pripyat city (where one can carefully walk the deserted streets and see sites like the abandoned amusement park, swimming pool, and overgrown city square), and a distant view of the Reactor 4 complex and NSC from a safe distance. Some tours also visit the giant Duga-1 radar (“Russian Woodpecker”) – a huge abandoned Soviet radar installation in the zone. Tourists pass through radiation control gates when exiting to ensure they haven’t inadvertently picked up contamination (in practice, brief visitors rarely do).<br>Chernobyl tourism remained somewhat niche until the late 2010s when it saw a boom. The success of the 2019 HBO “Chernobyl” miniseries brought a surge of interest – tour agencies reported bookings jumping by 30-40% after the show aired (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One Chernobyl tour agency reported,which has attracted outstanding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One%20Chernobyl%20tour%20agency%20reported,which%20has%20attracted%20outstanding\" target=\"_self\">HBO show success drives Chernobyl tourism boom - Reuters</a>).

These visitors come from all over the world, drawn by historical interest, a taste for adventure, or even wildlife photography. The Ukrainian government even considered expanding tourist infrastructure given the demand.Tourism has had positive effects: it raises awareness of the disaster’s lessons and provides income (each visitor pays fees that support zone maintenance and local communities outside the zone). Guides emphasize that Chernobyl is a site of remembrance – there are memorials to firefighters and evacuees, and many tours include meeting an actual evacuee or a liquidator who can share their story. Visitors are often struck by the poignancy of places like Pripyat: an empty nursery with children’s toys still there, or murals peeling off school walls – snapshots of 1980s Soviet life frozen in time. This “open-air museum” aspect is why preservationists have pushed for UNESCO status, to protect it from decay and looting.Tourism was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again in 2022 because of the war. As of 2023, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tourist access is suspended for security reasons. But prior to that, Chernobyl had firmly established itself as a tourist destination, and it likely will again when conditions normalize. It’s not a Disneyfied experience – the trips are somber and heavily managed – but it provides a powerful insight into nuclear history and its consequences.Restoration and Development Projects: While the land will be unsafe for farming or regular habitation for a long time, Ukraine has sought creative ways to utilize the Exclusion Zone. One idea has been to turn it into a hub for renewable energy. The reasoning: the zone has abundant land that cannot be used for agriculture, and it has existing high-voltage power lines (from when the plant generated electricity) that connect to the grid. So, why not install solar panels or wind turbines there?<br>In 2018, the first project materialized – a 1 megawatt solar power plant was built within sight of the old reactors (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The new one,first years of its operation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The%20new%20one,first%20years%20of%20its%20operation\" target=\"_self\">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Installed by a Ukrainian-German company, this solar farm consists of about 3,800 photovoltaic panels on a 1.6 hectare plot, right near the Chernobyl plant. It was connected to the grid and, symbolically, began generating power again at Chernobyl (the first electricity from the site since the last reactor shut down in 2000) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It is the first time,would never produce energy again\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20first%20time,would%20never%20produce%20energy%20again\" target=\"_self\">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). This small solar station powers about 2,000 homes, and plans were floated for expansion. The Ukrainian government has actively promoted the Exclusion Zone as a site for renewable energy projects, pitching that up to 2.5 GW of solar capacity could eventually be installed (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area\" target=\"_self\">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).

The cheap land (effectively free, since it’s unusable for other purposes) and existing transmission lines make it economically attractive – with the caveat that construction workers can only spend limited hours in the area for safety (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two years ago%2C a giant,reactor to be dismantled safely\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20giant,reactor%20to%20be%20dismantled%20safely\" target=\"_self\">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).<br>Similarly, in 2021 Ukraine announced plans for a large wind farm in the Exclusion Zone. In partnership with a European company, they envision up to 1 GW of wind energy capacity to be developed in the zone (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear option%3A Ukraine plans one,around the Chernobyl nuclear plant\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear%20option%3A%20Ukraine%20plans%20one,around%20the%20Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant\" target=\"_self\">Nuclear option: Ukraine plans one of Europe's largest wind farms in ...</a>). If realized, that would make it one of Europe’s biggest onshore wind farms. Such a project would further transform Chernobyl from a symbol of nuclear disaster into a contributor to clean energy production (without the risks of nuclear). As of the latest updates, these plans are on hold due to the war, but Ukraine has indicated strong interest in resuming them once it’s safe.Besides energy, the zone is used for scientific research and environmental monitoring. Ecologists, biologists, and radiologists from around the world work in the CEZ to study radiation effects on nature, remediation techniques, and even astrophysics (the low light pollution makes it good for certain telescopic observations). There have been projects to test robotic equipment for radiation mapping, to experiment with phytoremediation (using plants to extract radionuclides from soil), and to monitor wildfires via satellites. The zone’s administration also employs people in forestry (they actively manage some forests to reduce fire risk, by removing dry fuel). Some contaminated wood is harvested under careful conditions and used as biomass fuel in special power plants (with filtration) outside the zone – a bit controversial, but an attempt to utilize resources while controlling pollution.One notable “restoration” in a cultural sense is the preservation of certain buildings. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself still has workers doing decommissioning. Tours can visit the control room of Reactor 4 now (in full gear, for a short 5-minute look) – it was opened to very limited visiting in 2019 as part of raising awareness. The control room is, of course, contaminated and everything inside remains as it was after the accident (now with higher radiation levels), so such visits are symbolic. There is also the Chernobyl Museum in Kiev (Kyiv) which is outside the zone but dedicated to its history.One can’t mention restoration without noting that Chernobyl will never be “restored” to its pre-1986 state in the literal sense. The goal is more about containment and adaptation. The current strategy (per international plans) is to keep the reactor area safe and start removing the fuel debris between now and 2065, package the waste, and then possibly begin to dismantle the NSC and other structures after that. Meanwhile, large parts of the Exclusion Zone may be left to nature indefinitely. Some areas with lower contamination could potentially be opened for limited use sooner – for example, a few outer villages were reclassified in the 2010s to allow former residents to visit or even live with some restrictions (particularly in parts of Belarus). But for the most contaminated core zones, the “no man’s land” will persist for many generations – essentially as a wildlife reserve and historical monument.Latest updates (as of early 2025): The war in Ukraine has introduced uncertainties – for instance, the renewable projects are paused, and the zone occasionally faces security issues. But the NSC and other safety systems are functioning. Ukraine’s government remains committed to integrating the zone into its future plans (President Zelensky in 2020 declared Chernobyl a place of “special importance” that should be turned from a negative into a positive symbol). There’s talk of developing better infrastructure for tourists and researchers once it’s feasible.Chernobyl has also become part of global pop culture and education. Documentaries and movies abound. The site draws not only tourists but also journalists, scientists, and even video game designers (the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is set in a fictionalized Chernobyl zone). This human engagement with Chernobyl today is part of its ongoing story – ensuring that the lessons of 1986 are not forgotten and that maybe something constructive can arise from the tragedy.<br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was a cataclysmic event with causes rooted in design flaws and human error, producing immediate devastation to human life and the environment. Its immediate consequences included loss of life, widespread radioactive contamination, and political upheaval. Over the long term, it has had complex health outcomes (notably thousands of thyroid cancers, but surprisingly limited other health impacts according to UNSCEAR) (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), and it left a profound mark on ecology – decimating some aspects of the environment while inadvertently creating a wildlife haven. The disaster also influenced geopolitical currents, hastening the Soviet Union’s end and reshaping global nuclear policy.Cleanup efforts were unprecedented in scale – from the half-million liquidators who risked their health, to the massive engineering feats of containment with the sarcophagus and New Safe Confinement. Today, Chernobyl stands in a state of stable containment: radiation is largely confined, Reactor 4 is entombed under the new arch, and the area is under constant monitoring. The surrounding Exclusion Zone has transformed into a unique sanctuary for biodiversity and a living museum of the anthropocene. Current radiation levels in most of the zone are low enough to allow visits, although the land will not be fully “clear” for normal life for centuries in the most affected parts.<br>Chernobyl’s story is still unfolding – it’s a story of warning about the dangers of nuclear power without proper safety, but also a story of resilience (of people and nature). Efforts continue in making the site useful – whether generating solar electricity or providing invaluable scientific data on radiation’s effects. As of today, Chernobyl is both a monument to a past disaster and a dynamic environment of recovery. It remains a sobering reminder of the costs of human error, and a testament to international cooperation in mitigating a disaster’s aftermath. The legacy of Chernobyl is reflected in safer nuclear industry practices (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a\" target=\"_self\">Chernobyl Accident 1986 -

I considered telling you that I would practice skills for you, so you don’t have to practice them. But then I realized that if I did, you would not learn how to be skillful yourself. So, instead, I wish you skillful means, and I wish that you find these skills useful.”&nbsp; Facilitate Mindfulness Guessing Item Activity: Start by educating on mindfulness (observing, describing, participating, being non-judgmental, one-mindful, and effective). Explore how these aspects of mindfulness will be integrated into the activity. Put items into a bag. Go around the room, everyone closes their eyes except the describer. The describer describes the item you gave them starting with broad descriptions and moving into more specifics. I usually write on the board types of descriptions in case the person gets stuck such as the shape, purpose, feel, color, weight, size, texture, smell, taste, etc. As the describer begins describing the object, the rest of the group begins guessing what it is, until some gets it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Wise Mind Activity:&nbsp; Provide psychoeducation regarding what is emotion mind, rational mind, and wise mind.&nbsp; Invite clients to draw what it looks like for you to be in rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Wise Mind Activity: [SKIP]&nbsp; Chain of commitments to wise mind: cut slips of paper, write or draw descriptions of wise mind, hand the chains in your room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise:&nbsp; Ask group members to identify one thing in their life right now that they know they need to accept.

We want to honor and acknowledge those differences but also brings to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. This process might prove difficult or awkward. This is about getting to know each other and breaking down stereotypes. You can choose if and how you participate. This acticity is simple. Each one of us will read a statement. If the statement is something you have experienced, you cross the line. We will then reset and read the next statement. This exercise has to be done in complete silence.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to help students become more aware of the many types of diversity that exist and to find students who share the same experiences. For this exercise, students form a line across the classroom. Students are asked to step forward and then back into the line based on questions asked by the instructor. Start with questions that are non-threatening to get students comfortable with the exercise. Students can choose to “pass” if they want. Vary the questions to suit your group of students. Listening: Let’s have silence throughout the exercise – no talking, snickering, giggling, etc. Silence will allow all of us to participate fully. Silence will also enable us to experience our personal thoughts and feelings more deeply. Respect: It is imperative that we respect the dignity of each person who is here. Everything that is shared should remain confidential. Nothing that is offered should leave this room. Each statement will require you to make the decision crossing the line or not crossing the line. There are no right or wrong answers. NO PRESSURE. No one here is under any pressure to respond in any particular way to any of the questions. If you have any doubts about sharing some part of yourself, you should feel perfectly comfortable with your decision not to step forward.\nWhat kind of feelings did you have as you participated?\nHow did you feel when there were fewer of you on one side of the room?\nHow did the movement of others influence you?\nWhat did you learn through this activity that can make our group more welcoming. Walk across the line if your favorite color is blue. Look into the eyes of those you brought with you. Look at those you left behind. Allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling. Walk back across the line.\nQuestions: You prefer the city. You have visited another country. You have never flown. You know very little about your cultural heritage. You are the oldest in your family. You have lost someone you loved. You are from Ohio. You enjoy sports. You are an only child. You got picked on in school. Your parents divorced. You consider yourself a religious person. You prefer Coke to Pepsi.\nYou prefer vanilla to chocolate.\nYou have been in love\nYou have had surgery. You have lived in another state. You know someone who has been sexually assaulted. You have felt alone, unwelcomed, afraid. You knew someone who has attempted to die by suicide. You have cried at least once this year for someone or something other than yourself. You or someone you know is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. You have been a bystander to a racial, sexual, or cultural joke. You have read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. You did not cross the line in a previous statement when you should have. You are willing to understand, support, and celebrate diversity. If you have not crossed the line during this activity, cross it now. Here are some additional questions: Walk across the line if you have ever experienced a bad hair day.\nWalk across the line if you are undecided about your major. Walk across the line if your parents are divorced. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is in a gang. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about lives in poverty. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about has been homeless. Walk across the line if you have been told or think you are fat. Walk across the line if someone you care about has been abused physically, psychologically, or sexually. Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is dependent on alcohol or drugs.\nWalk across the line if you know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Walk across the line if you know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDS. Walk across the line if you have been put down by someone else and it hurt you. Walk across the line if you put someone down and you knew it hurt them. At the conclusion of this exercise, ask students what they learned from it.

Pass the bowl around and have each person take one item. Mindfully observe the piece of fruit for a few minutes. When the bell rings everyone puts the fruit back into the bowl and then see if each person can \"recognize\" their original fruit.\nInstructions: First take your piece of fruit and weigh it up in your hands. Get a sense of the texture of the skin, the temperature, the weight, how it feels in the palm of your hand, how it feels as you run your fingertips across its surface. What do you notice here? Spend a few moments doing this.\nNext, we are going to use our sense of smell to breathe in the scent of the fruit. What do you notice here? Try to stay with just sensing the fruit, perhaps notice if your mind begins to make associations.\nYour mind will likely wander or begin thinking about things as you move through this exercise, so just notice make a note of these thoughts, and come back to paying full attention using your five senses.\nNext, take a good look at the fruit. Noticing its visual qualities - color, shape, any irregularities, the stalk, surface texture. Just take it in - looking for details. Keep an eye out for any tendency to make comparisons or judge the fruit! You'd be surprised how often our mind rushes to judgements.\nYou could try next bringing the fruit up to your ear and listening to the sound it makes when you squeeze it or tap it. What sound does a fruit make? (I'll bet you never wondered that before!)\nNext, take a few moments to feel your fruit. Noticing how it feels. Is it smooth? Is it rough?\nBring the practice to a close when you are ready.\nWhen you are finished, it's good to reflect on the exercise... what did you notice? Was anything surprising? Where did your mind go? What do you miss when you are on autopilot? How might the skill of mindfulness and observing be helpful to you in your daily life? Under what circumstances might you use this skill?

Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. Chronic, severe, persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations: Temper outbursts: These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others).\nThey must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion 3) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria 5 and 6). Chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion 4) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Consistent gender difference in prevalence have not been reported in population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance. The diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (6-18 years).\nChildren with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. A relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of: <br><a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Major Depressive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Major Depressive Disorder</a> Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A family history may be a risk factor. Those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The same behavior deficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. Socioeconomic factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as post-conflict zones or communities affected by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and transitory. While irritability has a strong genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role. Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common. <br>Differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from <a data-href=\"Bipolar Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bipolar Disorder</a> and <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> requires particularly careful assessment. <br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and <a data-href=\"Bipolar Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bipolar Disorder</a> s in children involved longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child. During a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baselines. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. The irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder required severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. <br>In only approximately 15% of individuals with <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. There is a more prominent mood component among individuals with mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. It should also be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood patterns. Children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. Children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual's mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice-weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. These two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. <br>The strongest overlap is with <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. <br>If children have symptoms that meet criteria for <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> or <a data-href=\"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a> and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.

Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"\nDepression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.\nTo be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.\nThere are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances. Includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities. (Also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder)\nConsists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years. Depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression. Depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. A severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see). Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributed to another medical condition) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others 9 e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\nMarkedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)\nSignificant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\nInsomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\nPsychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\nFatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\nDiminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)\nRecurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The episode is not attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria 1-3 represents a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., <a data-href=\"Bereavement\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bereavement</a>, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion 1, which may resemble a depressive episode. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity.\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: Major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. Specify if: With anxious distress (pg. 210-211)\nWith mixed features (pg. 211)\nWith melancholic features (pg. 211-212)\nWith atypical features (pg. 212)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (pg. 213)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (pg. 213)\nWith catatonia (pg. 213) [Coding Note: Use additional code F06.1]\nWith peripartum onset (pg. 213)\nWith seasonal pattern (applies to pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes) (pg. 214) Major depressive disorder is defined by the presence of at least one major depressive episode occurring in the absence of a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day, nearly every day (Criterion 1). The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes: Changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity\nDecreased energy\nFeelings of worthlessness or guilt\nDifficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. To count toward a diagnosis of a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared with the individual's pre-episode status. The symptoms must occur nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation, which must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs to occur once. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly increased effort. The presenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest. The failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near delusional guilt.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps' (Criterion 1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, 'not caring anymore,' or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion 1.2)\nFamily members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations. In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion 1.3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion 1.3). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too ealry and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume)\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is Depression?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Depression?_0"},{"heading":"Types of Depression","level":3,"id":"Types_of_Depression_0"},{"heading":"Major Depression:","level":4,"id":"Major_Depression_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)\" href=\"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Persistent_Depressive_Disorder_(Dysthymic_Disorder)]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Perinatal Depression\" href=\"Perinatal Depression\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perinatal Depression</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Perinatal_Depression]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\" href=\"Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Seasonal_Affective_Disorder_(SAD)]]_0"},{"heading":"Depression with Symptoms of Psychosis:","level":4,"id":"Depression_with_Symptoms_of_Psychosis_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic Criteria:","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_Criteria_0"},{"heading":"Coding and Recording Procedures","level":3,"id":"Coding_and_Recording_Procedures_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic Features","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_Features_0"}],"links":["clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/perinatal-depression.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html#_0",".html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412060516,"modifiedTime":1742962300255,"sourceSize":9919,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Major Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/other-specified-depressive-disorder.html":{"title":"Other Specified Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/other-specified-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412133059,"modifiedTime":1742962301842,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Other Specified Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/other-specified-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/perinatal-depression.html":{"title":"Perinatal Depression","icon":"","description":"\nPerinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy.

Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The word “perinatal” refers to the time before and after the birth of a child. Perinatal depression includes depression that begins during pregnancy (called prenatal depression) and depression that begins after the baby is born (called postpartum depression). Mothers with perinatal depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that may make it difficult for them to carry out daily tasks, including caring for themselves or others. The “baby blues” is a term used to describe mild mood changes and feelings of worry, unhappiness, and exhaustion that many women sometimes experience in the first 2 weeks after having a baby. Babies require around-the-clock care, so it’s normal for mothers to feel tired or overwhelmed sometimes. If mood changes and feelings of anxiety or unhappiness are severe, or if they last longer than 2 weeks, a woman may have postpartum depression. Women with postpartum depression generally will not feel better unless they receive treatment. Perinatal depression is a real medical illness and can affect any mother—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Women are not to blame or at fault for having perinatal depression: it is not brought on by anything a mother has or has not done. Perinatal depression does not have a single cause. Research suggests that perinatal depression is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Life stress (for example, demands at work or experiences of past trauma), the physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby, and changes in hormones that occur during and after pregnancy can contribute to the development of perinatal depression. In addition, women are at greater risk for developing perinatal depression if they have a personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder or if they have experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mental illness that occurs after childbirth. PP is a medical emergency, and it is important to seek help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Women who have PP can have delusions (thoughts or beliefs that are not true), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling things that are not there), mania (a high, elated mood that often seems out of touch with reality), paranoia, and confusion. Women who have PP also may be at risk for harming themselves or their child and should receive help as soon as possible. Recovery is possible with professional help. Some women may experience a few symptoms of perinatal depression; others may experience several symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of perinatal depression include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood\nIrritability\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\nFatigue or abnormal decrease in energy\nFeeling restless or having trouble sitting still\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\nDifficulty sleeping (even when the baby is sleeping), awakening early in the morning, or oversleeping\nAbnormal appetite, weight changes, or both\nAches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause or do not ease even with treatment\nTrouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with the new baby\nPersistent doubts about the ability to care for the new baby\nThoughts about death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby Treatment for perinatal depression is important for the health of both the mother and the baby, as perinatal depression can have serious health effects on both. With proper treatment, most women feel better and their symptoms improve.\nTreatment for perinatal depression often includes therapy, medications, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may be an option to explore. Several types of psychotherapy can help women with perinatal depression. Two examples of evidence-based approaches that have been used to treat perinatal depression include <a data-href=\"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> and interpersonal therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help people with depression and anxiety. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations. People learn to challenge and change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior as a way of improving their depressive and anxious feelings and emotions. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar concerns. IPT is an evidence-based therapy that has been used to treat depression, including perinatal depression. It is based on the idea that interpersonal and life events impact mood and vice versa. The goal of IPT is to help people to improve their communication skills within relationships, to develop social support networks, and to develop realistic expectations that allow them to deal with crises or other issues that may be contributing to their depression. Women with perinatal depression are most commonly treated with antidepressants, which are medications used to treat depression. They may help improve the way the brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should notify their health care provider before starting antidepressants so their&nbsp;health care provider can work to minimize the baby’s exposure to the medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take antidepressants during pregnancy is very low; however, women should work with their&nbsp;health care provider to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and to find the best solution for their situation. Women may need to try several different medications before finding the one that improves their symptoms and has manageable side effects.\nAntidepressants take time—usually 6 to 8 weeks—to work, and symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give medication a chance before deciding whether or not it works.\nDo not stop taking antidepressants without the help of a health care provider. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. When a woman and her health care provider have decided it is time to stop the medication, the health care provider will help her to decrease the dose slowly and safely.\nAfter the birth of a child, many women experience a drop in certain hormones, which can lead to feelings of depression. FDA has approved one medication, called brexanolone, specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. Administered in a hospital, this drug works to relieve depression by restoring the levels of these hormones. It is important to understand that depression is a medical condition that impacts the mother, the child, and the family. Spouses, partners, family members, and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of perinatal depression in a new mother. Treatment is central to recovery. Family members can encourage the mother to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.\n<br>Support or advocacy groups can offer a good source of support and information.

The signs and symptoms of SAD include those associated with depression as well as disorder-specific symptoms that differ for winter-pattern versus summer-pattern SAD.\nSymptoms of depression can include: Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks\nFeelings of hopelessness or pessimism\nFeelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\nDecreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\nChanges in sleep or appetite or unplanned weight changes\nPhysical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment\nThoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts For winter-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Oversleeping (hypersomnia)\nOvereating, particularly with a craving for carbohydrates, leading to weight gain\nSocial withdrawal (feeling like “hibernating”) For summer-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include: Trouble sleeping (insomnia)\nPoor appetite, leading to weight loss\nRestlessness and agitation\nAnxiety\nViolent or aggressive behavior Winter-pattern SAD should not be confused with “holiday blues”—feelings of sadness or anxiety brought on by stresses at certain times of the year. The depression associated with SAD is related to changes in daylight hours, not the calendar, so stresses associated with the holidays or predictable seasonal changes in work or school schedules, family visits, and so forth are not the same as SAD. To be diagnosed with SAD, a person must meet the following criteria: They have the symptoms of depression or the more specific symptoms of winter- or summer-pattern SAD listed above.\nTheir depressive episodes occur during specific seasons (winter or summer) for at least 2 consecutive years. However, not all people with SAD experience symptoms every year.\nTheir depressive episodes during the specific season are more frequent than depressive episodes experienced at other times of the year. It is estimated that millions of Americans experience SAD, although many may not know they have this common disorder. In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.\nSAD occurs much more often in women than in men. Winter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-pattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people living farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in the winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England are more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida.\nSAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves repeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes (less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I disorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other mental disorders, such as <a data-href=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href=\"Eating Disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Eating Disorders</a>, <a data-href=\"Anxiety Disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Anxiety Disorders</a>, or <a data-href=\"Panic Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Panic Disorder</a>. <br>SAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common in people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, such as <a data-href=\"Major Depressive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Major Depressive Disorder</a> or <a data-href=\"Schizophrenia\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schizophrenia</a>. Researchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most research to date has investigated potential causes of winter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier to study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern SAD, and more research is needed.\nStudies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-pattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also suggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help maintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may prevent these molecules from functioning properly, contributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.\nVitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in people with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is believed to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin D consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the winter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, further reducing serotonin activity.\nOther studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to altered levels of melatonin—a hormone important for maintaining the normal sleep−wake cycle. People with winter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can increase sleepiness and lead to oversleeping.\nIn contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have reduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days worsening sleep quality and leading to depression symptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high temperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, these theories have not been systematically tested.\nBoth serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body’s daily rhythm tied to the seasonal night−day cycle. In people with SAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal daily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to seasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and behavior changes.\nNegative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer and its associated limitations and stresses are also common among people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, however, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the mood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment. Treatments are available to help people with SAD. They fall into four main categories that can be used alone or in combination: Light therapy\nPsychotherapy\nAntidepressant medication\nVitamin D Light therapy and vitamin D are treatments for winter-pattern SAD, whereas psychotherapy and antidepressants are used to treat depression in general, including winter- and summer-pattern SAD. There are no treatments specific to summer-pattern SAD. Since the 1980s, light therapy has been a mainstay for treating winter-pattern SAD. It aims to expose people with SAD to a bright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in darker months.\nFor this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright light box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30−45 minutes, usually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light box, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor light, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making this a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain eye diseases or people taking certain medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative treatments or use light therapy under medical supervision. Psychotherapy can help people with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that contribute to depression.\n<br><a data-href=\"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a type of psychotherapy aimed at helping people learn to challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive and anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with SAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in two weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing negative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts about the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with more positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called behavioral activation, which helps people identify and schedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to offset the loss of interest they typically experience in the winter or summer.\nWhen researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light therapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving SAD symptoms—although some symptoms got better slightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a long-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters found that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer. Medications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can be effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with talk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress.&nbsp;\nAntidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work. Problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may need to try several medications to find the one that works best.\nBecause SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with disturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly enhance a person’s mood.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release form designed to last longer in the body. For many people, bupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive episodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring. Because many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. However, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD have produced mixed results, with some studies indicating that it is as effective as light therapy and other studies finding no effect. Because the onset of SAD is so predictable, people with a history of the disorder might benefit from starting the treatments mentioned above before the fall (for winter-pattern SAD) or spring (for summer-pattern SAD) to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms. To date, few studies have investigated whether SAD can be prevented.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is Seasonal Affective Disorder?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Seasonal_Affective_Disorder?_0"},{"heading":"What are the Signs and Symptoms of SAD?","level":2,"id":"What_are_the_Signs_and_Symptoms_of_SAD?_0"},{"heading":"How is SAD Diagnosed?","level":2,"id":"How_is_SAD_Diagnosed?_0"},{"heading":"Who Develops SAD?","level":2,"id":"Who_Develops_SAD?_0"},{"heading":"What Causes SAD?","level":2,"id":"What_Causes_SAD?_0"},{"heading":"How is SAD Treated?","level":2,"id":"How_is_SAD_Treated?_0"},{"heading":"Light Therapy:","level":3,"id":"Light_Therapy_0"},{"heading":"Psychotherapy:","level":3,"id":"Psychotherapy_0"},{"heading":"Antidepressant Medication:","level":3,"id":"Antidepressant_Medication_0"},{"heading":"Vitamin D:","level":3,"id":"Vitamin_D_0"},{"heading":"Can SAD be Prevented?","level":2,"id":"Can_SAD_be_Prevented?_0"}],"links":["clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html#_0","clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html#_0","university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["media/school-diagrams/prevalence/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html"],"createdTime":1705375082038,"modifiedTime":1742962309428,"sourceSize":11193,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad).html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/substance-or-medication-induced-depressive-disorder.html":{"title":"Substance or Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/substance-or-medication-induced-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412127006,"modifiedTime":1742962311404,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Substance or Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/substance-or-medication-induced-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/unspecified-depressive-disorder.html":{"title":"Unspecified Depressive Disorder","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/unspecified-depressive-disorder.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706412136268,"modifiedTime":1742962313465,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Mental Health Conditions/Mood Disorders/Depressive Disorders/Unspecified Depressive Disorder.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/unspecified-depressive-disorder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html":{"title":"Bipolar Disorder","icon":"","description":"\nBipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.

Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity (over-activity).

The median age of diagnosis for severe ADHD was 4 years. The median age of diagnosis for moderate ADHD was 6 years.\nThe median age of diagnosis for mild ADHD was 7 years. Approximately one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. Medication can be used to effectively treat ADHD symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity, and is the single most effective treatment for reducing ADHD symptoms.\nFigure 2 is based on data from the NSCH and shows medication use among children with ADHD in 2011. An estimated 69.3% of children with a current diagnosis of ADHD received medication for ADHD.\nMedication use increased 4% overall from 2007 to 2011, particularly among male teens.\nFigure 2: <img alt=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/prevalence/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).png\" target=\"_self\"> Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey–Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), Figure 3 shows the lifetime prevalence of ADHD among U.S. adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.

Balancing the Three Principles: <br>According to the <a data-href=\"Belmont Report\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belmont Report</a>, \"These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects.\"\nIn some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit) Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects: <br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href=\"Belmont Report\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review: IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.\nWhenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons). Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations: Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. <br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the <a data-href=\"Belmont Report\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belmont Report</a>. . Informed Consent: People have the right to expect that researchers will treat them as autonomous individuals, respecting their decisions about whether to take part in research and about what personal information they will or will not share with others. This is accomplished through a thorough informed consent process that is presented in a language understandable to the research subject. The Consent Process: The federal regulations about informed consent list elements of information that the researcher must provide to subjects. The regulations divide the elements into two categories. One category includes basic elements to be provided to all subjects. The second set includes elements that must be provided, when appropriate. Consent should begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a subject in understanding the research, what is expected of them, and the potential risks of harm and benefits. Regulations require that this information be understandable to the subject and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. The emphasis on subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) comprehension and presenting information that a 'reasonable person' would want to have in order to make an informed decision to participate, and providing an opportunity to discuss. This 'key information' is not defined in the regulation, but examples of key information were provided in the preamble to the revised Common Rule: The fact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary. The purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective subject's participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research. The reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the prospective subject. The benefits to the prospective subject or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research. Appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the prospective subject.

Suicidal crises are often brief. While some attempts follow a long period of deliberation, other attempts are acted on hastily and may be difficult to predict. Most people who attempt suicide don't necessarily want to be dead, but they want the pain they feel to stop. Most people who attempt suicide and survive do not ultimately kill themselves - even people who make a very serious suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Crisis: The period when a person transitions from being at risk for suicide or considering suicide to being ready to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;make an attempt. Can come on rapidly\nCan be difficult to predict\nCan lead to an unplanned suicide attempt\nPeople were asked when they has first started thinking about making an attempt; 48% said they starting thinking about it within 10 minutes of attempting. Often brief The period during which a person is actually ready to take their life is usually brief. Rarely is it a chronic state. The impulse to die often fades. It may never recur, or it may flare up episodically. Duration of Suicidal Crisis: Evidence by Attempters: 0-10 minutes: 48%\n11-60 minutes: 2%\n1-24 hours: 9%\n1-7 days: 16%\n1-4 weeks: 15%\n1-12 months: 11% Long-Term Survival: More than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not actually kill themselves. 60% of people who commit suicide die on their first attempt. (Means reduction saves lives by decreasing the likelihood that an attempt will be fatal) In describing the moment he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, Ken Baldwin said, \"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped.\" It is not easy to determine. Examples: Clients who have suicidal thoughts. Clients who are in distress and have attempted suicide in the past. Clients who are struggling with mental health or substance misuse issues, especially if they are also coping with painful life crises. A clinician should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and feelings. Talking about suicide does not create or increase risk, in fact, it can reduce the risk of suicide. A clinician’s ability to calmly, compassionately, and matter-of-factly explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors may encourage an individual to disclose suicidality, if it exists. Often, clients who have considered suicide will be relieved that you raised the subject. Use direct questions about current or past suicidal thoughts and behavior. Let the client know that other people have similar thoughts and feelings.\nAny of your clients who have a prior history of suicidality or current distress could benefit from lethal means counseling. If your conversation with your client results in disclosure of past suicidal thoughts or behaviors, probe more about current suicidal feelings. Find out specific details about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Some Questions to Ask: Tell me about a couple of times in the past few months when things were the worst for you—did you think about suicide? If yes, then ask:&nbsp;Did you take any specific steps toward an attempt? What methods did you think about? What kept you alive?&nbsp; Tell me about the last couple of days—how much would you say suicide has been on your mind, if at all?&nbsp; If so, then ask:&nbsp;Are there specific methods you’ve thought about? Have you thought about how you'd kill yourself?&nbsp; If yes, then ask: Have you thought about when or where you'd kill yourself?\nIf they mention a specific method of suicide, then ask: What other methods are you thinking about? Is there a specific scenario where you think you would attempt suicide?\nHave you ever attempted suicide in the past, or started to? Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Lethal means counseling makes sense for anyone at risk.\nIndividuals who struggle with mental health and/or substance use issues, and who are experiencing a major crisis, stress, or trauma, are also at risk of suicide and should receive lethal means training. Individuals who currently have suicidal thoughts would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress would benefit from lethal means counseling. Individuals who struggle with mental health/substance abuse issues, especially when they are also experiencing painful life crises, would benefit from lethal means counseling. Ask clients at risk directly about suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Ask clients at-risk specifically about their suicide plans, such as how and when they would do it. Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. People sometimes deny these even when they exist. Also, suicidal thoughts can emerge rapidly and many attempts are unplanned. Lethal means counseling should take place before a suicidal crisis occurs. Firearms is the method used most frequently in suicidal deaths. Suicidal Death Rates by Method: 51% Firearms\n26% Suffocation/Hanging\n12% Poisoning/Overdose (Poisoning from intentional drug or medication overdoses)\n3% Gas Inhalation (Inhaling gas, usually carbon monoxide from motor exhaust)\n2% Jumping/Falling (Jump from high place like bridge)\n2% Cutting (Sharp instruments like razor)\n4% Other Methods (like drowning) The lethality of the method used in a suicide attempt is one of the biggest factors determining whether the person lives or dies. While the intent matters, means also matters. If the method a person wants to use for suicide if not available when they are actually ready to go through with an attempt, one of two things is likely to occur: They will delay the attempt as they try to get access to the method they want to use. The greater the delay, the greater the chance the suicidal crisis will pass. They will substitute another method. If the substituted method is less lethal, this increases the chance the person will not die. And most people who survive an attempt do not later go on to kill themselves. The two methods used in the majority of nonfatal suicidal attempts are overdosing with medications and cutting with sharp instruments. Many people think these two methods are far more deadly than they actually are. This misperception may save a lot of lives.\nWe recommend that you do not share specific information with your clients about the low lethality of sharp instruments and medications. Which suicide methods are amenable to a means reduction approach? It depends on the following criteria: Number of Suicide Deaths: The number/percent of suicide deaths caused by a specific method. Lethality: The proportion of attempts by a given method that end in death (case fatality rate). Irreversibility: The inability for someone attempting suicide to stop once it has begun or to be rescued. More people stop an attempt than carry through with it. Accessibility: The immediate availability of the method. Access is particularly important when attempts occur rapidly with little or no planning. Acceptability: Cultural and/or individual tolerance or preference for using a particular method to kill oneself. Cutting: Low Number of Deaths\nLow Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nHigh Acceptability Jumping/Falling: Low Number of Deaths\nHigh Lethality\nHigh Irreversibility\nLow Accessibility\nLow Acceptability Gas Inhalation: Low Number of Deaths\nModerate Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nModerate Accessibility\nLow Acceptability Poisoning/Overdose: Moderate Number of Deaths\nLow Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nHigh Acceptability Suffocation/Hanging: Moderate Number of Deaths\nModerate Lethality\nLow Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nModerate Acceptability Firearms: High Number of Deaths\nHigh Lethality\nHigh Irreversibility\nHigh Accessibility\nHigh Acceptability Firearms are used in more suicide deaths in the US than all other methods combined. They are also highly lethal irreversible, and easily accessible in many homes with guns (one-third of homes have guns). Since gun owners can voluntarily undertake steps to reduce access, you will want to discuss safe firearm storage with all clients at-risk of suicide. Medication Overdoses are not as lethal as firearms (though some medications and poisons are very lethal). It is also usually possible for someone to stop an overdose mid-attempt or to be rescued. However, overdose is by far the most frequent method of attempt, and medications are easily accessible in most homes. Therefore, it is wise to routinely advise at-risk clients to dispose of unnecessary medications and keep accessible only quantities that do not pose a lethal threat. When your client's suicidal ideation focuses on any other method, you will want to discuss with them ways to reduce access to that method. More suicide deaths are from firearms than any other method in the US. Firearms, jumping, and suffocation are most lethal than other methods. Cutting and poisoning/overdose have low lethality, on average. The method used in a suicide attempt can determine whether the person lives or dies. Use a method reduction approach for any lethal method that is mentioned by clients at risk. How amenable each method is to a means reduction approach depends on the following criteria: Frequency\nLethality\nIrreversibility\nAccessibility\nAcceptability Since firearms are used in most suicide deaths and they are also highly lethal, acceptable, and accessible (in homes with guns), be sure to ask all clients at risk if they have access to firearms and discuss ways to reduce access. A method is considered lethal if a high proportion of attempts by that method end in death.\nApproximately 80%-90% of intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates.\nOnly 1%-2% of intentional, self-inflicted wounds from sharp instruments, like a razor, are fatal. Cutting is not a highly lethal method. However, it is the second most commonly used method in attempts. Only 1%-2% of intentional overdoses or poisonings are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates. This is on average, however, certain medications and poisons are far more lethal than others. In addition, medication overdoses are the most common method of suicidal attempts. People who attempt suicide typically struggle with ongoing mental health or substance abuse issues.\nWhile some attempts are planned, many are not. Acute suicidal crises are often brief, and escalation from thought to action can occur rapidly.\nThe lethality of the method used in an attempt can determine whether that person lives or dies. If a highly lethal means is not available, the individual's chance of survival is greater. Over 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not take their life later on, so reducing access to lethal means can save many lives.\nAn effective way to protect clients at risk of suicide is to reduce their access to highly lethal means before they experience an acute suicidal crisis. Feasibility: Can the client or their family actually take the steps at home to reduce access to the method? Reducing access to&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;and&nbsp;medications used for poisoning/overdose&nbsp;could feasibly be accomplished at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so could potentially save thousands of lives in the U.S. if routinely implemented with people at risk for suicide.\nAccess can be feasibly be reduced for these two methods: Firearms: Firearms are used in roughly half of all suicide deaths, are highly lethal, and are very accessible if they are kept at home. Medications: Medication overdoses are by far the most common method in suicide attempts. Although the vast majority do not result in death, some medications and medication combinations are highly lethal - and, if kept unlocked at home, very accessible. We recommend routinely discussing firearm and medication storage with all clients at risk of suicide. If a client's suicidal ideation focuses on a method other than firearms or medication, we also recommend discussing ways to reduce access to that method as well. When discussing firearm storage with clients and their family members, the goal is to maximize the client’s safety by reducing immediate access to firearms as much as possible while they are at risk for suicide. There are two main options for reducing access to firearms.\nSafest: Store firearms away from the home: Storing firearms away from home is the most effective way to ensure clients don't have easy access to a gun if they experience a spike in suicidal feelings. Off-site options are listed in the next section. Second-best: Secure storage inside the home: The second-best option is securely locking firearms in the home (or disassembling guns and locking a critical component). The person at risk should not have the keys, know where the keys are kept, or know the combination to the storage unit. Keep in mind that safes and locks can be broken into or picked, some more easily than others. But any measures that put time and distance between a suicidal person and a firearm may save their life. Storing firearms away from the home temporarily until the person improves is the best way to reduce access to them. Self-Storage Rental Units: Many facilities allow firearm storage. Typically, the smallest units are 5 ft. By 5 ft., but some offer storage drawers or bins, which are less expensive. Prices typically include a small one-time administrative fee as well as a monthly charge that depends on unit size. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored in a facility. Friends or Relatives: Storing firearms with a trusted person is an excellent and free option, provided the person is legally allowed to hold them. Some state laws require a background check prior to transfer to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing firearms. Shooting Ranges: Shooting ranges and sportsmen’s clubs sometimes offer locker rentals for a relatively low monthly fee. Typically, only the owner holds the key and no background check is required because the ownership of the guns is not transferred. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored. Law Enforcement: Some law enforcement agencies will temporarily store firearms for safety purposes; others will not. It is best to know the processes and policies in your region before you need to implement these with a client. You or your client should contact the agency first; walking in unannounced with firearms could be mistaken as a threat. Some agencies will pick up the firearms at the person’s home. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required. Most agencies offer disposal services, if that is desired. Gun Shops: Some gun shops offer storage services, and a few specialize in this service (e.g., provide pick-up services, offer discounts for longer-term and multiple gun storage). Prices vary, although some shops will provide regular customers with free storage when there is a safety concern. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required, depending on the type of storage the shop uses. Pawn Shops: Pawning guns for a small loan amount can be a relatively low-cost, secure storage option in most states. Interest charges must be paid monthly. To reclaim their firearms, gun owners must repay the loan and go through a background check to verify they are not prohibited from owning firearms. Clients and family members who decide to store their firearms away from their house usually want to know when it’s safe enough to bring their firearms back into the home. \"Yes. … It’s a case-by-case decision based on how the client is doing. Acute suicidal feelings can spike episodically. While these spikes are often brief, they can recur. It is prudent to wait until there has been a relatively long period of stability before returning the guns.\" Temporary storage of firearms away from the home cannot always be arranged immediately and isn’t always acceptable to the client or others in the home. Store in a gun safe or lock box: Lock guns, unloaded, in a gun safe or lock box. Many gun owners have multiple guns and ALL of them should be locked up, including rifles and self-defense guns. Remove a component: Remove a key component of the guns (such as the slides or firing pins) and lock them up - or better yet, store them away from the home. Use Gun Locks: Trigger locks, cable locks, and clamshell locks aren't as safe as locking in a secure gun safe, but they are better than not locking it at all - and when used in conjunction with a safe, can provide an additional layer of protection. Change the Combination or Key: If guns are already locked, change the combination or key location in case the person at risk knows how to access them. Remove Ammunition: Remove ammunition from ALL firearms. Keep all ammunition out of the home for now - or, at least, locked separately. Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.\nWe recommend triple safety when storing them in the home: Locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked up separately (Ideally away from the home while the client is at risk)\nWhat About a Self-Defense Gun? In some situations, clients or members of their household may want to keep their gun available for self-defense purposes. If this is the case, how you approach the situation and what you say will depend on whether the gun owner or the household member is the person at risk. Person At Risk: If the gun owner is the person at risk: Discuss the specific threats that are a concern to the client and the realistic risk of home invasion crimes.\nFind out what other means of protection they would consider, such as self-defense sprays (if legal in your state), flood lights, an alarm system, or a dog.\nDiscuss what they are willing to do to keep themselves safe from suicide.&nbsp;\nWould the client consider locking a self-defense gun and having another family member hold the key? If there’s resistance, consider creative solutions, such as putting pictures of loved ones or other reminders of reasons to live on their gun or lock box to interrupt or slow down a suicidal impulse. Work toward additional steps to reduce access over time. Household Member: If the gun owner is a member of the household: First, discuss the probabilities of suicide attempt versus risk of home invasion in the near term (i.e., the risk of a violent home invasion is very small for most people and is dwarfed by the far greater risk of suicide if a despairing person has a gun close at hand)\nIf the gun owner is concerned about protecting family members, it may be helpful to mention that part of protecting them is keeping everyone safe from suicide.\nIf self-defense is determined to be essential, one option is for the gun owner to keep the firearm either on them or in a quick-release handgun safe to which the person at risk has no access. Overdose accounts for roughly two-thirds of suicide attempts treated in the hospital, but only a very small proportion (2% or less) prove fatal. However, some medications are more dangerous than others, especially when taken in combination. With over 250,000 attempts annually, at least 5,000 people die each year from an intentional overdose. According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the medications most frequently involved in overdose suicides are opioids (e.g., prescription pain medications such as oxycodone, methadone, and morphine). 5&nbsp; In suicide deaths by drug overdose, over half tested positive for an opioid. 6&nbsp;Opioids, when used alone or in combination with other types of drugs or alcohol can cause death by depressing the respiratory system. Other drugs that are frequently implicated in overdose deaths include benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolytics and muscle relaxants), antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping pills (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially diphenhydramine—Benadryl), and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). These substances usually do not appear alone but rather in combination with an opioid, with one another, and/or with alcohol. Alcohol use can increase the lethality of an overdose and may increase the risk that the person will carry through with an attempt.\nUnfortunately, information about lethal combinations of medications is readily available on the Internet. Safely dispose of all unneeded and outdated medication in the home. Opioids should not be kept at home unless absolutely necessary to manage pain. If opioids must be kept at home, they should be locked and inaccessible to the person at risk. If the at-risk client must take the opioids to manage pain, discuss the possibility of having another household member or support person dispense the pills. In high-risk situations involving opioid use, also keep at least two doses of Narcan Nasal Spray, which is a highly effective rescue drug that lay people can administer. When used in time, Narcan can immediately reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Always lock up abuse-prone drugs such as prescription painkillers, anxiety medications, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Many inexpensive lock boxes can easily be broken into. A steel toolbox secured by a padlock is a safe, inexpensive option. For other necessary medications (both over-the-counter and prescription), only keep on hand limited quantities that would not constitute a serious danger if taken together. Lock up the rest. Advise families to ask their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what constitutes a safe quantity of medication to have in their home. The Poison Control Hotline at 800-222-1222 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) can also provide guidance on safe quantities. A family member or support person should seek this information, not the person at risk for suicide, since the information could be used to increase the lethality of an attempt. Use lower-toxicity rather than higher-toxicity medications, if possible, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant rather than a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant. Limit medication to quantities and combinations that, even if taken all at once, will not do serious harm. Consider requiring weekly refills to reduce lethality and increase contact.\nTake into account the client's use of alcohol and other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. Some combinations are more deadly than others. If you have a client with a prescription for psychiatric medications, choose your words carefully so that you don’t send mixed messages or inadvertently inform the person about the lethality of the medications. If a client’s suicidal thoughts focus on methods other than guns or medications, incorporate those methods into your lethal means counseling. For example, if ideation focuses on filling the garage with car exhaust or crashing the car into a telephone pole, and the client has strong suicidal feelings, discuss ways to limit access to the car, such as having a family member hold onto the car keys temporarily.\nWhat if ideation focuses on a certain method? There are times when a client’s ideation focuses on a very specific method that serves as their escape plan and may also have personally significant meaning. For example, your client carries around a belt that he could use to hang himself like his uncle did. If ideation focuses in this very specific way on one particular item, work with the client on agreeing to give up that item for now, while identifying strategies for staying alive. What about methods that cannot easily be restricted at home? Sometimes a client’s ideation focuses on suffocation or other highly lethal methods that are nearly impossible to control access to. These clients may need close supervision from family, friends, or others to ensure they don’t attempt suicide, particularly if their suicidality is of a more chronic or recurring nature. The client may opt to stay in a hospital if they feel the supervision would be helpful. Just One Part of a Safety Plan: In all cases, reducing access to lethal means should be part of a broader collaborative safety plan aimed at helping a client learn how to cope with suicidal feelings, as well as part of a broader therapeutic plan aimed at reducing the reasons for dying and increasing the reasons to live. To reduce access to firearms, the safest option is to store them away from the home. Possible storage options include with a relative or friend; with law enforcement; in a self-storage rental unit; or at a gun shop, shooting range, or pawn shop.\nTo reduce access to firearms that are stored in the home, use triple safety measures: Lock all firearms (or disassemble guns and lock a critical component), unload all firearms, and lock ammunition separately (or don’t keep ammunition at home for now).\nHiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.\nGuns that are kept at home for self-defense must be addressed since they are usually the ones that are most accessible. To reduce access to medications, remove unneeded medications from the home; keep only non-lethal quantities on hand; and lock up abuse-prone drugs, such as prescription painkillers, anxiety pills, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Discuss ways to reduce access to any method a client mentions using. Since escalation to a suicidal crisis can happen rapidly, the goal is to make the home safer for clients at risk before they are actively suicidal. Counseling on access to lethal means is for three types of clients:\nClients who have recently had suicidal thoughts.\nClients who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress. Clients who are struggling with a difficult mental health or substance abuse issue, particularly when they are also coping with a life crisis, such as relationship breakup, housing dislocation, arrest, or financial or job problems. These clients may not be currently suicidal but could become suicidal quickly. Routinely discus ways to reduce access to firearms and medications routinely with any client at risk of suicide. In addition, discuss any other method that a client with suicidal ideation considers using. Lethal means counseling is a client-centered intervention, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Your approach and the language you use are important to making this conversation effective, whether speaking to your client or to their friends and family members. Have a collaborative conversation and work together. With this approach, the client is the expert and the clinician is a resource. Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis as well as the need to reduce access to lethal means. Make specific and feasible plans. Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences. A guiding approach that is collaborative and client-centered is usually best, such as that used in motivational interviewing. Seek input from the client about their own reasons for - and against - reducing access, their own safety concerns, and what they would be willing to do. A collaborative approach accepts the client's values and works from the client's own motivations. \"I can see how hard this has been for you lately, and I'm concerned about you. Are you concerned too?\"\n\"What ideas do you have about ways to increase your safety in case you experience suicidal thoughts?\" If your client is a gun owner: \"Lots of people have guns at home. Some will store their guns outside of their home temporarily - such as at a relative's house or a gun shop - until they are feeling better. What do you think about a strategy like that?\" A directive approach has a less collaborative tone and puts the clinician in the role of the expert. With certain clients, this approach may be more appropriate, for example: Clients who are too overwhelmed or stressed to make clear-headed decisions. Clients from certain cultures who may feel more comfortable getting advice rather than being asked for their ideas. Examples of Directive Statements: \"I'm going to recommend that for now you store your guns away from home. Is that something you can do?\"\n\"You'd be safer if you stored your guns away from home for now.\"\n\"I'm going to suggest you use this gun lock and have your wife keep the key.\"\n\"It would be best if you kept only a week's supply of medications at home and had a family member store the rest.\"\n\"For now, let's have your partner store your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in a lock box.\" No Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts: Some clients may disclose that they are suffering but say they are not suicidal. This may well be true for some clients; however, others may in fact be suicidal or likely to become so. If the client is having a very difficult time, and especially if life stressors are also present (e.g., custody battle, painful breakup, upcoming prison sentence, housing dislocation, work troubles), engage them in a conversation about reducing access to firearms and medications in case suicidal feelings develop.\nExamples of how to respond to clients who say they are not suicidal: \"I'm glad you're not feeling suicidal right now. Sometimes people who are struggling may have a crisis and suddenly experience strong suicidal feelings. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but if it does, I want to be sure you make it through safely and get the help you need. Can we talk over a plan, just in case?\" When clients you suspect are suicidal don't disclose: \"It's not unusual for people who have experienced the kind of pain you are going through recently to feel like it will last forever and to think they would rather be dead. Can we talk over a plan for how you'd stay safe if you started feeling suicidal?\" Some clients, even if they are suicidal, may express resistance to reducing access to lethal means, like firearms. If clients or family members seem resistant, listen to what they say and work collaboratively toward solutions that address their concerns. For instance, some gun owners find the idea of living without a firearm in the home, even temporarily, very difficult. Don’t minimize that this may be a difficult decision. Examples on how to respond to clients who are in denial or resistant: When clients won't tell you whether they have a gun: Will you tell me what you’re worried would happen if you say you have a gun? I may be able to ease those worries. When clients think you are trying to take their gun away: \"I am not questioning your right to own guns. Since you’ve talked about feeling suicidal, I’m concerned about helping you stay safe. Have you also been concerned?” When clients are concerned about what will go in their record: “Before we talk about your specific situation, I can let you know what sort of information I will write down and what I can omit.” When a client is concerned about chronic pain: “I hear that you are concerned you won’t have access to your medications during a flare-up. Let’s come up with a plan that supports both your health and safety.” When a family member is resistant to safely storing medications at home: “While it is true your child could get pills from a store, most suicide attempts occur at home with little or no preparation. Let’s talk about a plan that addresses your concerns and also ensures your daughter cannot take enough pills to harm herself.” Conversations about reducing access to lethal means are not always straightforward or easy. This can be especially true when discussing firearms. As a clinician, if you own guns you may feel more at ease raising the topic and more knowledgeable about storage options. If you aren’t a gun owner, it’s possible you might feel uneasy broaching the topic or overestimate client resistance. However, most gun owners value firearm safety and protecting their family—values that dovetail well with preventing suicide. When firearms are a family tradition and bonding experience: Consider alternatives\nDiscuss safety\nStore guns elsewhere When guns provide safety and protection: Weigh concerns: Weigh the safety concerns of suicidality versus the concern of temporarily not having a firearm at home. Consider other options: Consider other things that could help keep the family safe such as pepper spray, alarms, or outdoor motion-detector lighting. Prioritize client's health: Underscore that part of protecting the client's family is ensuring the client is alive and well. Discuss behavioral history: Ask about any history of impulsive or unexpected behavior, and build on that to reinforce your concern. When guns provide security due to PTSD: Ask how client feels: Ask if the client trusts themselves with a loaded gun close at hand. Consider behavioral strategies: Use a behavioral intervention (e.g. behavioral modification, behavior shaping, rehearsal) or other interventions that focus on taking small steps to reduce access and gradually increasing these steps. Talking to Parents/Guardians: When working with a person under age 18 who is at risk for suicide, involve parents or guardians. Let them know that you are concerned about a possible suicide attempt and explain that reducing access to lethal means can reduce the likelihood of a suicide death.\nWhen the youth has expressed suicidal ideation: “The fact that your child has had suicidal thoughts means we need to take the risk of suicide seriously. We’ve talked about getting him into treatment. I’d also like to talk about steps you can take at home to help keep him safe.”\n\"If a child or teenager attempts suicide, it’s usually at home and it’s often a quick decision. Putting time and distance between them and a method that could do serious harm is one of the single most effective steps to protect your child.\" When the youth is not currently suicidal but at risk: “I’ve asked her about suicidal thoughts, and she hasn’t disclosed any. Suicide is still a concern when kids are struggling. These thoughts can develop rapidly, often without warning, and can prompt an unplanned suicide attempt. Therefore, we routinely suggest a few important steps you can take at home.”\n\"With everything going on in your home right now and the impact on your child, it is best to make the environment in your home safer in case a suicidal crisis occurs unexpectedly. It is safest to temporarily remove all firearms from the home and to reduce access to medications, particularly those for pain and other drugs of abuse, while your child is at risk.\" Since firearms are the leading cause of suicide deaths, be sure to talk with the youth and their parents/guardians about guns in the home. Gather information from youth: Talk to your young clients about whether there are guns in the home and find out if they have access to them.&nbsp;For example, some clinicians ask youth, “How long would it take you to get access to guns in your home?”\nTalk to the parents about gun access and storage:\nSpeak to the adult in the household who is the primary gun owner (unless there are contraindications such as spouse abuse).&nbsp; Find out the following: How are the guns stored in the home? Since gun owners often have more than one, gather information about all of them.\nDoes their child have access to any of the guns in the home? Many parents underestimate their children’s knowledge about where guns are stored and how to access them (e.g., key or combination).&nbsp;\nAre there other homes where the youth stays that may have guns? Discuss all possibilities, such as joint custody situations, relatives, hunting buddies, or other friends.\nMake sure the youth cannot hear your discussion (even if it is by phone), especially if there’s a chance the child is unaware of household firearms. Explain the focus on firearms, if necessary: If parents ask why you are focusing on firearms, explain that they are the most lethal method of suicide and that unlike nearly every other method, there’s no opportunity for the person to change their mind or be rescued mid-attempt. Since suicidal feelings are often short-lived and can come on unpredictably, putting time and distance between an at-risk youth and firearms is an effective way to protect them. Lethal means counseling is client-oriented. When discussing lethal means with clients or family members, make it a collaborative conversation. Your approach and the language you use matters. A collaborative, guiding approach is usually best. A more directive approach is less collaborative but may be more appropriate with certain clients. When working with a young person at risk for suicide, always involve parents or guardians. Together with your client, collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means. Depending on the client’s situation, this plan usually covers firearms and medications, as well as any other methods that are the focus of your client’s ideation.\nThe plan should include the following: Clear roles and tasks: Who will do what (this is especially important to do if others are involved) A timetable: When each part of the plan will be done Family members may not be aware that suicide attempts usually occur with little or no planning and that the method a person chooses often depends on its availability. It can be helpful to inform family members or significant others and to enlist their support in reducing access to lethal means, for example, if there are medications which the client must access daily or occasionally. Benefits: Involving family can be very effective. In fact, families counseled to remove or secure lethal means are far more likely to do so than those who are not counseled. Additionally, results of a pilot study indicate the majority of families reported that the counseling they received was respectful of their needs. Considerations: Some clients will not want you to enlist the help of their family members. In these situations, close friends or peer mentors may be more acceptable and less risky to involve than family members. Collaborate with your client on who would be best to engage.\n- Permission:\n- Ask your client for permission to talk with others before doing so (e.g., spouse, romantic partner, parents, friends, or peer mentors). For minors (under age 18), you may talk to the parents or legal guardian without the client’s permission. To help maintain your relationship with a minor, however, be sure to inform your client before speaking with a parent or guardian.\n- Permission Denied:\n- If a client does not give you permission to talk with anyone, yet you believe that removal of a lethal means is necessary for the safety of that individual, this could be considered permissible communication. Consult the current HIPAA guidelines for situations like this.\n- Remember, in order to collaborate effectively with a client (or their parents), the clinician should:\n- Use language that indicates acceptance of gun ownership without judgement.\n- Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis and the need to reduce access to lethal means.\n- Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences, recognizing that gun owners tend to prefer language that emphasizes options and autonomy. Consider the Client's Reaction: Before finalizing a plan to reduce access to firearms, or any suicide method, consider your client's reactions to it and the likelihood of follow-through with the plan. If you are working with the parents or guardians of youth, take their reactions into consideration. The client’s (or parents’) response may reveal whether the plan is likely to be carried out. Examples: Initial reluctance from client: Is your client initially reluctant to implement the plan and then relieved when they agree? This may indicate strong commitment to that particular method and a positive indication that, for now at least, they are electing to live. Readily agreeable client: If your client readily agrees to give up access to means and puts up no resistance, you may need to be a little suspicious. Sometimes lack of resistance means that the person is already considering a substitute method or holding something back. For example, the client may be thinking, “Okay, now that I don’t have guns, I’ll just use pills.” If you have doubts, say something like, “Thank you for your help on this. Now I’m wondering what other means you’ve considered and if those means are available to you.” Mixed messages from family members: If you are working with family members and one member is agreeable but the gun-owning family member seems reluctant, this may indicate a lack of commitment by the gun owner to follow through with the plan. Monitor Progress: Document and Monitor: Once you've arrived at a mutually acceptable plan for reducing access to lethal means, document it in your notes. Access to lethal means: For all persons identified at risk for suicide, indicate that you have assessed for specific access to lethal means. Recommendations and Steps: List any recommendations and steps agreed upon with the client to reduce access to lethal means and make the environment safer. Contact with Others: Indicate if you contacted family members or a support person to confirm the removal or securing of lethal means. If the client or family has engaged law enforcement, a pharmacy, or others to hold or dispose of lethal means, this should be documented in the medical records. One way to ensure that lethal means counseling becomes a standard component of working with people at risk of suicide is, where possible, to build prompts into electronic templates and paper forms that serve as a reminder. For example, systems that use electronic medical records can embed specific lethal means documentation into templates for intake assessments, crisis appointments, therapy or medication appointments, and many other appointment types. Recommendations for Follow-Up: Never assume that the agreed-on plan will go as intended. Follow-up is essential. Suggestions for monitoring progress: Make follow-up calls Call to check on progress and assess how the client is doing. Or ask the client or family member to contact you when they've carried out the tasks in the plan. Continue to assess suicide risk: Assess and monitor your client's risk of suicide on an ongoing basis. Things can improve or deteriorate rapidly. Return to discussions of means reduction as needed. Adapt plan Make any necessary changes to the plan if the client's situation changes. For instance, if a client moves out of their current home and in with a friend, the plan would need to be updated for the new living situation, and the friend would need to be collaboratively engaged in the plan. Encourage close supervision Encourage family, relatives, and friends to provide closer supervision since clients may struggle with their moods or have episodes of suicidal thoughts interspersed with stretches of feeling okay. Key Points: Collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means and enlist the support of family and friends. Agree on roles and timetable.\nDocument the plan in your notes and monitor progress. Continue to monitor the client's suicide risk as treatment continues. Update the plan to reduce means, as needed.

We really appreciate that.\" Validates and shows you’ve heard the client\nMirror back what you’re hearing is going on • Allow further explanation of the concern by not inserting your opinion\nListen for feelings, themes, motivations, unmet need “It sounds like you’ve had a really tough time.”\n“You’re really angry about what’s happened.” “You’re ____.” Insert any emotion—“mad,” “upset,” “frustrated,” “worried,” etc. You can’t do it wrong! “Sounds like…”\n“Seems like…”\n“It feels like…”\n“To you, it looks like…”\n“I am hearing…”\n“I am wondering if…” Help transition the client to resolution: “So you’ve been through a lot and you’re really upset about everything that’s happened before. It sounds like we need to get you in to talk to someone. Would it be okay to get you scheduled for an appointment?”\n“The last time you were here, you thought you got the run around and didn’t have time to see the provider.

for Working with High Conflict Couples","icon":"","description":"\nWhy are couples behaving so badly? \"The average couple waits 6 years before seeking out therapy.\" (Gottman) In those 6 years there is: Build up of resentments\nReinforced bad habits\nNo boundary enforcement\nErosion of positive perspective\nUnconscious bias kicks - assumptions about purposeful poor behavior choices\nMissed bids for attention\nDepletion of emotional bank account\nNever had any positive role models to begin with From a survey conducted in September 2020: Increases in substance misuse: Alcohol (88%)\nMarijuana (37%)\nPrescription Opioids (15%) Domestic violence cases increased by 25%-33% globally. How are these influences showing up in the clients in the therapy room? Passive/aggressive behaviors\nShut down/Withdrawn/Stonewalling\nWithholding Sex or Avoiding Intimacy\nNarcissistic Behavior Responses\nGaslighting\nAnger\nHigh Conflict\nBoundary Crossing\nPersistent and Ongoing Flooding\nUnwilling to Repair/Apologize/Take Responsibility How to prepare yourself for the unexpected: When you open your office door, look for body language and non-verbals. Have confidence and KNOW that you are the expert in the room. Own it and be brave. Set the tone at the beginning of the session when you feel something is off. Let the clients know what you feel when you feel it, and be willing to talk about what is happening. (Do not wait for clients to bring it up or ignore it)\nModel for your couples that you are going to talk about it, not let things be passive-aggressive or avoid dealing with hot topics. Remind clients who escalate that they are not in therapy to repeat old patterns. Pause and interrupt when you see unacknowledged emotion happening in the room. That is your job. Don't let your couples argue or verbally explode on each other. They can do that at home for free. Take Control. Develop your phrase to create stop-action with clients. Say things like, 'pause, stop,' or call out your client's name, etc. Be direct. What is acceptable and what is not acceptable about words or behavior in the room. What you would like your clients to do instead (as for their positive need). Why it's not okay for them to say or do the thing that you witnessed in the room. Let the clients know how painful it is for you to witness, so you can't imagine what it's like for their partner. Keep your eyes on each client in the room. Are you letting one partner high jack the session? Stop the speaking partner and ask, 'What's coming up for you?' Notice if the other partner checks in. Be mindful of the need to stop and tend to the party not speaking. This is how you keep explosions from getting out of control because you have been checking in on what is happening on the other side of the couch. Step in for clients when they don't have words and find a way to speak their pain to their partner. Keep it fair, so both partners feel you are connected with their pain, needs, and wanted outcomes. Normalize high emotion and disappointment of partner not being able to acknowledge perspectives not because they don't love you. Differences on family of origin, difference in expectations, etc. Prior traumas and life experiences make it hard for partners to always regulate their emotions in ways they would hope. Untreated mental health issues impact ability to manage emotions. Not finished working on the 'Me' stuff versus the 'We' stuff and bleeding over into our relationship. Discuss the impact of substances and the impact it has on being able to manage emotions. Gottman Method: Flooding is expected because partners are experiencing physiological arousal. Utilize pulse oximeters to help validate their elevated heart rate. Be okay with breaking it up. Sometimes you need to have one couple leave the room while you do some one-on-one with the other partner. Let an explosive partner leave if they want. Don't chase them or try to convince them to stay or come back. Talk about the flooding in the room and share ways to help self-regulate, like taking deep breaths or pausing to find ways to reframe. You need to be prepared when working with couples that you might need to a break from couples therapy or stop all together based on how the clients present. This is your call as a therapist to evaluate if working with the couple is contraindicated because of co-occurring mental health, substance, unresolved trauma, suicidal ideation, personality disorders, characterological DV, or anger management issues. Often necessary to request that clients seek out individual therapy to strengthen their individual coping skills before attempting additional couples' therapy. Expect your clients to disagree and give you pushback. Attitude is everything in this conversation. Remember, your clients are not your peers, and we often have to make unpopular decisions about the course of care. When you feel anxious and flooded as the therapist: Notice where you are breathing. Plant both feet on the floor. Take your shoulders back against your chair, take a deep breath into your belly, and repeat to yourself: \"This is not my pain to feel.\" Get in touch with your client's inner 5-year-old old in the room. What is hurting them, and what is the catastrophe scenario that is playing out for them?\nWhen I de-escalate, so do my clients. When my voice gets softer and quieter, so does my clients, and they can often match my tone and calm demeanor. Don't shy away from acknowledging they have the right to feel upset, and it makes sense they would be even if their partner does not agree. Ask their partner to find something they said that they can validate for their partner. Remind them this is not the same as agreeing. Focus on the behavior or the words you heard. We can help facilitate meaningful conversation about the emotions each partner is feeling. Ask the partner who is feeling a big emotion related to their partner to name their emotion. Then talk the behavior they say their partner do or the words they heard them say. Remind and monitor clients to avoid telling their partner their evaluation of why their partner did it or the mind set they were in when it happened. This often happens and only creates defensiveness in their partner. No one likes to be told how they feel. Ask for your positive need. Even if the answer is no - you need to hear yourself asking for your need. Gottman Method Stress Reducing Conversation 10-minutes each partner. Listening for understanding and share emotion. (Not problem-solving)\nHow do clients know it's working? Does your partner feel hear and understood? Then yes. Use of open-ended questions to help partners attune, connect, and provide empathy and support. Questions that allow for each partner to draw out their partner's experience, such as: \"What is this like for you? What do you need? What don't you like about this situation?\" Gottman Method Dreams within Conflict Asks clients to suspend problem-solving so they can have a better understanding of the childhood stories, values, or core ethics and beliefs that keep their partner rooted in their perspective. Clients take turns asking each partner a set of questions so they can better experience what it's like to walk in their partner's shoes. Preparation for compromise like partners who love each other. Gottman Method Injuries Exercise Helps partners find a structured and safe format to talk about old injuries in a way that helps facilitate compassion, acceptance, and understand about prior and shared traumas.\nCreates awareness and insight about the impact and ways these traumas have shaped the way each partner views their world.\nHelps evaluate how clients have learned to cope and survive. Can help some clients gain insight on how they behave in relationships in ways that no longer serve them.\nHelps couples therapist normalize and make recommendations of ways those old injuries get triggered in the relationship and behavior changes that might be beneficial. Gottman Method Appreciations Exercise Changes tone and energy in session.\nAllows each partner to find something positive to notice about their partner to demonstrate holding each other from a positive perspective.\nMakes deposits into each partner’s emotional bank account.\nStarts conversations about how to do small things often in the relationship for highly disconnected couples.\nWay to end session, so couples can ground before leaving in turmoil. If apologies are made, they are often expressed as implying you misunderstood something but without remorse for poor behaviors\nOutside behaviors or the other person is ALWAYS the source of conflict or turn it around on the other person implying they are really the culprit for the issue\nSelf-doubt creeps in and the partner being gaslit internalizes their lack of hard work in the relationship as the cause of all the problems.\nGuilt develops about bringing up issues in the relationship.\nIt feels very much like the result of narcissistic behavior responses.\nThe partner who is doing the gaslighting may do so unconsciously to gain control or power in the relationship when they feel out of resources or support.\nManipulation that involves making someone question their own reality, feelings, and experiences of events, in order to maintain CONTROL over that person. Deflecting the other person by use of lack of acknowledgement, negative body language, and minimizing statements about the other person’s perspective or feelings. Unwillingness to accept any part of the responsibility for a misunderstanding or conflict. Intentional implication that the other person is over-reacting or has fabricated a situation in order to create doubt or challenge the other person’s reality Being cut off from making points, asking questions, or providing input during a disagreement. No acknowledgment of your hurt feelings when expressed. Lacks Empathy.\nClients are often overly invested in using narcissist label with each other. Only 5% of population are diagnosable with narcissistic personality disorder\nYou should be aware that most clients who have diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder are not going to be served in couples therapy and may be contra-indicated. Gottman Interventions to Bring into Session Introduces the idea that anything our partner does for us is a gift - they are not required to do so because we are in a relationship with each other.\nSoftened Start Up: This is helpful for the narcissistic leaning partner to learn how to be clear in their needs and learn how to share why it is important to them. This helps them to slowly understand they are not entitled to anything. Appreciations: Help the narcissistic partner to think about what the other person adds to their life and to acknowledge it. Accept the things you can't change. Helpful for both partners to understand there are some things that are unlikely to ever completely be different in their dynamics. Helps partners make a choice about the relationship from that space of acceptance. Aftermath of a Regrettable Incident: Introduction to Narcissistic person about their role in feeling disrespected or unappreciated. Active listening exercises like the Gottman-Rapport You must interrupt patterns of rage, repeated interruptions, storming off, or screaming. Be on the lookout for a partner who has NPD to be overly charming or makes big declarations of victimhood, or says their only goal is “to fight for the relationship.” Avoid becoming a victim of triangulation or becoming caught up in buying into the hope that you can fix the narcissistic behaviors. You MUST be comfortable being direct, holding a strong position of authority in the room, and be willing to call out poor behavior that is impacting the relationship. Strongly suggest and sometimes require that both partners be in individual therapy and check in with this therapist to make sure they are aware of the dynamics happening in the relationship. The only goal you may accomplish is validating the victim that they are correct in their reality and that they can trust their intuition. You may serve as the objective voice this person needs to get clear and end the relationship. Don’t fight, argue, or try to overpower the narcissist.\nThere is a very strong likelihood that despite your support that these sessions may not go as you hope! Many clients who have narcissistic behaviors can and will use the tools they learn in session to abuse, further manipulate, or weaponize against their partner. True NPD will NOT be ok with the change in or loss of power and will retaliate. Evaluate if the partner is becoming more agitated, aggressive, and if you suspect there is an increased likelihood for physical abuse-stop sessions. Recognize you can and potentially should take a break from therapy with the couples. Should you refer them to seek individual therapy for a while and then re-evaluate if they are good candidates for couples therapy? Couples therapy can re-traumatize the partner who is being victimized. Consider if this is in the scope of your practice? Do you need to refer out? Make time before letting clients go to let them know that it was a hard session and how important it was to have it. Let your partner know that if they are flooded when they will come back and talk about it with you. Make a date with each other to come back and process. Check in with each partner about what they will do to self-soothe. Remind clients that emotions and feeling hurt or misunderstood happens in relationships. The couple is not in this situation because they don’t love each other but because the stakes are so high. This is your person and if we are not ok then nothing feels ok. Let them know you are proud of them for doing the work.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Preparation:","level":2,"id":"Preparation_0"},{"heading":"Intention:","level":2,"id":"Intention_0"},{"heading":"Boundaries when Couples Escalate","level":2,"id":"Boundaries_when_Couples_Escalate_0"},{"heading":"Understanding Each Partner","level":2,"id":"Understanding_Each_Partner_0"},{"heading":"Using Theory to Psychoeducate Couples","level":2,"id":"Using_Theory_to_Psychoeducate_Couples_0"},{"heading":"Diffuse","level":2,"id":"Diffuse_0"},{"heading":"Evaluate if the Couple is Ready for Therapy","level":2,"id":"Evaluate_if_the_Couple_is_Ready_for_Therapy_0"},{"heading":"Self-Check-In","level":2,"id":"Self-Check-In_0"},{"heading":"Be Curious vs. Furious","level":2,"id":"Be_Curious_vs._Furious_0"},{"heading":"HELPFUL Interventions in Session and Beyond","level":2,"id":"HELPFUL_Interventions_in_Session_and_Beyond_0"},{"heading":"Gaslighting (Impacts and Behaviors)","level":2,"id":"Gaslighting_(Impacts_and_Behaviors)_0"},{"heading":"Behaviors","level":3,"id":"Behaviors_0"},{"heading":"Interventions to Work with Narcissistic 'Behaviors'","level":2,"id":"Interventions_to_Work_with_Narcissistic_'Behaviors'_0"},{"heading":"Best Ways to Carry Yourself in Session with Narcissistic Personality Disorder Clients","level":2,"id":"Best_Ways_to_Carry_Yourself_in_Session_with_Narcissistic_Personality_Disorder_Clients_0"},{"heading":"Take Time at End of Session to Reframe What Happened","level":2,"id":"Take_Time_at_End_of_Session_to_Reframe_What_Happened_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/training/strategies-for-working-with-high-conflict-couples.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1707247704840,"modifiedTime":1742962379449,"sourceSize":14678,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Training/Strategies for Working with High Conflict Couples.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/training/strategies-for-working-with-high-conflict-couples.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/ecr-sf-scoring.html":{"title":"ECR-SF Scoring","icon":"","description":"\nResults consist of two scores for the two separate factors; Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.

During pre-sessioning you should decide on the following: The intention or goals for the session\nAgreement on a theoretical model\nCreate a session specific game plan\nDiscuss previous sessions, hypotheses, and evaluation of progress\nMake decisions about next steps in treatment You should also consider the following questions amongst yourself: What would blow you out of the water?\nWhat would be so shocking that you wouldn't know what to do?\nLet's brainstorm what we would do if XYZ occurred in session Examples (arguing, escalation, high conflict, desire to end relationship, risk, etc.) How would you manage that?\nWhat do you anticipate?\nWhat is your theory of what's going on--your theory of the problem? Strategies for the therapy room As a co-therapy team you should determine which strategies you are going to use in the room. What is the role of each therapist and how will you work together. Some strategies to consider: Tag team One starts speaking, while the other would be writing questions, and perhaps nodding occasionally, or making validating and summarizing statements.\nThen, when number one (i.e. the one who was speaking) runs out number two is ready. They're ready, because they've been writing questions, and they can jump in with those questions. Preparation and sharing airtime Who will do what in the session? Who is handling assessment or genogram?\nWill we ever spend time one on one or break up subsystems of the client system?\nSplit the joining tasks\nBefore you go into the room, you decide which member of the couple each therapist will focus on with joining. For example: You're going to join with the husband, and I'm going to join with the wife.\nIt's very specific who we're each validating, empathizing, and summarizing. If you start asking questions of the husband, it's my job to ask the follow-up questions of the wife. In the same vein with the wife, so that we're like two advocates. Reflecting Team As co-therapists there may be times when you find it appropriate to turn to one another and talk about what is going on or what you notice in the room. This could be used as an intervention or to help determine the next steps in the session.\nExample: Co-therapists turn to one another and debate or argue about what is happening with the client system. Have a discussion or debate about what is going on, and then turn back to the couple and say, \"Where are we going wrong?, or \"How are we getting it right?\" ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Pre-Sessioning","level":2,"id":"Pre-Sessioning_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1710692239441,"modifiedTime":1742962384026,"sourceSize":2735,"sourcePath":"Clinic Resources/Preparing for Co-Therapy.md","exportPath":"clinic-resources/preparing-for-co-therapy.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"clinic-resources/questions-for-clients.html":{"title":"Questions for Clients","icon":"","description":"\nQuestions for both: What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?\nCan you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?\nWhat role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?\nCan you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy? Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first): Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. (Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)\nAsk them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement. Now work with the leaning-in partner: Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. Summary statement: Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?\nWhat do you think the problem is now?\nHow will you know when the problem is solved?\nHow will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?\nWhat will have to be different about others involved in the situation?\nWhat is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?\nWhat needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?\nOften in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today? So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?\nWhat is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?\nWhat would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back? Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen? What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?\nWhat changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? How have you managed to cope, ensure, keep going? What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope?

The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n = 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difﬁculties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These ﬁndings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.\nKeywords: Need to Read\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Protective Factors for Adverse Childhood Experiences: The Role of Emotion Regulation and Attachment","level":1,"id":"Protective_Factors_for_Adverse_Childhood_Experiences_The_Role_of_Emotion_Regulation_and_Attachment_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/research-citations/articles/@tannerprotectivefactorsadverse2025.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1738160785101,"modifiedTime":1738160919976,"sourceSize":2245,"sourcePath":"Research Citations/Articles/@tannerProtectiveFactorsAdverse2025.md","exportPath":"research-citations/articles/@tannerprotectivefactorsadverse2025.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"research-citations/books/@gehartmasteringcompetenciesfamily2017.html":{"title":"@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017","icon":"","description":"Bibliography: Gehart, D.

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href=\"Mental Research Institute (MRI)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href=\"Paul Watzlawick\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href=\"Richard Fisch\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt=\"Blamer Stance Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nTherapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.\nWith these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt=\"Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nWhen working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt=\"Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nA client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href=\"Virginia Satir\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href=\"Cybernetics\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href=\"Second-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href=\"Status Quo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href=\"Foreign Element\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href=\"Chaos\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href=\"Status Quo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. <br><a data-href=\"Integration of New Possibilities\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Integration of New Possibilities</a> Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?\nIs each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).\nAll people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).\nEvery person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)\nTherapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness\n<br>Accurate <a data-href=\"Empathy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empathy</a>\nUnconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href=\"Self-Mandala\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind\nBody\nSpirit\nOpen body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact\nTouching clients (e.g., shaking hands)\nSitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)\nAsking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href=\"Empathy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.\nComments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., \"It sounds as though you felt betrayed\") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href=\"Role of the Symptom\"

class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mind-Body Connection</a> Satir viewed the symptom as having a role in the family system. Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles include: <br><a data-href=\"Martyr\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Martyr</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Victim or Helpless One\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Victim or Helpless One</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Rescuer\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rescuer</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Good Child or Parent\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Good Child or Parent</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Bad Child or Parent\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bad Child or Parent</a> The family life chronology is a timeline that includes the major events in an individual's or family's life. Births and deaths\nImportant family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)\nImportant historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns) This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child? Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.\nAt any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. The six layers of the iceberg: Behavior The behavior on the surface; the external manifestations of the person's inner world.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. <br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href=\"Self-Compassion\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.' The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions. The mind-body connection considers how emotional issues may manifest in the body, either symbolically or functionally.

This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relational, family, or systemic goals\nIndividual goals The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication: The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.' What do I HEAR and SEE? The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. <br>This is similar to ' <a data-href=\"videotalk\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href=\"Solution-Focused Therapy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see? After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. Meanings often connect back to past experiences. What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make? The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: \"I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural.\"; incongruent: \"I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.\")\nSubsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. What DEFENSES do I use? <br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href=\"Communication Stances\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Communication Stances</a>. What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use? Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'\nMost of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques' What is my RESPONSE in the situation? How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?\nIncongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change. Satir therapists work with clients to help them express difficult-to-articulate emotions related to the presenting problem. If the clients complain about family members or a difficult life situation, experiential therapists listen closely for the emotions, expressed or unexpressed, that are related to the problem circumstance. They listen not just for the surface emotions, but also for deeper levels of emotion and use questions and empathetic reflections to focus clients on those deeper emotions. If a client tells a story without identifying their emotions directly: \"As I listen to you explain what happened to you during that argument, I am getting a sense that you were feeling [name the emotion]. Does that sound right?\"\n\"That sounds like a very difficult situation. Can you share some of the emotions you have been expeirencing as you go through this?\" If a client does identify emotions, the therapy can help explore them with questions such as: \"You say you were feeling [emotion]. I am wondering if part of you is also feeling [name another emotion that client seems to be experiencing].\"\n\"Can you say more about what feeling [name emotion] feels like for you.\" Satir coached families in softening rigid family rules by changing them to guidelines. For example, rather than saying \"I should not get angry,\" a client or family was encouraged to revise the limiting rule to \"What I am angry, I will express my anger in a way that is respectful to others and myself.\" Satir encouraged families to have as few rules as possible and to be flexible, adapting them for each context and as children's developmental needs change. <br>Coaching clients in how to have authentic, congruent communication in session, involves the ' <a data-href=\"Ingredients of an Interaction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' combined with specific communication coaching strategies. When coaching communication, Satir had clients turn their chairs toward one another and gave the clients prompts, such as, \"Tell your partner how you feel about what happened on Saturday night.\" If the client was able to congruently address their partner about this, Satir then prompted the partner to respond in kind, continuing this process until the problem was resolved. When a person had trouble communicating congruently and reverted to a survival stance, Satir interrupted the conversation and suggested how to rephrase the statement or how to make the client's nonverbal communication more congruent (e.g., \"Now, can you say that starting the statement with 'I' instead of 'you'?\" or \"Can you show me the emotion you say you are feeling when you speak to your wife?\")\n<br>The ' <a data-href=\"Ingredients of an Interaction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' technique was used to help coach clients through what they heard and saw, how they interpreted and felt about it, and the feelings about feelings and family-of-origin rules for communicating about what happened. <br>Family <a data-href=\"Sculpting\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sculpting</a>, which is done either with the family or in a group setting. Sculpting involves putting family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family. Either the therapist or the client may direct the sculpting. If family members are directing the sculpting, each person in the family is given the opportunity to sculpt the family as they see it. Sometimes the sculptor assigns each family member to say a line that represents how they may be feeling, thinking, or viewing the situation. Usually, however, the essence of this intervention is to give a nonverbal, symbolic depiction of the family process from each person's perspective. Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses. Through the sculpting process, a person is able to literally see how they are contributing to the problematic family process far more quickly than when the same information is provided with words. When all family members are sculpting, it is generally best to let all family members sculpt how they see the family before allowing discussion of one another's sculpting. Therapists encourage family members to respect each person's subjective experience as illustrated in the sculpting and to use the experience to deepen their understanding of one another. Satir used touch in therapy to initially connect with clients and to encourage and reassure them when they were practicing new ways of communicating. In this way, she underscored emotional context and provided palpable support. She also used touch with children to help teach alternatives to violent behavior and to model for parents how to manage difficult children. In today's practicing environments, touching is generally discouraged because it can easily be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or may make a client feel uncomfortable. Therapists need to carefully consider the legal and ethical issues of using touch. Touch may be appropriate in certain practice and cultural contexts. At minimum, therapists can learn from Satir the importance of coaching clients in touching each other - their children and spouses - in more loving and helpful ways. For example, rather than using a demonstration, therapists can guide a parent on how to hold children who are having a tantrum. <br>A form of psychodrama, the <a data-href=\"Family Reconstruction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Reconstruction</a> is used to allow clients to explore unresolved family issues and life events in the safety of the group setting. <br>The client, who is called the ' <a data-href=\"Star\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Star</a> ,' first identifies key events in their life chronology and significant sources of influence.

The Undeclared War: We came to think of asylums as places of cruelty and detention, they were originally built to rescue the insane from being locked away in family attics.\nTherapists began to notice that often when a patient got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member.\nPatients often improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home.\nParents use their children as a buffer to protect them from intimacy. Small Group Dynamics: Group dynamics were applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group.\nThe Group Mind (1920) (McDougall) A group’s continuity depends on boundaries for differentiation of function and on customs and habits to make relationships predictable. <br>Field theory by <a data-href=\"Kurt Lewin\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/kurt-lewin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kurt Lewin</a>. He developed the notion that a group is more than the sum of its parts. Quasi-stationary social equilibrium: changing group behavior requires ‘unfreezing.’ Only after something shakes up group’s beliefs will its members be prepared to change. In individual therapy this process is initiated by the unhappy experiences that lead people to seek help.\nMore effort is required to unfreeze, or shake up, families before real change can take place. The need for unfreezing foreshadowed early family therapists’ concern about disrupting family homeostasis.\n<br><a data-href=\"Wilfred Bion (1948)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/wilfred-bion-(1948).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wilfred Bion (1948)</a>:\nFight-flight, dependency, and pairing: Some families skirt around hot issues like a cat circling a snake. Others use therapy to bicker endlessly, never really contemplating compromise, much less change.\nDependency masquerades as therapy when families allow therapists to subvert their autonomy in the name of problem solving.\nPairing is seen in families when one parent colludes with the children to undermine the other parent. Process/Content: Experienced therapists learn to attend as much to how people talk as to the content of their discussions. <br><a data-href=\"Role Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/role-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Role Theory</a>: the expectations that roles carry bring regularity to complex social situations.

Eventually parents of misbehaving children may become polarized into complementary roles of strictness and leniency. What makes such reciprocity resistant to change is that the roles reinforce each other.\nGroup and family therapy are similar: Both are complex and dynamic, more like everyday life than individual therapy. In groups and families, patients must react to a number of people, not just a therapist, and therapeutic use of this interaction is the definitive mechanism of change in both contexts.\nIt turns out that the differences between families and groups are so significant that the group therapy model has only limited applicability to family treatment. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy very different from group therapy.\nThis feeling of safety among sympathetic strangers cannot be part of family therapy because instead of separating treatment from a stressful environment, the stressful environment is brought into the consulting room. <br><a data-href=\"The Child Guidance Movement\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Child Guidance Movement</a>: It was Freud who introduced the idea that psychological disorders were the result of unsolved problems of childhood.

Without this restriction the victim won't feel bound. Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer necessary once the victim is conditioned to perceive the world in terms of double binds; any part of the sequence becomes sufficient to trigger panic or rage. Most examples of double binds in literature are inadequate because they do not include all the critical features. An example of a double bind would be a teacher who urges his students to participate in class but gets impatient if one of them actually interrupts with a question or comment. A schizophrenic has to deal with them continually - and the effect is maddening. Unable to comment on the dilemma, the schizophrenic responds defensively, perhaps by being concrete and literal, perhaps by speaking in metaphors. Eventually, the schizophrenic may come to assume that behind every statement lies a concealed meaning. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families cause schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for the tragedy of their children's psychoses. <br><a data-href=\"Theodore Lidz\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/theodore-lidz.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Theodore Lidz</a>: Lidz refuted the notion that maternal rejection was the distinguishing feature of schizophrenic families.

Positive feedback can have desirable or undesirable consequences. If left unchecked, the reinforcing effects of positive feedback tend to compound a system's errors, leading to a runaway process. Malignant worry, phobic avoidance, and other forms of neurotic behavior may start out with a relatively trivial concern and escalate into an out-of-control process. Example: a panic attack may start out as a relatively harmless instance of being out of breath, but a panicky response to breathlessness may spiral into a terrifying experience. Feedback loops indicate a basic circularity where each element has an effect on the next, until the last element 'feeds back' the cumulative effect into the first part of the cycle. Thus A affects B, which in turn affects C, which feeds back to A, and so on. To survive and adapt to the world around them, all communication systems - including families - need a balance of negative and positive feedback. The cybernetic system turned out to be a useful metaphor for describing how families maintain stability. Cybernetics was the brainchild of MIT mathematician Norbert Weiner (1948). During WWII, Weiner was asked to design a better way to control the targeting of antiaircraft artillery. Weiner's solution was to incorporate a system of internal feedback that enabled antiaircraft guns to regulare their own operations. The signal used to control the artillery was a self-regulating servomechanism - the technical term for the first automated machines.\nHe distinguish two modes of information, discrete or continuous - digital or analog.\nNew technical methods <br><a data-href=\"Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/systems-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Systems Theory</a>:\n<br><a data-href=\"General Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">General Systems Theory</a>:\n<br><a data-href=\"Social Constructivism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Constructivism</a>: Constructivism:\nThe Social Construction of Reality: Attachment Theory:\nThe Working Concepts of Family Therapy: Interpersonal Context: Complementarity Circular Causality:\nTriangles:\nProcess/Content:\nFamily Structure:\nFamily Life Cycle:\nFamily Narratives:\nGender:\nCulture: <br><a data-href=\"Boundaries\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundaries</a>: Emotional and physical barriers that protect and enhance the integrity of individuals, subsystems, and families\n<br><a data-href=\"Family Life Cycle\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/family-life-cycle.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Life Cycle</a>: Stages of family life from separation from parents to marriage, having children, growing older, retirement, and finally death.\n<br><a data-href=\"Genogram\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Genogram</a>: A schematic diagram of the family system, using squares to represent men, circles to indicate women, horizontal lines for marriages, and vertical lines to indicate children.\n<br><a data-href=\"Managed Care\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/managed-care.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Managed Care</a>: A system in which third-party companies manage insurance costs by regulating the terms of treatment.

The strategic approach introduced two of the most powerful insights in family therapy: Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions.\nDirectives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. <br>Strategic therapy grew out of the <a data-href=\"Communications Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/communications-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Communications Theory</a> developed at the Bateson's schizophrenia project, which evolved into three distinct models: the MRI brief therapy, Haley and Madane's strategic therapy, and the Milan systemic model. <br>The birthplace of all three was the Mental Research Institute (MRI), where strategic therapy was inspired by <a data-href=\"Gregory Bateson\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/gregory-bateson.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gregory Bateson</a> and <a data-href=\"Milton Erikson\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/milton-erikson.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Milton Erikson</a>, the anthropologist and the alienist. <br>In 1952, funded by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study paradox in communication, Bateson invited <a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href=\"John Weakland\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/john-weakland.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">John Weakland</a>, and <a data-href=\"Don Jackson\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Don Jackson</a> to join him in Palo Alto.

In 1967 Haley joined Salvador Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.\nIn 1976 Haley moved to Washington DC with Cloe Madanes he founded the Family Therapy Institute. Madanes currently works with motivational speaker and life coach Anthony Robbins. In 1955 Haley moved back to California. He dies in 2007. Jame Keim in California, who developed an innovative way of working with oppositional children, is ably carrying on the Haley-Madanes tradition. Other prominent practitioners of this model include Neil Schiffin Washington DC; Scott Sells at the Savannah Family Institute; and Jerome Price in Michigan. The MRI model had a major impact on the Milan Associates, Mara Selvini Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo, Gianfranco Cecchin, and Guiliana Prata. The Milan Associates eventually split, with Palazzoli and Prata focusing on invariant prescriptions and eventually incorporating more psycho analytic concepts into their work, and Boscolo and Cecchin focusing on circular questioning. Both groups currently have training centers in Italy. Giorgio Nardone is another prominent Italian family therapist who trained at the MRI. In Pragmatics of Human Communication Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson sought to develop a calculus of human communication, which they stated in a series of axioms. People are always communicating. Since all behavior is communicative and since one cannot not behave, then it follows that one cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. The report (or content) of a message conveys information, while the command is a statement about the relationship. <br><a data-href=\"Family Rules\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Rules</a>: <br>In families, command messages are patterned as <a data-href=\"Family Rules\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Rules</a>, which can be deduced from repeated patterns of interaction. <br>Jackson used the term <a data-href=\"Family Rules\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Rules</a> as a description of regularity, not regulation.

Homeostatic mechanisms bring families back to equilibrium in the fae of disruption and thus serve to resist change. <br>Jackson's notion of family homeostasis describes the conservative aspect of family systems and is similar to the cybernetic concept of <a data-href=\"Negative Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Negative Feedback</a>. According to the communication analysis, families operate as goal-directed, rule-governed systems. Communications theorists didn’t look for underlying motives; instead, they assumed circular causality and analyzed patterns of communications linked together in chains of stimulus and response as feedback loops. When the response to a family member’s problematic behavior exacerbates the problem, that chain is seen as a positive feedback loop.\nThe advantage of this formulation is that it focuses on interactions that perpetuate problems, which can be changed, instead of inferring underlying causes, which are often not subject to change. <br><a data-href=\"Negative Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Negative Feedback</a>: Strategic therapists made the concept of the positive feedback loop the centerpieve of the model. For the MRI group, this translated into a simple yet powerful principle of problem formation: Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how family members respond to it. Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This only produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, and so on - in a vicious cycle. <br>The family system is reacting to a deviation in the behavior of one of its members within feedback designed to dampen that deviation (<a data-href=\"Negative Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Negative Feedback</a>), but has the effect of amplifying the deviation (<a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a>).

Jay Haley added a functionalist emphasis to the cybernetic interpretation with his interest in the interpersonal payoff of behavior. Later, he incorporated structural concepts developed during the years he spent with Minuchin. <br><a data-href=\"Hierarchical Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchical-structure.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hierarchical Structure</a>: Haley believed that the rules around the hierarchical structure of a family are crucial and found inadequate parental hierarchies lurking behind most problems. Haley suggested that 'an individual is more disturbed in direct proportion to the number of malfunctioning hierarchies in which he is embedded.' <br>To counter a problem's payoff, Haley borrowed Erickson's technique of <a data-href=\"Prescribing Ordeals\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/prescribing-ordeals.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prescribing Ordeals</a>, so that the price for keeping a symptom outweighed that of giving it up. Like Haley, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her associates focused on power games in families and on the protective function symptoms served for a family. They explored families' histories over several generations, searching for evidence to confirm their hypotheses about how children's symptoms came to be necessary. These hypotheses often involved elaborate networks of family alliances and coalitions. They frequently concluded that patients developed symptoms to protect one or more family members so as to maintain the delicate network of extended family alliances. Strategic therapists say little more than whatever works is normal and that what makes families malfunction are solutions that don't work. <br>According to <a data-href=\"General Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">General Systems Theory</a>, normal families, like all living systems, depend on two processes: They maintain integrity in the face of environmental challenges through negative feedback. No living system can survive without a coherent structure. Negative feedback resists disruptions Too rigid a structure leaves a system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. That is why normal families also have mechanisms of positive feedback. Positive feedback amplifies innovations to accommodate to changed circumstances. Recognizing that the channel for feedback is communication makes it possible to state the case more plainly: Healthy families are able to adapt because they communicate clearly and are flexible. <br><a data-href=\"Mental Research Institute (MRI)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: Resolutely opposed standards of normality. \"As therapists, we do not regard any particular way of functioning, relating, or living as a problem if the client is not expressing discontent with it.\" By limiting their task to eliminating problems presented to them, they avoided taking any positions regarding how families should behave.

His therapy was designed to help families reorganize into more functional structures, with clear boundaries and generational hierarchy. According to communications theory, the essential function of symptoms is to maintain the homeostatic equilibrium of family systems. Symptomatic families were seen as trapped in dysfunctional, homeostatic patterns of communication. These families cling to their rigid ways and respond to signs of change as negative feedback. Change is treated not as an opportunity for growth but as a threat.

One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families usually seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions. <br>Families are organized in <a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a> with <a data-href=\"Boundaries\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundaries</a> regulating the contact family members have with one another.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure\nSeeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href=\"Accommodation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href=\"Boundary Making\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - \"The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family.\" Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href=\"Cross-Generational Coalition\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href=\"Joining\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. \"Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them.\" Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.\nHelp family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.\nMaps the family's underlying structure.\nIntervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating\nEnactment\nStructural Mapping\nHighlighting and Modifying Interactions\nBoundary Making\nUnbalancing\nChallenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong\nPushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href=\"Intensity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href=\"Coalition\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coalition</a>:\nIntensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href=\"Empathy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href=\"Shaping Competence\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href=\"Complementarity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Virginia Satir <a data-href=\"Virginia Satir\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Virginia Satir</a> and <a data-href=\"Carl Whitaker\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Carl Whitaker</a>\nTwo of the newer models - Johnson's (2004) emotionally focused couples therapy and the internal family systems model - have combined the emotional impact of an experiential focus on the individual with a more sophisticated understanding of family systems.

is presented to us. Interpreting the perceptions of what we see and what we hear allows us to reach conclusion about the world around us. The investigator's interpretation of information and evidence commonly requires answers to many questions that can lead critical of decisions, action, and outcomes, such as: What must be done to protect the life and safety of persons?\nShould force, up to and including deadly force, be used to resolve a situation?\nWho will become the focus or subject of a criminal investigation?\nWhat is the best plan to apprehend the person or persons responsible for a criminal act?\nWill someone be subjected to a search of their person or of their home?\nWill someone be subjected to detention or arrest and questioning for a criminal act?\nWill someone have a criminal charge sworn against them?\nWill someone be subjected to a criminal trial?\nWill someone's liberty as a free person be at-risk?\nWill justice be served?\nWill the community be protected? The investigator must always be ready to explain their thinking and actions to the court. Thinking must illustrate an evidence-based path to forming reasonable ground for beliefs and subsequent action. Thinking must demonstrate consideration of the statutory law and case law relevant to the matter being investigated. Investigation is the collection and analysis of evidence.

The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step foot on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson Library. Only assigned enforcers, members of the Bucket and Dipper club, were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. 1922, the Lantern reported members of Bucket and Dipper would even defend freshmen from being dunked in the lake by those who were not permitted to do so, i.e. non-Bucket Dipper members. \"Bucket and Dipper announces that no promiscuous 'ducking' or 'dipping' is to take place under the auspices of other organizations. Any attempt to haze freshmen in this manner by other organizations will result in Bucket and Dipper's strong-arm squad defending the freshmen.\"\nThe student council rejected alternatives to the dunking in Mirror Lake put forth by faculty members.\n1922 was the last tug-of-war across Mirror Lake. University president said, \"The University is trying to make the lake a place of as much beauty as possible.\" 1926: Freshmen got fed up with dunking into Mirror Lake and planned an event to burn the hats they were forced to wear. A huge fight ensued and police were called to the scene. Sophomore was hospitalized. 1929: \"For all practical purposes, freshmen rules are already a thing of the past. Although several attempts have been made to revive the freshmen taboos, and particularly the cap-wearing tradition, the rules have been virtually non-existent since Bucket and Dipper was shorn of its power to enforce them.\" Mirror Lake Fountain (1931): 1942: Tug-of-war made another appearance for tradition week and stuck around for May week in following years. Ariel View (1947): Mirror Lake (1950s):\nLast known reference of tug-of-war across the lake. In 1955, references to dunking popped back up in a Lantern editorial with the following reasons given for dunking: honorary initiates, fraternity seniors, pinned or engaged couples and any other willing soul. Mirror Lake facing North East (1961): 1964: An engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. 1967: Last reference of Bucket and Dipper initiating members by dunking them in Mirror Lake.
