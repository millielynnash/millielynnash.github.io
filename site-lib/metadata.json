This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Cognition\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Cognition\">#Cognition</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Development\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Development\">#Development</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Emotion\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Emotion\">#Emotion</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Motivation\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Motivation\">#Motivation</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Peers\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Peers\">#Peers</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Prefrontal-Cortex\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Prefrontal-Cortex\">#Prefrontal-Cortex</a> <br><img alt=\"Neurobiological Models of Adolescence.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/neurobiological-models-of-adolescence.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe dual-system based largely on Metcalf &amp; Mischel's (1999) two-system model of willpower.

The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Multiracial\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Multiracial\">#Multiracial</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Biracial\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Biracial\">#Biracial</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Qualitative\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Qualitative\">#Qualitative</a> It was not until 1967 that interracial marriages became legal across the US with the Loving v. Virginia case. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18. There is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families. Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict. <br><a data-href=\"Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)</a> <br><a data-href=\"Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation</a> Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.\nThis model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development. Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.\nMultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status. Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth: Cultural Socialization Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. Racial Identity Socialization Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves. Preparation for Bias Messages Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. Egalitarian Socialization Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same Negative Socialization Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial Exposure to Diversity Messages Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. No Racial-Ethnic Socialization Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews Racial Identity Socialization\nPreparation for Bias Socialization\nColorblind Socialization\nDiversity Appreciation Socialization\nRace-Conscious Socialization\nExposure to Diversity Socialization\nNegative Socialization\nSilent Socialization Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture. Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures. Language Socialization There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group. Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned. \"You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such.\" Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them. Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.\nOne way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go.

In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses.

Discussion includes implications for future research and interventions supporting youth ERI.\nKeywords: Need to Read\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"“So, like, it’s all a mix of one”: Intersecting contexts of adolescents’ ethnic‐racial socialization","level":1,"id":"“So,_like,_it’s_all_a_mix_of_one”_Intersecting_contexts_of_adolescents’_ethnic‐racial_socialization_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@sladekitsallmix2022.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1738791706817,"modifiedTime":1738791706824,"sourceSize":1823,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic–racial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‐seated ethnic–racial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic–racial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic–racial socialization in this decade. Furthermore, although it is clear that family ethnic–racial socialization is a robust predictor of youths' adjustment, the associations between socialization and adjustment must be considered with attention to specific socialization strategies, the confluence of strategies used, and the unique contexts within which families' lives are embedded.\nKeywords: Need to Read\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Ethnic–Racial Socialization in the Family: A Decade's Advance on Precursors and Outcomes","level":1,"id":"Ethnic–Racial_Socialization_in_the_Family_A_Decade's_Advance_on_Precursors_and_Outcomes_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/5.-racial-and-ethnic-identity-development/@umana-taylorethnicracialsocialization2020.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1738791721051,"modifiedTime":1738791721056,"sourceSize":1746,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/5.

Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. Example. An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. Example. An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. Example. A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. Clinical implication Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics.

Long-term impact of adolescence While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. Developmental Systems Model This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. This model emphasizes Change and Relative Plasticity Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development Relationism and Integration Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. Historical Embeddedness and Temporality Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. Implications for Research and Application This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions. 'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes. This knowledge will inform effective policies and interventions to maximize the positive potential of adolescence for individuals and society as a whole.

Family Influences","icon":"","description":"I. OverviewThis document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:\nThe impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.\nParental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.\nThe interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.\nThe importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.\nII. Key Themes and FindingsA. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)\nCore Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.\nKey Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.\n\"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)...\"\nSecrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.\nIncreased secrecy is linked to \"stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret.\"\nImplications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.\nB. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)\nCore Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).\nKey Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (ρ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).\nPsychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.\nParental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. \"Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure.\"\nCultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.\nImplications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.\nC. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)\nCore Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.\nKey Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms\nGreater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.\n\"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship.\"\nRacial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety\nImplications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.\nD. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)\nCore Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.\nKey Findings:\"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.\"\nLGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.\nLatino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents\nImplications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.\nIII. Quotes\nFrijns et al. (2010): \"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)...\"\nLiu et al. (2020): \"Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure.\"\nMontoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): \"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship.\"\nRyan et al. (2010): \"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.\"\nIV. Overall ImplicationsThese studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on strengthening family bonds, addressing both cultural and economic stressors, and promoting positive family dynamics to support healthy adolescent development.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/7.-family-influences.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739654857377,"modifiedTime":1739654889630,"sourceSize":5848,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/7.
