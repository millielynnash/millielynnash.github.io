This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Cognition\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Cognition\">#Cognition</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Development\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Development\">#Development</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Emotion\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Emotion\">#Emotion</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Motivation\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Motivation\">#Motivation</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Peers\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Peers\">#Peers</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Prefrontal-Cortex\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Prefrontal-Cortex\">#Prefrontal-Cortex</a> <br><img alt=\"Neurobiological Models of Adolescence.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/neurobiological-models-of-adolescence.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe dual-system based largely on Metcalf &amp; Mischel's (1999) two-system model of willpower. According to the model, self-control results from a balance between a 'cool' and a 'hot' system. The cool system is an emotionally neutral, strategic, and flexible cognitive system. The hot system is emotionally driven by fears, desires, and reflexes. The balance between these two system varies as a function of the individual, development, and stress. The dual-system model was used to heuristically explain brain systems underlying behavior involving immediate versus delayed rewards.

The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Multiracial\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Multiracial\">#Multiracial</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Biracial\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Biracial\">#Biracial</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Qualitative\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Qualitative\">#Qualitative</a> It was not until 1967 that interracial marriages became legal across the US with the Loving v.

There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families. Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict. <br><a data-href=\"Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Critical Multiracial Theory (MultiCrit)</a> <br><a data-href=\"Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ecological Model of Biethnic Identity Formation</a> Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.\nThis model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development. Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.\nMultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status. Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth: Cultural Socialization Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. Racial Identity Socialization Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves. Preparation for Bias Messages Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. Egalitarian Socialization Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same Negative Socialization Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial Exposure to Diversity Messages Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. No Racial-Ethnic Socialization Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews Racial Identity Socialization\nPreparation for Bias Socialization\nColorblind Socialization\nDiversity Appreciation Socialization\nRace-Conscious Socialization\nExposure to Diversity Socialization\nNegative Socialization\nSilent Socialization Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture. Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures. Language Socialization There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group. Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned. \"You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such.\" Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them. Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.\nOne way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go.

In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses.

Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic–racial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‐seated ethnic–racial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic–racial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic–racial socialization in this decade.

Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. Example. An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. Example. An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. Example. A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. Clinical implication Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics.

Long-term impact of adolescence While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. Developmental Systems Model This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. This model emphasizes Change and Relative Plasticity Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development Relationism and Integration Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. Historical Embeddedness and Temporality Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. Implications for Research and Application This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions. 'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes.

Family Influences","icon":"","description":"I. OverviewThis document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:\nThe impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.\nParental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.\nThe interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.\nThe importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.\nII. Key Themes and FindingsA. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)\nCore Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.\nKey Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.\n\"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)...\"\nSecrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.\nIncreased secrecy is linked to \"stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret.\"\nImplications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.\nB. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)\nCore Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).\nKey Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (ρ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).\nPsychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.\nParental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. \"Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure.\"\nCultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.\nImplications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.\nC. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)\nCore Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.\nKey Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms\nGreater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.\n\"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship.\"\nRacial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety\nImplications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.\nD. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)\nCore Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.\nKey Findings:\"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.\"\nLGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.\nLatino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents\nImplications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.\nIII. Quotes\nFrijns et al. (2010): \"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)...\"\nLiu et al. (2020): \"Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure.\"\nMontoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): \"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship.\"\nRyan et al. (2010): \"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.\"\nIV. Overall ImplicationsThese studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on strengthening family bonds, addressing both cultural and economic stressors, and promoting positive family dynamics to support healthy adolescent development.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/7.-family-influences.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739654857377,"modifiedTime":1739654889630,"sourceSize":5848,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/7.

mission to spark discovery of Ohio’s stories. As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state’s history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;<br>For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://mozartscafe.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mozartscafe.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart’s brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This \"taste of Austria\" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most \"brilliantly illuminated city in the country.\" Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days.

This week we will begin to look at the basic patterns of sexual orientation and behavior. We also look at the critiques on sexual attitudes, sex education, and the sexual double standard. By the end of this module, you will be able to answer some questions such as...\nWhat is sexual orientation? How have attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the medical and scientific communities?\nAccording to researchers, what is the role of genetics, evolution, and social environment in determining sexual orientation?\nREMINDER: Please put aside enough time to watch 'How to Lose Your Virginity' (1 hour and 6 minutes) and 'Sex 101' (20 min).&nbsp;<br>In this week's restaurant, I chose Belle's Bread.&nbsp;Tucked away in the Japanese marketplace located on Kenny Centre Mall,&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/\" target=\"_self\">Belle’s BreadLinks to an external site.</a>&nbsp;is a family-owned and -operated, French-inspired Japanese bakery. Takashi Takenaka opened the business after immigrating from Japan in 1972, and he pays homage to childhood treats with his red bean roll, frank roll, and curry and boiled egg doughnuts. The bear-shaped strawberry cream bun is all over social media, but the best-kept secret is the Mont Blanc roll with its layers of delicate, airy sweet cream and chestnuts.&nbsp;<br>In Columbus Lore this week, our amazing student Doug Motz wrote this piece on the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/\" target=\"_self\">AIU &amp; The LeVeque TowerLinks to an external site.</a>. I learned so much information from this article, and it is just one piece of history from our city. Please take a moment to read through this article, if you get the chance. You know that big building that has those beautiful lights displayed at the top? Yup, that's this place! It has gone through it's fair share of history, and many owners. Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!! Just a wonderful piece of history to share with you all.&nbsp;Go outside and play in the leaves, take a moment to breathe. You have done so well, and I am so proud of you!

This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.<br>In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today’s University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today’s University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976.

I chose Emmett's Cafe! This bakery/cafe is located in the Old North.&nbsp;Inspired by Australian coffee culture, Emmett’s is the top pick for morning hangouts with a flat white or cold brew. This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks. Get that pumpkin spice latte for yourself, you deserve that treat! I can't wait to see the leaves falling all over campus.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn Ash (Lynn Reidinger)Hey Class,I apologize for missing our weekly announcement last week, but I was unfortunately not feeling well. We can't skip this week, what if some of you are waiting on this week's Columbus lore? As always, I will have interesting history, activities, and suggested restaurants below.You worked through your midterm, WOO! I am so proud of each of you for getting to this point in the semester. I can't believe we are almost finished. It has been a pleasure getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to each of you that congratulated me on my marriage, and this week seems very fitting!This week we look at marriage and cohabitation. Be mindful as we reflect on diversity, inequality, and social change in terms of marriage. We will consider how marital quality changes across the life course and illustrate the hallmarks of poor marital communication. Do you know what are the predictors of a high quality, satisfying marriage? What specific relationships come to mind when you think of a healthy marriage?This week's assignments are outlined below. As always, we accept your assignments 24-hours late with a 2-point deduction on your essays and discussions, and a 1-point deduction for your weekly reflections.

The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps “The Five Brothers,” which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.anthony-thomas.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.anthony-thomas.com/\" target=\"_self\">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!<br><img alt=\"Announcements-7.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAnthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony’s dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony’s son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony’s Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father. Realizing&nbsp;the quality of the candy was creating a demand, Tom and his father decided to make it a full time trade, and using their first names they formed the Anthony-Thomas Candy Company in 1952.Astounding Activities: The Scioto Deer&nbsp;“Announcements-8.png” could not be found.You may have probably seen at least one of the three bronze deer sculptures located throughout Columbus, but do you know why they’re actually there? It’s okay, neither did I. These friendly, relaxed-looking deer were added to the Scioto Mile as part of the big rehabilitation project in 2014 that&nbsp;turned the area into the incredible multi-use park and trail space it is now.There are a total of three deer along the Scioto River admiring the river, and they were put in during the renovation. Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don’t worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;I hope you all have a great week. I should be on tomorrow for our office hours if you may need anything (My office hours are Tuesdays from 1p-2p). Please take some time this week to soak in some sun and enjoy this fall weather. You have worked so hard to get to this point!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshIT'S HALLOWEEN!!!This is my favorite holiday, and it makes me so happy to see people dressed up while walking around campus. Make sure to grab some candy for yourself (... getting it on sale tomorrow does in fact count), and take it easy this week.

The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!“Announcements-9.png” could not be found.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html\" target=\"_self\">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a>On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn’s products.Astounding Activities:&nbsp;“Announcements-10.png” could not be found.<br>For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/\" target=\"_self\">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape.

Mr. Ted has been coming to campus with me, so if you ever see us walking by don't be afraid to say hi!Have a fantastic week!Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHi Buckeyes!Though we are not covering anything this week, I wanted to send an announcement out to all of you regarding the event that will take place for each of you tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;Warmest regards,Millie Lynn AshHappy Tuesday everyone!Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life. We discuss examples of implicit bias and microaggressions and how they impact the individual and family.&nbsp;<br>We will be reading Chapter 3 in Cohen (2020) this week, which is posted under the top module labelled '<a title=\"Textbook Information\" class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/courses/180658/modules/1814602\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Textbook Information</a>.'

This can be seen on the Scree plot where there is a point where the slope of the curve changes, which is usually the cutoff for the number of factors we would retain. Factors to the left of the cutoff are considered meaningful. This is why there are only 3 out of the original 12 factors that were extracted from the analysis.

So, if the p-value of the maximum Mahal distance (Check the 'Residual Statistics Table') is greater than the threshold of .001, you can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictor(s).\nYou do not even have to check the Mahal distance for individual cases. The absolute values of DfFITS (i.e., |SDF_1|) tells us the magnitude of the effect an individual case have on the predicted values. This indicates that, the SDF_1, similar to the Cook's distance, help examine the influence of some cases on the predicted values. Cases with absolute values of DfFITS greater than 2 (i.e., |SDF_1| &gt; 2) should be examined. <br><img alt=\"4.

A case with an DfBeta greater than 2 can be said to have greater influence on the regression parameter in question (Pituch &amp; Stevens, 2016). This case then has to be investigated.<br>\n<img alt=\"4.

Model summary includes the R2 value, which in this case shows a significant amount of variance explained (37.63%) Below, in the 'Model' table, you can see the coefficients for the intercept as well as for the slopes of Dose, Love of Puppies, and the automatically created interaction term.

Here, we see that when puppy love is at the 16 th percentile (puppy love = 1), the effect is 1.81 (p = .0013). Likewise, when puppy love is at the 50 th percentile (2.5), the effect is also significant (p = .0046) at 1.1694. However, the effect is no longer significant at the 84 th percentile for puppy love, (p &gt; .05).<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-16.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-16.png\" target=\"_self\"> The next table is the Johnson-Newman results. The Johnson-Newman approach looks for the values of W, where the p-values of the conditional effect changes to above/below the chosen significance level (. 05). So, it looks for the values of W that cause t-crit value to equal zero for when determining the conditional effect of X, where the p-value is exactly the alpha, or .05 in most cases. At what values of W, do the results go from significant to non-significant, or vice-versa, in terms of conditional effect?\nYour results can either be of one, two, or zero values. If there is one value, that means there is only one value of W where the conditional effect either becomes significant or loses significance. If there are two values, that means there are two points at which W will change in significance. This will either mean the middle range is significant, but not the high and low values of W, or that the high and low values of W are significant, but not the middle range. The middle range is determined by the W values themselves. If there are no values, then the conditional effect is either always significant or never significant for all values of W. Next are graphical representations for what different types of Johnson-Newman results may look like. Where the line cross .05, that's where this approach looks for the value of W, giving us more insight into what extent our moderator... Well, moderates.<br>\n<img alt=\"5.

So, it is significant with lower levels of puppy love. (First column, row 3.3364)<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-20.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-20.png\" target=\"_self\"> The moderator (puplove) has significant impact on the relationship between time spent with Puppies and Happiness, only at its low values (i.e., from 0.00 to 3.3364) This implies that, the less an individual loves a puppy, the more time spent with puppy affect (increases) their happiness. At its higher values, the moderator (puplove) does not have a significant effect on the relationship between time spent with Puppies (focal predictor) and Happiness (outcome variable) This implies that, increasing the time spent with Puppy does not affect/change (increases) happiness for individuals who already love Puppies. The next part of the table give us the syntax to generate the plot<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-21.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-21.png\" target=\"_self\">\nDouble click on the matrix table and it will allow you to highlight and copy parts of the text. Highlight and copy from the DATA LIST FREE/ until the period at the end. Once you copy the code, paste it into a new syntax file. There is nothing you need to change. Just highlight and play the syntax. The results will look like the graph below, a plot with points but no lines.<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-22.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-22.png\" target=\"_self\"> To create plot lines, double click on the plot itself. A 'Chart Editor' pop-up will appear.<br>\n<img alt=\"5.

Just close the properties box and the chart editor box.<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-24.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-24.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThis is what your chart should look like now. You can now have lines that can help you to visualize the changes in X vs. Y, given the subgroups of W. Pretend that literature shows that the more someone loves puppies, the happier they are. We would like to test that theory, but with a moderator of time spent with puppies during a trial (dose).\nHere, we are recognizing that Dose is a multi-categorical variable for control group (0 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes with puppies).\nTypically, we would need to dummy-code these variables, but PROCESS does it for you, provided you remember one extra step. First, set up the model as usual in PROCESS. Note. Where the variables are in the image based on the new hypothesis. Next click on 'Multicategorical'<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-25.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-25.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe next pop-up you will get is the multicategorical box. Here, you will select the checkbox under 'Variable W' to indicate that your moderator is multicategorical. Note. The other options, indicating that you can also do this for any X or Z variables(s) that have 3 or more categories. Click Continue.<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-26.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-26.png\" target=\"_self\">\nClick OK. One of the changes is the dummy coding. The coding scheme is provided just below the model overview and will look something like the table below.<br>\n<img alt=\"5. Conditional Process Analysis-27.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/5.-conditional-process-analysis-27.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe next change is the model and product terms key tables. Just keep in mind the W coding scheme from before when interpreting each line, since now we are recognizing the separate levels of our W.\nThe final change is the set-up of the conditional effects table. Usually, this will either be representative of the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentile (default), or the means +/- 1 SD (if selected). However, now since we are recognizing W as a categorical variable, the doses are listed as the separate categories.\n- Note how there is no mention of the percentiles in the 'Analysis Notes and Errors' section.<br>\n<img alt=\"5.

You can run the ANCOVA model by including an interaction term (groups x covariate). The interaction term should not be statistically significant.

They are <a data-href=\"Dependent Observations\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dependent Observations</a> Differences from pre to post (e.g., time 1 to time 2)\nOften the same respondents, repeatedly measured (not always, but not our focus) In comparison, independent-groups designs look at: Differences in means across groups (often manipulated in experimental designs)\nMean differences across existing groups Gender, school level, generation status (e.g., quasi-experimental designs) With repeated measures designs, the structure of the data becomes relevant. Data types Long Respondents have multiple rows of data corresponding to multiple measurement occasions Wide Respondents have one row of data\nMultiple variables are used to represent multiple measurement occasions GLM for repeated measures (aka repeated measures ANOVA/MANOVA) Combination of both between-and within-subjects factors are referred to as 'mixed designs' Different people are assigned to different levels of the factor\nEach case (person) is exposed/included to only one condition or level The same person tests all conditions (i.e., is exposed to all levels of the factor)\nRepeated-measures designs are 'within-subjects' designs, where each subject forms a 'group' or factor Repeated measures ANOVA SST = SS (Explained) + SS (unexplained) We are trying to explain differences in teh repeated measures due to time (or whatever the within factor is)\nWe are removing/controlling variability due specifically to subjects. We need to characterize unexplained/residual variability carefully for repeated measures designs (i.e., through the subject x time interaction)\nOne-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA One-Way Repeated measures ANOVA with A treatments/times and B persons includes three 'sum of squares' terms. <br><img alt=\"7.

Relatedly, homogeneity of covariance is equal variances and covariacnes across time. Sphericity is a tough assumption to meet, as we don't expect correlations between times 1, 3, and 5 to be necessarily the same. Mauchly's sphericity test in SPSS tests this assumption. We do NOT want this to be statistically significant. The distribution of the data will not be in line with an F-distribution\nLoss of statistical power\nPost-hoc tests become uninterpretable\nIf violated, what should we do? Use a more conservative f-test. SPSS gives you three options increasing in conservatism\nConsider using MANOVA\nConsider using multilevel modeling Based on estimates of sphericity (Epsilon; ε) Ranges from 0 - 1 with higher scores meaning greater homogeneity Huynh-Feldt Correction (least conservative) ε &gt; .75\nGreenhouse-Geisser (more conservative) ε &lt; .75\nLower-bound (most conservative) ε &lt;. 75\nIf the results change depending on which correction used, it's a safer bet to use Greenhouse-Geisser regardless of Epsilon value (e.g., the cutoff somehow made a difference) or report both and acknowledge the difference. <br>Instead of time as treatment effect (univariate), MANOVA treats time as separate <a data-href=\"Dependent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dependent Variable</a> s (multivariate)\nRepeated measures analyses automatically include both, but if sphericity is violated, it might be better to just use MANOVA. Repeated Measures ANOVA Univariate DV\nMore rigid assumptions of sphericity\nWhen sphericity holds, use RM ANOVA\nYou can look at contrasts and other post-hoc tests MANOVA Multivariate DVs\nLess rigid assumptions of sphericity\nA large violation of sphericity (ε &lt; .70) and sample sizes of 10 people larger than the number of groups (j + 1), use MANOVA. The power of MANOVA varies as a function of the correlation between the DVs. <br>Multilevel modeling approach (aka <a data-href=\"Hierarchical Linear Models\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/models/hierarchical-linear-models.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hierarchical Linear Models</a>; General Linear Mixed-Effects Models)\nGrowth curve models Predicts individual differences in change over time Time is nested within each subject\nVery flexible Allows for random effects and variability in measurement occasion. If the overall F for differences among treatments is statistically significant, further analysis is needed to evaluate where the significant differences are. The SPSS procedure contrasts that can be used to evaluate differences. If the repeated measure has k levels, a set of contrasts include (k - 1) comparisons\nOptions Polynomial contrasts (the default in SPSS, but rarely used in social sciences)\nRepeated contrasts\nSimple contrasts For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3 This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them. <br>Very similar to dummy coding in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" data-href=\"Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Multiple Regression</a>, where we only know differences between the reference category and all other categories (not each other) Compare the mean of each level (except the last) with the mean of the subsequent level Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 2 &gt; Time 3 Useful if the responses are in a meaningful order (like time)\nEquivalence (or justifiable inequivalence) of measurement is crucial Makes more sense when the levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to different amounts of treatment (rather than different types)\nIf there are k levels for the repeated-measures factor, then (k - 1) polynomials will be tested.

SPSS makes it easy to restructure your data, albeit if certain parameters are in place first There must be an ID variable for every participant\nThere must be an index variable that indicates timepoint for data\nThere must NOT be duplication of a case within a timepoint\nPreferable if all cases have equal timepoints of data (makes things easier to see and is required by most analyses, though not necessarily for data restructure) Data &gt; Restructure &gt; Restructure Data Wizard!\nIgnore the words SPSS uses (they are hard to understand) and instead look at the pictures. Wide to stacked is first, and stacked to wide is second. Ignore the third one (trust me). “7. Repeated Measures Designs-3.png” could not be found. Select your ID variable and put it as the identifier variable and select your timepoint variable and put it as your index variable. Leave everything else as default on all other pages!\n“7.

So, if the global satisfaction scale has seven items that we want combined across time, we need to say seven variables. “7. Repeated Measures Designs-5.png” could not be found.\nSelect your ID variable and put it as the case group identification. You could also 'use case number' and have the ID variable be a fixed variable, but I find that more troublesome. You then have to include all items to be stacked in separate blocks based on what the variable will be. You must do this for every variable to be stacked. The dataset has 129 such variables, so you can see that this will take a long time. Most of the time, stacked data comes stacked so you don't need to do this. “7.

Dependent samples t-test assesses differences, not changes. Change/growth requires three timepoints and often longitudinal modeling is used.

The test scores were compared over time. Thus, we have 3 levels in the within-subjects factor (Time). For each pair of levels, we can obtain a st of difference scores. The sphericity assumption states that these three sets of difference scores have equal variance. If the variance of the difference scores are statistically equal then the sphericity assumption has been met. The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA\nThe violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA. <br>The violation causes the 'Usual' F-test to become too liberal (i.e., an increase in the <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a> rate).

SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also.

Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. <br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality-1.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-1.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.\n<br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality-2.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-2.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIn order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.\nIf you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. <br><img alt=\"Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIf the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.\nThe distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2.

nofollow\">Moderation</a>\nMediation examines how the effect of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) is transmitted through a third variable, called the mediator (M). In simple mediation, there is one mediator. To determine if the IV influences the DV directly and/or indirectly via the mediator. The model splits the total effect into The portion of the effect of IV on DV that is not explained by the mediator. The portion of the effect that is transmitted from IV to DV through the mediator. Relationships among IV, mediator, and DV are linear. Scatterplots: Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot and plot DV vs. IV and DV vs. M. Look for a straight-line pattern. Residuals vs. Predicted Plot: Run Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear…; click Plots… to assign standardized predicted values (X-axis) and standardized residuals (Y-axis).\nCriteria: No systematic pattern (i.e., randomness, with any curve test yielding p &gt; .05). Residuals have constant variance across all levels of predictors. Examine the same residuals vs. predicted plot for an even spread (no funnel shape). Residuals are approximately normally distributed. Create histograms and Q–Q plots using Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram or Q–Q plot options. Criteria: Skewness values less than |2.0| and kurtosis values less than |7.0|; Q–Q plot points should lie near the diagonal line. Observations are independent. Confirm via your study design.\nReview the Durbin–Watson statistic from your regression output (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable). There are no unmeasured variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and DV. This is primarily a design issue; however, consider including control variables if needed. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX by Andrew Hayes\nChoose Model 4 (designed for simple mediation).\nSet the DV, IV, and mediator in the appropriate boxes.\nEnable bootstrapping (commonly set to 5,000 samples) to obtain robust confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effect.\nClick OK. Direct Path (IV → M): Example: a = 0.40, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path from Mediator to DV (M → DV, controlling for IV): Example: b = 0.50, SE = 0.12, p = .002 Indirect Effect (a × b): Example: 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.200.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.20 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.08, 0.35] (does not include zero → significant mediation). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for M):\nExample: c′ = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005\nTotal Effect (IV → DV without mediator):\nExample: c = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001 A mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to examine whether [Mediator] mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The total effect of [IV] on [DV] was significant (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001). When [Mediator] was entered into the model, the direct effect decreased (b = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005). The indirect effect was significant (b = 0.20, SE = 0.07, 95% CI [0.08, 0.35]), indicating that [Mediator] partially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently. To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator(s) play a significant role and to what extent. IV → Mediator 1 → DV IV → Mediator 2 → DV (Mediators do not influence one another) Generate scatterplots for DV vs. each mediator.\nRun separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. predicted plots. Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern. Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression. Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|. Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators. Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy. As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5). Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.\nUse Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.\nEnter the IV, DV, and list all mediators. Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect. Click OK. Example: a1 = 0.30, b1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012). Example: a2 = 0.25, b2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025). Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant). Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001 A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.” Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV. To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. Generate scatterplots and residual vs. predicted plots for each link: IV → M1, M1 → M2, and M2 → DV.\nUse histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression. Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5. There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M1 influences M2). Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M2 on M1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory. Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary. Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.\nChoose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).\nEnter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.\nClick Options: Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals. Click OK. Path IV → Mediator 1: Example: a1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001 Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2: Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001 Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M1):\nExample: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002\nSequential Indirect Effect (IV → M1 → M2 → DV):\nCalculation: a1 × d × b2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473 Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018). Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):\nExample: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001 A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation. Check Assumptions in SPSS: Generate scatterplots, residual vs. predicted plots, histograms, and Q–Q plots.\nVerify diagnostic values: skewness (&lt; |2.0|), kurtosis (&lt; |7.0|), Durbin–Watson (1.5–2.5), and inter-mediator correlations (r &lt; 0.80 for parallel mediation).\nFor serial mediation, confirm intermediate regression steps are significant (p &lt; .05). Conduct Mediation Analysis with PROCESS: Use the appropriate model: Model 4 for simple and parallel mediation; Model 6 for serial mediation.\nEnter variables as specified and enable bootstrapping (commonly 5,000 samples) to generate 95% confidence intervals. Interpret Output: Evaluate p-values for each path (significant if p &lt; .05).\nFor indirect effects, confirm that bootstrapped confidence intervals do not include zero.

In this article, we detail the advantages of using these data sets to study developmental questions across the life span. First, we provide an overview of how using secondary data can increase studies’ scientiﬁc integrity. Then, we detail where and how data sets can be obtained that answer speciﬁc questions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues related to using longitudinal, population data sets. These data sets can enhance science and test theories by increasing the rigor and generalizability of research to the general population, making secondary data analysis an important method to consider.\nKeywords: Need to Read Primary data are collected by an individual or a team of researchers and are often based on the theory or models of the researcher or research team. These data are also generally proprietary and not shared with the larger research community. In contrast, secondary data analysis uses data collected by other researchers or organizations, and the users are generally not part of the design of the study. These data sets (e.g., most national studies) have been collected for the use of the research community or have been made available for other researchers to use (e.g., in data archives). These data sets were collected based on the research theories and models of the primary researchers and include extensive measurements on the areas of interest to the research team. Although some data sets remain proprietary to the original researcher or research team, new regulations on data sharing from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are increasing the amount of data available for secondary data analysis. Many secondary data sets contain similarities in measurement that allow many data sets to be combined using techniques such as integrative data analysis, a technique that is especially useful for data sets that represent highly selective groups (e.g., children of alcoholics) that would be difficult to find in a general population sample. Combining the data sets increases the sample size and thus the power to examine these groups. Using secondary data sets, especially those collected at the population level, increases statistical power and external validity as a result of a larger sample size and greater diversity of respondents (with regard to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). This advantage, combined with reducing the time and money it takes to collect one's own longitudinal data, makes secondary data analysis a good option.\nThese data resources are easy to obtain. In the US, the two largest social science data archives are the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Murray Research Archive.<br>\n<img alt=\"Social Science Secondary Data Archives Table.jpeg\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/social-science-secondary-data-archives-table.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nICPSR requires affiliation with a member institution. Some data sets are available for immediate download while others require an application explaining the scientific purpose for data use. Data are generally free though fees may apply for digitization of not-yet digital materials or other labor-intensive data-preparation tasks. Archives are easily searchable, including the ability to search by study topic or variable name. Searching by study topic is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching by variable name is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching for variable name is helpful when the researcher is interested in a particular variable, such as rates of endorsement or forms of measurement of a variable across studies. Most archives allow researchers to perform basic descriptive analyses online before downloading a data set, including frequency counts for each variable and tabular analysis. Scientists can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in responses, or not too much missing data for the new study. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. The most important step is to read all the data documentation - text documents posted in the data archive alongside the data. Understanding and properly accounting for the sampling frame and necessary weights are crucial in producing accurate results, and the study documentation contains the necessary information. Secondary data rarely have all the measures to answer investigators' questions. Using data that have been collected by others typically means that measures for some of the constructs germane to the research question will be missing. Because population data sets typically measure a broad set of constructs with limited measurement on any given construct, they often are not ideal for answering nuanced questions that require in-depth measurement. Once a researcher has addressed the issue of obtaining the data set or sets to address his or her research questions and whether they adequately answer the relevant research questions, additional statistical issues must be considered in analyzing this data. Because oversampling of one or more subpopulations is common in population-based studies, researchers often must apply a same weight if they want their findings to generalize to the target population. Subpopulations that are underrepresented in the sample relative to the target population have sample weights larger than 1.0, while the opposite holds for subpopulations overrepresented in the sample relative to the target population. When no sample weights are applied, it is as if a sample weight of 1.0 is uniformly applied to all subpopulations. In effect, this assumes all subpopulations are represented accurately within the sample, leading to biased estimates when this assumption does not hold. Typically, the appropriate set of sample weights and its corresponding variable name are identified clearly within a data set's documentation files. <br>In contrast to sample weights, which adjust for <a data-href=\"Sampling Bias\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/sampling-bias.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sampling Bias</a>, attrition weights correct for bias introduced by attrition. The objective of attrition weights is to render the Wave 2 sample comparable to the full Wave 1 sample. Mathematically, attrition weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition or dropping out: P (Wave 1) / (Wave 2) Combination weights (also called longitudinal weights) adjust for both sampling bias and attrition bias. Mathematically, combination weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., the sample weight) multiplied by the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition (i.e., the attrition weight): [P (target population) / P (sample)] x [P (Wave 1) / P (Wave 2)].\nWe suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights (either alone or as a part of combination weights) and instead of using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), or multiple imputation (MI) to adjust for attrition bias and then use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias. We make this recommendation because relative to FIML and MI, attrition weights (including combination weights) have two disadvantages: Unlike FIML and MI, attrition weights often sharply reduce the analytical sample size and, thereby, statistical power. Typically, only those participants with data at every wave are assigned an attrition weight and used in subsequent analyses. This problem is compounded as a study's number of waves (and therefore attrition) increases. Second, if many auxiliary variables (i.e., non-model variables related to missing data) are incorporated, FIML and MI may adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights. Most statistical packages can use FIML, including STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS, and AMOS, and many use MI (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS). Most large-scale data sets were collected using complex sample designs that entail a clustered sampling design (e.g., schools are randomly sampled and then all students within the selected schools are sampled). <br>Because a clustered sampling design reduces variance (e.g., 100 students from the same school are likely more similar to one another demographically than are 100 students from 100 different schools), it also reduces standard errors and thereby inflates the change for <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a>. To adjust for these design effects, a primary sampling unit variable (e.g., schools) and potentially a stratification variable are incorporated into analyses. Most statistical packages (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS) can adjust for a complex sampling design and typically the appropriate primary sampling unit and, if necessary, stratification variables are clearly identified within a data set's documentation files.

Descriptive\nExploratory\nInferential\nPredictive\nCausal\nMechanistic Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. The type of question you are asking directly informs how you interpret your results. A descriptive question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. There is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the set of data that you are working with. An exploratory question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. These types of analyses are also called 'hypothesis-generating' analyses because rather than testing a hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question, you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. An inferential question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data. A predictive question would be one where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal. In other instances, even if your data are not from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer a causal question. A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a mechanistic question. By necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions. If a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering the inferential question. The type of question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis).\nIf this type of data set does not exist, then the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illness. Establish your expectations about the question\nGathering information about your question\nDetermining if your expectations match the information you gathered, and then refining your question (or expectations) if your expectations did not match the information you gathered. There are five key characteristics of a good question for a data analysis, which range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already been answered to the more abstract characteristic that each of the possible answers to the question should have a single interpretation and be meaningful. The question should be of interest to your audience, the identity of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with data.\nYou should also check that the question has not already been answered. With the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon to discover that your question of interest has been answered already.\nThe question should also stem from a plausible framework. If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end up with an answer that's difficult to interpret or have confidence in. Many questions are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible framework. The question, should also, of course, be answerable.\nSpecificity is also an important characteristic of a good question. Working towards specificity will refine your question and directly inform what steps to take when you start looking at data.\nWith this degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will either recommend or not recommend the specific action. Another aspect to consider when you’re developing your question is what will happen when you translate it into a data problem. Every question must be operationalized as a data analysis that leads to a result. Pausing to think through what the results of the data analysis would look like and how they might be interpreted is important as it can prevent you from wasting a lot of time embarking on an analysis whose result is not interpretable. The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question that uses inappropriate data. The problem with this question is that for a single possible answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations arises when at least one of the variables you use is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after. To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required to answer your question. A related problem that intergeres with interpretation of results is confounding. Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship between factors. A brief description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both your exposure of interest and your outcome of interest. As you refine your question, spend time identifying the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information about these potential confounders. Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a biased result. The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics above what exists in the general population. A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors, bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person might recall the past when responding to a survey. The best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the question with the data available to you.

It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Henry Taube (who won the Novel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I did not know was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right answer or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. We don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid - that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity.' that kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, ‘I don’t know’. The point of the exam isn’t to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it’s the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student’s weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student’s knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.

A research question is a statement that identifies the phenomenon to be studied. For example, \"Does preschool influence children's language skills?\" Why are good research questions important and what makes them 'good?' Purpose\nRelevance\nFeasibility To produce a research question, you need to know the literature first. Find out what has been done and how you can contribute to the existing literature. I have a research question. If you do not have a research question, narrow down your topic. Review the literature\nIs the question viable, original. feasible?\nYou have a research question! Narrow down on an area of interest\nWithin that area, try to answer a question that: Has either not been addressed before\nHas been addressed before but that you could extend (i.e., new data-set, different approach, etc.)\nHas been addressed but requires replication\nStarts a new research area (NOT recommended) Read as much as you can on the topic\nRead recent studies first, then read backwards\nRead all relevant papers (or at least the influential ones)\nIdeas on the research topic often come from reading\nThe more you read, the easier it will be to come up with research questions Reviewing the literature will allow you to understand whether your question has been answered/is valid.\nBy reading previous studies, you might get ideas on how to tweak your original research question into a new one. Whether you have or do not have a research question, it is crucial that you review the literature in the area first. Many leave the review as the last step, but this is dangerous. Not original\nNot feasible Time constraint (e.g., not enough time)\nResources (e.g., lack of data)\nKnowledge (e.g., do I know method X?) Too broadly defined research question\nNot well justified\nNot motivated by literature Start searching for a topic as early as possible\nOnce you narrow down a topic/area, look at the relevant literature (i.e., a literature review)\nOnce you have done the literature review (has it already been done? No, why not? Is it interesting/relevant?), then ask yourself: Is the question specific (not too broad)?\nIs it feasible in the allotted time?\nDo I have enough resources (data) to answer this question?\nHow about knowledge (methods)?\nIs the research question falling within my area of research?\nIf the answer is yes to all the previous question, congratulations, you have a research question. Your time is your most important resource. Do not take a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances) Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic/data set\nMore efficient time use (e.g., read similar lit)\nLooks good when others are evaluating your CV A good research question will Allow outsiders to see your intentions\nHelp you develop hypotheses (not always)\nContributes to existing knowledge Contribution does not have to be huge\nReplication is a contribution\nFilling a gap is not enough justification, why does this gap matter? Guide the design of your methods\nAllow the target population to be identified\nIdentify the outcome variables and key predictors of those variables\nDetermine what type of study is needed (e.g., descriptive, correlational, experimental)\nIdentify background characteristics that might influence predictors and outcomes\nRaise questions about how to best collect data\nInfluence the number of participants in the study Writing a good question is an iterative process What do you want to learn about?\nDraft and redraft with increasing specificity using the guidelines listed above. Ask for feedback from colleagues (science is a collective effort).\nBuild on the work of others by conducting a systematic literature review. This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. Hook the reader in. Practice! Explain the larger context that this study will inform. Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. Flows directly from the earlier points in paragraph 1. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. State the basic aims, hypotheses, questions, and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths) Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph - could be theoretically, in terms of policy, filling holes, etc. Can be combined with paragraph 2 in some cases. \"The scientific literature is our institutional memory.

The main question of interest was the extent to which personality traits at the time of marriage predict marital satisfaction and marital commitment post marriage. The researcher wrote two papers. One focused on the prediction of marital satisfaction, and the other focused on the prediction of marital commitment. The design of the study was he same in each paper, with the exception of the change in outcomes. Piecemeal A researcher recruited newlyweds and planned annual assessments over a five years. Some measures were assessments over a five years. Some measures were common to each annual assessment, whereas others common to each annual assessment, whereas others were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote an article regarding the relation between divorce history an article regarding the relation between divorce history and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital satisfaction from those who did not experience the satisfaction from those who did not experience the transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The researcher decided to publish these as three separate researcher decided to publish these as three separate articles. Not Piecemeal Researcher B was interested in the relation between family process and adolescent adjustment. She conducted and published a study in which the main conducted and published a study in which the main objective was to identify specific family processes that objective was to identify specific family processes that mediated the relation between family structure and mediated the relation between family structure and adjustment. Later, she read a new study that proposed that two of the family processes that she studied had an interactive effect on adjustment. Although such an interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, in additional analyses she found that such an effect did occur in her sample, although in a slightly different than in the newly published article. She wrote a second article to address this issue. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the extent to which support for marriage from family and friends affects rating of relationship quality. He collected data from a large convenience sample. Although not planned, the sample contained about 60% of persons in their first marriages and 40% of persons in remarriages. The researcher prepared two papers that examined the question of interest. In the first paper, he used data from the first-marriage subjects, whereas in the second paper he used data from the remarried subjects. The variables assessed and reported in the two papers were the same. Piecemeal A researcher was interested in the links between family structure and child adjustment. The researcher administered a survey to high school students. She discovered that there were large numbers in two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families, but very few students were in the single divorced father and stepmother families as part of the survey, students in stepfamilies answered survey items regarding the parenting behaviors of their stepparents as well as of their parents. She wrote two papers. The first examined differences in adjustment in children from two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families (the groups with the largest sample sizes). To facilitate the interpretation of family structure effects, she decided to exclude the rather small number of students in the second paper, she explored whether children's adjustment was related to how they rated the parenting behaviors of their parents and stepparents. Not Piecemeal A researcher was interested in rates of divorce in first-marriages and remarriages in different countries. She obtained data from an international organization that contained information on a number of different countries and wrote two papers. The first addressed the divorce rates in these two kinds of couples in Canada, and the second dealt with the same issue in England. The same theoretical rationale and measures were used in both papers, although the results led to different conclusions. Piecemeal Focus on quality and not quantity of publications Replicate the study with a different sample, setting, or methodology. Do this if most of the past research you have read examines one type of sample, setting, or method. Examine the topic using a different design. If the study was a quasi- or non-experimental, conduct an experiment. Do this if causation has not been consistently established by past research, or it has not been consistently established with the population you are interested in. Examine how another variable might impact results Do this if you have research evidence to suggest that results may depend on another variable. Conduct a similar study with a different outcome or dependent variable. Do this if you find research evidence supporting the new associations you plan to examine. Being first is not always a sign of being a good scientist Many discoveries are wrong or over claimed. You do not show you are a great scientist by being the first to claim something. A large part of getting over being scooped is getting over yourself and realizing that science is bigger than any one of us. It also means you are doing something other people care about. If you are scooped, do not be discouraged. It is unlikely that any two researchers would address a question in the exact same way.

Variables with too few cases and/or a sparse distribution are suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2 and labelled 'suppressed' in the Electronic Codebook (ECB). The value -2 means that the data for this variable are suppressed to protect the respondent's confidentiality. Variables that provide a particularly identifying characteristic, such as a specific disability, or information that could be matched against external data sources to obtain a specific identifying characteristic, such as exact date of marriage or divorce, are also suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2. Will vary for different data, but for all, you will need to complete an application. Submit signed license document Primary researcher\nSenior official at institution Submit signed and notarized affidavits of nondisclosure for all proposed users. Submit a signed security plan (must specify the exact locked location) where the data will be secured. You cannot transmit restricted-use data.\nMaintain a data license file and ensure that all authorized users follow the agreed upon terms. Participate in unannounced security inspections to ensure compliance. Adhere to established publication rules. Submit all materials for disclosure review. Complete annual trainings online. Complete yearly reports of what work you have done. Start with a broad question. Think about who might collect that data (e.g., governments, other researchers, etc.) Want to stick close to a specific subfield or type of data? Look for recognized repositories in your field, large research projects, or publications that have data access statements. Likely need to combine several search strategies. Remember Some disciplines have more of a tradition of sharing\nNon-sensitive data are easier to obtain than sensitive data <br><img alt=\"3.

Searching by variable name is helpful when you are interested in a particular variable (e.g., spanking). Often, studies are organized into collections in each archive so a researcher can quickly identify groups of studies focused on a particular subarea. The organization of each archive varies, but most share several major features. Most archives allow you to perform basic descriptive analyses before the downloading a dataset. This is great because you can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in repsonses, for your purposes. Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. Most archives offer FAQs, tips for effective searching, and access to staff members via email. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/\" target=\"_self\">ICPSR tutorial</a> How to search for variables and filter\nHow to search for publications\nHow to look at descriptive within and across studies\nHow to look for studies and variables within studies\nStudy usage reports Subject Matter Consider whether the subject is consistent with your problem definition and whether the data apply to the time/population of interest Methods Consider whether the data can be used with your preferred method of analysis or if you'll need ot learn a new skill. Measurement Determine whether the data capture the measures and constructs you are interested in with sufficient/adequate detail. Time You will save time on data collection and get access to larger scale data, but may spend more time on cleaning, modifying, getting documentation, etc. License/Copyright Is the data licensed? Does it restrict usage? Terms of Use Are the terms you need to meet to gain access to the data or other restrictions? Citations You will want to formally cite the data you use; data sets should have a persistent identifier to help cite the data, such as DOI. Documentation Look for good documentation on how the data was collected, for what purpose, how it was transformed. Credibility Is the data from a recognized lab, researcher, institution? Do the publications based on the data hold? Does the dataset contain the information you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?\nDo the measures used match those you require?\nIs the data set a proxy for the data you really need?\nDoes the dataset cover the population that is the subject of your research?\nDoes the dataset cover the geographical area that is the subject of your research?\nCan data about the population that is the subject of your research be separated from unwanted data?\nAre the data for the right time period or sufficiently up to date?\nAre data available for all the variables you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?\nAre the variables defined clearly? How reliable is the dataset?\nHow credible is the data source?\nIs it clear what the source of the data is?\nDo the credentials of the source of the data (author, institution, or organization sponsoring the data) suggest it is likely to be reliable?\nDo the data have an associated copyright statement?\nDo associated published documents exist?\nDoes the source contain contact details for obtaining further information about the data?\nIs the method described clearly?\nIf sampling was used, what was the procedure and what were the associated sampling errors and response rates?\nWho was responsible for collecting or recording the data?\n(For surveys) Is a copy of the questionnaire or interview checklist included?\n(For compiled data) Are you clear how the data were analyzed and compiled?\nAre the data likely to contain measurement bias?\nWhat was the original purpose for which the data were collected?\nWho was the target The most important step is to read ALL the data documentation.

Sampling & Complex Designs","icon":"","description":"\nWhy should we strive for population representative sampling? Important for policy or practice. We do not want to recommend changes that are not based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact. How? Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)\nWork on large teams\nUse secondary data Normally used to compensate for over- and under-sampling of individuals\nExample It is common to over-sample minority groups... If we doubled the size of our minority sample, then each minority case would get a design weight of 1/2 or .5. We use the design weight when we want the statistics to be representative of the population. Used to compensate for the fact that persons with certain characteristics are not as likely to respond to the survey. Example Most population surveys have substantially more female than male respondents; because surveys over-represents females and under-represents males in the population, a weight is used to compensate for this bias. There are many responsent characteristics that are likely to be related to the propensity to respond such as age, education, race/ethnicity, place of residence. Dataset with cases Simple mean (4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 2.8 Weighted mean {(4 1) + (2 2) + (1 4) + (5 1) + (2 * 2)} / 10 = 2.1 With unweighted data, each case is counted equally\nWith weighted data, each case is counted relative to its representation in the population\nUnweighted data represent only those in the sample who provide data\nWeights allow analyses that represent the target population\n<img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs.png\" target=\"_self\"> Most STATA commands can deal with weighted data, where the weight is a variable in the dataset. You need to specify the type of weight and the weight variable, using brackets at the end of your command, as in:\nsummarize x [weight=weightvarname]\ntab x [weight=weightvarname]\nregress y x [weight=weightvarname]\nThere are 4 types of weights in STATA, but for most data analyses you will use one of the following: Probability pweights, for observations sampled with unequal probability of selection. Use this for inferential analyses.\nAnalytic aweights, for data containing averages where the average is weighted by the # obs used in calculating the average…. Use this for your descriptive statistics. <br><img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-1.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-1.png\" target=\"_self\">\nDifferent studies create different types of weights... Some data create weights depending on: Level of analysis (child, teacher, or school)\nType of analysis (cross-sectional vs. Longitudinal)\nSource of data (child assessment, parent interview, teacher questionnaires, etc.)\nFor example, the ECLS-K has ~ 105 different options Many suggest you use combination weights when estimating longitudinal analyses because they assume that these users will not adjust for attrition on their own. I suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights. Instead, use modern missing data procedures for attrition bias, and use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias I make this recommendation because attrition weights have two key disadvantages Attrition weights often reduce the analytical sample size, and thereby, statistical power. If many non-model variables related to missing data are incorporated, missing data techniques adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights Use weights whenever possible, but some methods do not allow weights\nSteps to follow to avoid vias in unweighted analyses <br>Include as <a data-href=\"Independent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independent Variable</a> that might account for the sample design or non-response\n<br>If a weight is available, it can also be included as an <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Independent Variable\" data-href=\"Independent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">IV</a>\nIf the weight is associated with the outcom ein a model including the design variables, then the weight is likely to have been constructed in a way related to your outcome; bias is possile. E.g., some multilevel models, some structural equation programs, etc. National samples are first divided into primary sampling units... What these units are depends on the study.\n- E.g., in many data of the US the PSUs are geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties<br>\n<img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-2.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-2.png\" target=\"_self\"> After identifying PSUs, then PSUs are stratified into groups. These groups are formed to keep similar units together... How many and what types of strata are determined by study goals.<br>\n<img alt=\"7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-3.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-3.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThen within each strata, and within PSUs, you sample Software can make the adjustment... A few different approaches with the easiest being the Taylor Series approach Use primary sampling unit (PSU) and strata variables in the data file. The strata and PSU identifiers are often associated with a specific sampling weight variable. For example, in the ECLS-K the weight C1CW0 has the following strata and PSU: C1TVWSTR and C1TCWPSU svyset PSU [pweight = WEIGHT], strata(STRATA)\nThen use svy: before your subsequent commands (e.g., svy: tab or svy: mean or svy: regress)\nsvy: will NOT work with all commands\nsvy: mean and mean [weight = weight] yield the same mean estimates… it is the SEs that are different)<br>\n<img alt=\"7.

You will continue to use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2011 Cohort.&nbsp;The classwork/homework write-up is due by Tuesday at 11:59PM (3/18).&nbsp;The data you need come from two sources. The first is the data file you have been working on for class activities the last several week. The second is located in this week's folder. A researcher wants to know whether maternal depressive symptoms are associated with children’s early learning and development. But before the researcher can address this question, you are asked to think about and address missing data. The researcher has provided you with several variables in addition to the variables you have worked with thus far:\nYou are asked to include an overall composite of depressive symptoms. The research provides you with 12 items that you are asked to composite (P2BOTHER P2APPETI P2BLUE P2KPMIND P2DEPRES P2EFFORT P2FEARFL P2RESTLS P2TALKLS P2LONELY P2SAD P2NOTGO).\nYou will also include three child variables: a) a variable capturing children’s academic achievement, b) a variable capturing children’s socioemotional skills, and c) a variable capturing children’s executive functioning. For the academic achievement measure, you will need to create a new composite variable that is composed of reading, math, and science (X2RSCALK4 X2MSCALK4 X2SSCALK4). For socioemotional skills, you will need to create a new variable that is the average of teacher reports of self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior (i.e.,&nbsp;X2TCHINT X2TCHEXT X2TCHCON X2TCHPER). Children’s executive functioning skills are captured with a single item:&nbsp;X2DCCSTOT.\nThe researcher also wants you to include covariates/indicators for race/ethnicity (X_RACETH_R), child sex (X_CHSEX_R), income (X2INCCAT_I), parents’ marital status (P1CURMAR), parents physical health (P2HEALTH), household members under 18 (X1LESS18), and household members over 18 (X1OVER18) .\nWith that in mind...Step 1: You need to merge the new data into the dataset you have been working with. This requires a 1 to 1 merge using CHILDID. This step will be graded via your do/log files (.25 points)Step 2: Once the data are merged, examine your data. Orient yourself to the old and new variables (e.g., are they continuous, categorical etc etc) and&nbsp;recode&nbsp;any new variables as appropriate. Recall how Stata recognizes missing data. Please also&nbsp;create&nbsp;the appropriate composites&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to imputation. The composites will be what you will use in your imputation.&nbsp;If you recode other variables, please provide a justification. This step will be graded via your do/log files and your justification in your word document. (.25 points) Step 3: Once you have cleaned your data,&nbsp;run&nbsp;some descriptives for all of your variables (including your covariates) and determine the degree of missing values for each variable. Please also estimate a correlation matrix for your focal independent and dependent variables (do&nbsp;not&nbsp;include the list of covariates for your correlation matrix). What &nbsp;patterns you notice from the descriptive statistics? How much missing data are there for the variables? What patterns do you notice from the correlation matrix? (1.00 point) Step 4:&nbsp;Determine&nbsp;whether data are MCAR. Examine and discuss the missing data patterns. Are there common patterns of missing data? Are there uncommon patterns of missing data? Anything you notice worth discussing? If data are not MCAR, discuss whether the data may meet assumptions of MAR or MNAR. Why or why not? If you have any concerns proceeding to imputation, discuss it here. (1.25 points) Step 5:&nbsp;Run&nbsp;an imputation model with 10 datasets. Make sure you specify each variable correctly. And remember to&nbsp;upload&nbsp;your do and log files (for the entire assignment). This step will be graded via your do file (1.00 point) Step 6: After you have run your imputation,&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;descriptives&nbsp;within&nbsp;the 10 imputed datasets. You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to do this for every variable. Run these descriptives for the focal variables of interest (depressive symptoms, children's academic achievement, social skills, and executive functioning). Use the mi xeq command (e.g., mi xeq: sum XYZ). Discuss what you notice about the means/SDs across the imputations. (1.00 point)Step 7.&nbsp;Estimate&nbsp;correlations (use mi xeq: corr) among your focal variables from step 1, but this time&nbsp;within&nbsp;your 10 datasets. Are there any similarities between the imputed and non-imputed data? Are there any other differences you notice? (.75 points) Step 8. Upload your word document, log file, and do file. Please upload stata versions of your log/do files (not copied/pasted into word).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741193467825,"modifiedTime":1741193511396,"sourceSize":4923,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Assignment 4.md","exportPath":"secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"secondary-data-analysis/contextual-outlier.html":{"title":"Contextual Outlier","icon":"","description":"\nDeviates significantly with respect to a specific context of the object\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/contextual-outlier.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740958240831,"modifiedTime":1740958244013,"sourceSize":73,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Contextual Outlier.md","exportPath":"secondary-data-analysis/contextual-outlier.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"secondary-data-analysis/global-outliers.html":{"title":"Global Outliers","icon":"","description":"\nDeviates significantly from the rest of the dataset\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/secondary-data-analysis/global-outliers.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740958252589,"modifiedTime":1740958255566,"sourceSize":53,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Global Outliers.md","exportPath":"secondary-data-analysis/global-outliers.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"secondary-data-analysis/stata-command-guide.html":{"title":"STATA Command Guide","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"5.
