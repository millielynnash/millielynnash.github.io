The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step foot on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson Library. Only assigned enforcers, members of the Bucket and Dipper club, were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. 1922, the Lantern reported members of Bucket and Dipper would even defend freshmen from being dunked in the lake by those who were not permitted to do so, i.e. non-Bucket Dipper members. \"Bucket and Dipper announces that no promiscuous 'ducking' or 'dipping' is to take place under the auspices of other organizations. Any attempt to haze freshmen in this manner by other organizations will result in Bucket and Dipper's strong-arm squad defending the freshmen.\"\nThe student council rejected alternatives to the dunking in Mirror Lake put forth by faculty members.\n1922 was the last tug-of-war across Mirror Lake. University president said, \"The University is trying to make the lake a place of as much beauty as possible.\" 1926: Freshmen got fed up with dunking into Mirror Lake and planned an event to burn the hats they were forced to wear. A huge fight ensued and police were called to the scene. Sophomore was hospitalized. 1929: \"For all practical purposes, freshmen rules are already a thing of the past. Although several attempts have been made to revive the freshmen taboos, and particularly the cap-wearing tradition, the rules have been virtually non-existent since Bucket and Dipper was shorn of its power to enforce them.\" Mirror Lake Fountain (1931): 1942: Tug-of-war made another appearance for tradition week and stuck around for May week in following years. Ariel View (1947): Mirror Lake (1950s):\nLast known reference of tug-of-war across the lake. In 1955, references to dunking popped back up in a Lantern editorial with the following reasons given for dunking: honorary initiates, fraternity seniors, pinned or engaged couples and any other willing soul. Mirror Lake facing North East (1961): 1964: An engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. 1967: Last reference of Bucket and Dipper initiating members by dunking them in Mirror Lake.

Depending on the number of process characteristics to be monitored, there are two basic types of control charts. The first, referred to as a univariate control chart, is a graphical display (chart) of&nbsp;one&nbsp;quality characteristic. The second, referred to as a multivariate control chart, is a graphical display of a statistic that summarizes or represents&nbsp;more than one&nbsp;quality characteristic. Characteristics of control charts If a single quality characteristic has been measured or computed from a sample, the control chart shows the value of the quality characteristic versus the sample number or versus time. In general, the chart contains a center line that represents the mean value for the in-control process. Two other horizontal lines, called the upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL), are also shown on the chart. These control limits are chosen so that almost all of the data points will fall within these limits as long as the process remains in-control. The figure below illustrates this. <img alt=\"6. One-Sample T-Test, Power 1.gif\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-1.gif\" target=\"_self\">\nWhy control charts \"work\" The control limits as pictured in the graph might be 0.001&nbsp;probability&nbsp;limits. If so, and if chance causes alone were present, the probability of a point falling above the upper limit would be one out of a thousand, and similarly, a point falling below the lower limit would be one out of a thousand. We would be searching for an assignable cause if a point would fall outside these limits. Where we put these limits will determine the risk of undertaking such a search when in reality there is no assignable cause for variation.\nSince two out of a thousand is a very small risk, the 0.001 limits may be said to give practical assurances that, if a point falls outside these limits, the variation was caused be an assignable cause. It must be noted that two out of one thousand is a purely arbitrary number. There is no reason why it could not have been set to one out a hundred or even larger. The decision would depend on the amount of risk the management of the quality control program is willing to take. In general (in the world of quality control) it is customary to use limits that approximate the 0.002 standard.\nLetting&nbsp;X&nbsp;denote the value of a process characteristic, if the system of chance causes generates a variation in&nbsp;X&nbsp;that follows the normal distribution, the 0.001 probability limits will be very close to the 3σ&nbsp;limits. From normal tables we glean that the 3σ&nbsp;in one direction is 0.00135, or in both directions 0.0027. For normal distributions, therefore, the 3σ&nbsp;limits are the practical equivalent of 0.001 probability limits. Plus or minus \"3 sigma\" limits are typical In the U.S.,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;X&nbsp;is normally distributed or not,&nbsp;it is an acceptable practice to base the control limits upon a multiple of the standard deviation. Usually this multiple is 3 and thus the limits are called 3-sigma limits. This term is used whether the standard deviation is the universe or population parameter, or some estimate thereof, or simply a \"standard value\" for control chart purposes. It should be inferred from the context what standard deviation is involved. (Note that in the U.K., statisticians generally prefer to adhere to probability limits.)\nIf the underlying distribution is skewed, say in the positive direction, the 3-sigma limit will fall short of the upper 0.001 limit, while the lower 3-sigma limit will fall below the 0.001 limit. This situation means that the risk of looking for assignable causes of positive variation when none exists will be greater than one out of a thousand. But the risk of searching for an assignable cause of negative variation, when none exists, will be reduced. The net result, however, will be an increase in the risk of a chance variation beyond the control limits. How much this risk will be increased will depend on the degree of skewness.\nIf variation in quality follows a Poisson distribution, for example, for which&nbsp;np&nbsp;= 0.8, the risk of exceeding the upper limit by chance would be raised by the use of 3-sigma limits from 0.001 to 0.009 and the lower limit reduces from 0.001 to 0. For a Poisson distribution the mean and variance both equal&nbsp;np. Hence the upper 3-sigma limit is 0.8 + 3&nbsp;sqrt(0.8) = 3.48 and the lower limit is 0 (here&nbsp;sqrt&nbsp;denotes \"square root\"). For&nbsp;np&nbsp;= 0.8 the probability of getting more than 3 successes is 0.009. Strategies for dealing with out-of-control findings If a data point falls outside the control limits, we assume that the process is probably out of control and that an investigation is warranted to find and eliminate the cause or causes.\nDoes this mean that when all points fall within the limits, the process is in control? Not necessarily. If the plot looks non-random, that is, if the points exhibit some form of systematic behavior, there is still something wrong. For example, if the first 25 of 30 points fall above the center line and the last 5 fall below the center line, we would wish to know why this is so. Statistical methods to detect sequences or nonrandom patterns can be applied to the interpretation of control charts. To be sure, \"in control\" implies that all points are between the control limits and they form a random pattern.

Write conclusion Janet is interested in determining if depression scores of male adolescents who do not engage in sports are significantly different from the average male adolescent. To test this hypothesis, she obtains Kansas University Depression Inventory (KUDI) scores from 30 adolescent boys who have indicated on a questionnaire that they do not engage in sports outside of school gym classes. Past research has shown that the mean depression score for male adolescents in the population in the population is 50. Janet wants to determine if the mean KUDI score for the 30 adolescents is different from the value of 50.

Therefore, we reject H0. Take a look at the actual difference between the sample mean and the population mean: tobs = 2.457 vs. tcrit = 2.045\nAre you comfortable calling that difference significant? Alternative (or Supplement) to significance value: Cohen's d Cohen's d is an effect size measure used to indicate the difference between two means. For one-sample t-test, d indicates how many standard deviations the sample mean is away from the hypothesized mean. If d = 1.0, the sample mean is one standard deviation away from the hypothesized mean. d = (x-bar - 𝜇0) / s\nd = t / √n\nEffect size measures strength of relationship:\nOne-Sample Effect Sizes\nd = 2.457 / √30 = .4486\nd = 4.633 / 10.327 = .4486 A lot of times before conducting your study you need to submit a power analysis. This lets you know what sample size you need to find an effect. Power is the probability that a test of significance will detect deviation from the null hypothesis if one truly exists. A Priori Power Determine how many cases you will need to have a good chance of detecting an effect of a specified size with the desired amount of power. Imagine you are designing a new study to see if depression scores are higher in a new group of students. Using alpha = .01, what sample size would you suggest to detect a 1/2 standard deviation difference from the population mean, with 90% power? In this example, we have one-tailed test. Effect size is 0.5, alpha level is 0.01 and the desired power is 0.90.\nBased on these criteria, the required sample size for our one-sample t-test is 55. A Post Hoc Power Determine how much power you would have if you had a specified number of cases. In SPSS example (Kudi), we have a two-tailed test. The observed effect size was 0.449. The alpha level we tested was 0.05, and the actual sample size was 30. Based on these criteria, the power hoc power is 0.662 A one sample t-test was conducted on the KUDI scores to evaluate whether their mean was significantly different from 50, the mean for male adolescent in general. The sample mean of 54.63 (SD = 10.33) was significantly different from 50, (t (29) = 2.46, p = .02). The 95% confidence interval for the KUDI mean ranged from 50.78 to 58.49. The effect size d of .45 indicates a medium effect (Cohen, 1988). The post hoc power of the test, given the sample size, two-tailed, alpha level, and observed effect size, was .662 (M = 54.63, SD = 10.33).\nNote for future reference: When SPSS reports a p-value of .000, we indicate it in the results section as 'p-value &lt; .001.'

The results of the correlation analysis are presented in Table 1. The correlations of academic self-concept with other self-concept measures tend to be lower. The strongest correlation was between friends self-concept and intimate self-concept (r = .552). In research papers, correlations are typically discussed along with descriptive statistics, sometimes being reported within the same table. They are used to describe how the variables in your data relate to one another. Typically, correlations are just presented in a table, after (or with) the descriptive statistics. Having the legend of ** is common.

Representative of a population. This allows the sample to be generalizable to the population. Results will be applicable to other samples drawn from the same population. Every member of the population of interest has an equal probability of being selected. Selection of one unit has no effect on the selection of another unit. Best technique to obtain a representative sample. Use a number table, a compute, a drawing, or a lottery system to generate random numbers. Use if one or more characteristics are focal research interest. The goal is to compare groupds (strata). The purpose is to make sure each group is represented in the sample. First divide population into groups (strata). Then a random sample is taken from each group. There are 'naturally occurring' groups in population, usually geographical or organizational. Randomly selected clusters. Then sample all units within each cluster, or random sample with each chosen cluster. Error is smaller if the clusters are similar to each other. Every k^th unit is selected from a list, where k=population/desired sample size. Have a list with all units in the population. Then take sample systematically. Make sure the list you are selecting from is random. Choose samples merely based on proximity without considering whether they represent the population or not.

Example: County of residence, religion, political affiliation, ethnicity\nDichotomous: Sex assigned at birth (male or female)\nWhether a person voted in an election (yes or no).

Represent the features and properties of a variable. Help us understand how to describe and analyze the data. S. S. Stevens (1951) developed 4 types of measurement scales that could be used for assigning these values: Usually used for qualitative/categorical variables\nNumbers mark distinctions between responses, and nothing more. The numbers have no inherent meaning, and the order does not matter at all. Example: County of residence (1=Franklin, 2=Delaware, 3=Union OR 1=Delaware, 2=Union, 3=Franklin)\nSex assigned at birth (0=female, 1=male OR 10=female, 15=male) In SPSS, can set value labels and display either data or label. Numbers are assigned to represent ranks or order (usually discrete). Numbers have meaning, but only in terms of distinguishing order, from largest to smallest (or vice versa). Equal distance between two adjacent levels are not assumed. Example: Letter grades: A, B, C, D, E (1-5) Size of a cup of coffee (small, medium, large, 1-3)\nSocioeconomic status (SES) (low, middle, high, 1-3)\nAgreement (Likert Scale) (strongly agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree, 1-5) Sometimes data needs to be recorded to make interpretation more intuitive Equal intervals or increments along the scale\nInterval variables have an arbitrary zero point. Example: Temperature Celsius or Fehrenheit, SAT score, credit score\nLikert Scale (equal distance assumed): More choices for statistical methods are available for interval data than ordinal data. Decisions might depend on your data. Report range to help readers understand the measure. Equal intervals or increments along the scale and contains an absolute and true zero point (absence of the phenomena being measured, data measures from 0 and above).\nIt is possible to compare 2 values and say one is 'twice as large' or 'two-third the size' Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Open the SPSS application\nFile -&gt; New -&gt; Data File -&gt; Open -&gt; Data -&gt; select the desired file File -&gt; Open -&gt; Data -&gt; change 'Files of Type' to: Excel -&gt; select the desired file\nFile -&gt; Import Data -&gt; Excel -&gt; select the desired file If the excel file has column titles, click 'Read variable names' from the first row of data.

The scatterplot is useful for providing a quick indication of the nature of the relationship among variables x and y (bivariate data). Direction of the relationship (positive or negative): A positive relationship occurs when both variables are increasing. A negative (inverse) relation occurs when one variable is increasing as the other is decreasing. Can draw a straight line (aka regression line) through the data points that cuts the bivariate distribution in hald. The slope of the regression line shows the direction of relationship.\nAlternatively, split the chart into 4 equal sections (quadrants) and examine how data points are spread across the 4 quadrants. Strength of the relationship: Strong relationships: Data points tend to fall close to the regression line. Weak relationship: Data points are widely scattered around the regression line.

Descriptive Statistics","icon":"","description":"\nWhat do we do when we have research questions about a large sample of data? Carrying around the entire collection of data would be very difficult. Descriptive statistics summarize the data in an abbreviated fashion, but they provide sufficient information to depict the data. 𝑥i: The score for ith person in the study or data set on variable x. Taking the sum of a set of scores is utilized quite often in statistics so we need a common system of notation for communicating about summation. En=1 xi: The sum of all data points of variable x. i=1 is the lower limit or beginning of the summation. i=n refers to the last person or the end of a data set. Ages from a sample of 10 coworkers: 24, 26, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46\nn= 10 observations (subjects) Use N to notate size of the entire population. E10=1 xi = 24+26+28+28+31+31+31+35+38+47 = 318 Excel: =SUM (data range)\nAll excel formulas in this class are optional (but useful) A single index or value summarizing the entire collection of scores. Three most popular measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode. Mode: Most common or frequent value Median (Mdn): 50th percentile (or Q 2) or the middlemost value of an ordered set of scores. Mean: Arithmetic average The value in a distribution of scores that occurs most frequently. Sometimes there is no mode, and sometimes there are multiple modes. When there are two modes (bimodal distributions), some people report both modes. If they are adjacent, some people average the two modes. Goal is to faithfully describe the distribution of your data. Coworker example: 24, 26, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46\nA new guy just joined the team: 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 Can be used with any type of measurement scales. Pros: simple to obtain, the only appropriate measure for nominal data. Cons: does not always have a unique value, not a function of all scores, difficult to deal with mathematically. We already know a lot about median (P50 or Q 2): Middle most value in an ordered set of data. After ordering the data, locate the ((n+1)/2) th observation. Coworker example (odd number): 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 New guy just quit (even number): 24, 26, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 Can be used with ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Pros: Not influenced by extreme scores (outliers)\nAlways has a unique value Cons: Not a function of all scores\nDifficult to deal with mathematically Sample Mean = (sum of xi)/n Coworker example: 318/10 = 31.8\nExcel: =Average (data range) Used to estimate population mean The larger our sample, the better our estimate of the true population mean. Only appropriate for interval and ratio measurement scales. Pros: Function of every score. Always has a unique value. Easy to deal with mathematically. Most stable of the measures of central tendency. Cons: Influenced by extreme scores. Very unusual or 'extreme'values tend to draw the mean towards these values and contribute to skew in the data. Coworker example: 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46 Mean: 31.8\nMedian: 31\nMode: 31 A retired guy just rejoined the team: 24, 26, 28, 28, 28, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38, 46, 75 Mean: 393/11 = 35.7\nMedian: 31\nMode: 31 For samples from a symmetric distribution (e.g., normal), mean, median, and mode should be very close to each other. When mean, median, and mode are far from each other, the data is skewed. Skewed to the right (long right tail, positive skew): Extreme large values\nSkewed to the left (long left tail, negative skew): Extreme small values <img alt=\"Symmetrical Distribution.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/symmetrical-distribution.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Skewedness.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/skewedness.png\" target=\"_self\">\nSometimes we may have the means of several groups of people, and we still want to find the average. Two ways to do this: Weighted Average (average all the original scores): Takes into account of each group's sample size. Average is appropriate 'weighted' by number of observations in each group. Unweighted Average (simply take the mean of the averages): Does not 'weight' or take account of the different sample sizes. AKA: mean of means, grand mean, usually used for group comparison. Example (Weight Average): 8150/100=81.5\nUnweighted average: (85+80+75)/3=80 The mean alone is not enough to tell us about the shape of a distribution. Measures of dispersion describe the amount of variability among the scores (i.e., do the scores fall close to the central tendency measure or are the scores spread out?)\n<br><img alt=\"Standard Deviations.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviations.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThere are no measures of dispersion appropriate for nominal data. We already know two measures of dispersion: Range and Interquartile range (IQR)\nBoth are measures of dispersion, but not a function of all scores. They are informative measures, but don't have very strong statistical properties. Difference between the largest and smallest scores. Pros: Simple to obtain. Cons: Influenced by extreme scores, only a function of two of the scores, unstable from sample to sample. Difference between the third quartile (Q 3) and the first quartiles (Q 1)\nAKA H spread (stands for hinge, middle 50% of the distribution), developed by Tukey. Pros: Unaffected by extreme scores. Cons: Not a function of all scores, not very stable from sample to sample. The 'average' squared deviation from the mean for a set of scores. Variance is a better measure of dispersion than range and IQR, because it takes into account all the values for a set of scores (but might be affected by extreme values). Conceptually, the variance is a measure of the area of the distribution (i.e., the more spread out the scores, the more area or space the distribution takes up). The sample mean might not be the same as the population mean (usually unknown), and the deviations would be affected. Therefore, sample variance obtained would be systematically too small. In order to get an unbiased sample estimate of the population variance, a slight change in the computational formula was made. AKA Degree of Freedom (df) When we calculate a simple statistic based in part on another statistic, we have to consider the 'degrees of freedom' in our calculation. Given the sample mean, we do not need raw data from all n observations. We only need (n-1) observations, because the last missing score can be found from the mean (i.e., there is no 'freedom' in what this score might be).\nThe denominator (n-1) in sample variance is called the degrees of freedom (df), which is related to sample size. You may see many different forms of formulas out there to compute variances and forthcoming descriptive statistics. They all come from the same 'definitional' formula, but after being modified/simplified given the mathematical properties, some 'computational' formulas are easier to deal with by hand. But excel or SPSS will compute them for us anyway. Since variance is a squared value, it is difficult to interpret. The standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance, and it is the most common measure of dispersion. For population: 𝜎 = square root of 𝜎2\nFor sample: 𝜎 = square root of 𝜎2\nMeasured on the same scale as original data. Interpretation: On average, the deviations from the mean, but on average the distance from the mean is about 2.92. The 68-95-99.7 rule (more next time): About 68% of data points fall within +/- 1 standard deviation from the mean. About 95% of data points fall within +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean. About 99.7% of data points fall within +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean. Measure the shared variance (or co-variance) between variables x and y.\n<br><img alt=\"3.

Other measures are needed. Correlation coefficients are measures of relationship that are easier to interpret. The first correlation coefficient we consider is the Pearson correlation coefficient (usually notated as r), which measures the relationship between two interval or ratio variables. <br><img alt=\"3.

An event having a probability of 1 means that no other event can possibly occur. \"In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\" (Benjamin Franklin, 1789) Related to 0, although you cannot speak of an event occurring less than never, you can have an event with 0 probability. \"You can't win the lottery if you don't buy a ticket.\" Long ago many disciplines found that a particular bell-shaed or normal curve occurred often with many different variables (recall histograms).\nLater in the 1700 s, mathematicians were called on to find an equation to approximate the normal distribution. If an equation could be developed then the probability associated with any point on the curve could be determined. Until 1920, the development of the equation was attributed to Karl Friedrich Gauss, and it was known as the Gaussian curve. Then Pearson, however, found this equation written earlier than Gauss's time in an article by Abraham DeMoivre in 1733 and renamed the curve as the normal distribution. <img alt=\"4.

P (z ≤ 1) - P (z ≤-1)= 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826 95.4% data within 2 standard deviations from the mean?

P (z ≤ 1) - P (z ≤ -1) = 0.9987 - 0.0013 = 0.9974 In a recent census, the average income for several large rural counties was 𝜇 = $35, 285 and the standard deviation was 𝜎 = $7,200. What proportion of families have incomes below $35,000? Want to find P (x&lt;35000)\nConvert x ($) to z, given mean and standard deviation: Z = (x-𝜇)/𝜎 = (35000-35285)/7200 = -0.04\nSo we are looking for P (z ≤ -0.04) = 0.4840 About 48.4% of families had household incomes below $35,000. What was the 80th percentile household income? Use z-table to find the z score with cumulative probability 80% (area is 0.8000).\nZ = 0.845 (between 0.84 and 0.85 from table)\nConvert to $ (recall z = (x-𝜇)/𝜎): X = (𝜇 + z)(𝜎) = (35,285 + 0.845)(7200) ≈ 41369 The 80th percentile household income was $41,369. Learning a new instrument is exciting, but it takes consistent practicing to truly make music. A study shows aspiring musicians usually spend about 30 minutes practicing every day, with a standard deviation of 12.5 minutes. Assuming the practice time follows a normal distribution, what is the probability of a student practicing more than 70 minutes a day? We want to find P (x &gt; 70)\nConvert x to z, given mean and standard deviation: Z = (x-𝜇)/𝜎) = (70-30)/12.5 = 3.2 So we are looking for P (z &gt; 3.2) From z-table, P (z ≤ 3.2) = 0.9993 (table only gives area to the left. )\nSo P (z &gt; 3.2) = 1-0.9993 = 0.0007 There is only a slight chance (0.07%) that a student would practice more than 70 minutes a day. The GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item assessment) is a short questionnaire used to screen for anxiety. GAD-7 scores range from 0 to 21 and indicate the severity of generalized anxiety. In a clinical study based on 90 participants, the distribution of GAD-7 scores followed a normal distribution with a mean of 6.3 and a standard deviation of 2.8. Given the descriptive statistics, how many participants were considered to have moderate anxiety? Probability between 10 and 15 is P (x ≤ 15) - P (x ≤ 10). I used range 10-15 to include the score of 14. P (z ≤ (15-6.3)/2.8) - P (z ≤ 3.11) - P (z ≤ 1.32)\nFrom z-table: 0.991 - 0.9066 = 0.0925 ≈ 9.3%\nAbout 9.3% of the 90 participants had a GAD-7 score between 10 to 14. That is about 8 individuals (90 x 9.3% ≈ 8) who were considered to have moderate anxiety. The average June daily high temperature in Ohio is 80˚F, with a standard deviation of 3 degrees. Normality assumed, what are the expected range (high and low) of daily high temperatures 95% of the time? Find the middle 95% range from z-table: each tail is (1-0.95)/2 = (0.05/2) = 0.025\nZ for upper limit (can be notated as z0.025): 1.96 (area to the left is 0.9750)\nZ for lower limit: -1.96 (area to the left is 0.0250) Notice the two z scores have the same value but different signs (symmetric). Middle 95% range for z: 0 ± 1.96 or (-1.96, 1.96)\nConvert to temperature (𝜇 ± 1.96 x 𝜎): 80 ± 1.96 x 3 = 80 ± 5.88 = (74.86)\n95% of the time, June daily high temperature in Ohio fluctuates between 74˚F and 86˚F. Analyze -&gt; Descriptive Statistics -&gt; Descriptives Check option Save standardized values as variables. Negative and decimal values occur in a standard normal distribution, thus other types of standardized scores have been developed, such as: SAT (College Board): µ = 500, 𝜎 = 100\nIQ: µ = 100, 𝜎 = 15\nNormal Curve Equivalent (NCE): µ = 50, 𝜎 = 21.06 Many analyses require the normality assumption (i.e., variables should be normally distributed in the populaiton). Most tests are robust against such violations if sample size is large (30).\nHowever, non-normality is often associated with biased standard deviations, which affects decision making in hypothesis testing. If non-normality is severe, we might need to transform the data. For non-normal and small samples, other alternative nonparametric tests are available. Recall boxplot: Is the median in the middle of the box? Recall Central Tendency: Is median close to the mean? Compare Histogram (data) to normal curve (theory): SPSS: In Histogram, check option Display normal curve. Skewness and kurtosis ratios within ±2 or ±3. Forthcoming: Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot)\nTests for normality: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test \"Whenever the smallest or the largest observation is less than one standard deviation from the mean, this is evidence of severe skew.\" This suggests that the distribution of scores is very compressed on one side of the mean. SPSS measures skewness by the 3 rd moment about the mean: ∑(z3/n) If normal, this measure should be 0. Negative (Skew to the left)\nPositive (Skew to the right) Skewed if standardized skewness |skew÷se (skew)| ≥ 2 (large sample) or ≥ 3 (small sample) Se(skew) is the standard error of the skewness measure. Access \"whether or not there are more or fewer extreme scores than expected in a normal distribution.\" Generally, kurtosis is less concerning than skewness. SPSS measures kurtosis by the 4th moment about the mean: ∑(z4÷n) - 3 If normal (mesokurtic), this measure should be 0. Negative kurtosis (platykurtic): flat or broad\nPositive kurtosis (leptokurtic): slender or narrow Non-normal if standardized kurtosis |kurtosis÷se (kurtosis)| ≥ 2 (large sample) or ≥ 3 (small sample) is the standard error of the kurtosis measure. <br><img alt=\"Kurtosis Graph.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/kurtosis-graph.png\" target=\"_self\">\nStatistics\nSkewness: / = (-0.978) / (0.083) = -11.78 Negative skew (to the left) Kurtosis / = (0.899) / (0.167) = 5.38 Leptokurtic (narrow) Descriptive Statistics Statistics Skewness: / = (0.089) / (0.083) = 1.07 Within ±2: Normal Kurtosis / = (-0.677) / (0.167) = -4.05 Leptokurtic (narrow) ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Statistics/ESQREM-6641","#Statistics/Z-Scores","#Lecture"],"headers":[{"heading":"Brief Introduction to Probability","level":2,"id":"Brief_Introduction_to_Probability_0"},{"heading":"Definition of Probability","level":3,"id":"Definition_of_Probability_0"},{"heading":"Properties of Probability","level":3,"id":"Properties_of_Probability_0"},{"heading":"Where did the Normal Distribution Come From?","level":3,"id":"Where_did_the_Normal_Distribution_Come_From?_0"},{"heading":"Normal Distribution","level":3,"id":"Normal_Distribution_0"},{"heading":"A Standard Curve","level":2,"id":"A_Standard_Curve_0"},{"heading":"A Family of Normal Curves","level":2,"id":"A_Family_of_Normal_Curves_0"},{"heading":"A <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Continuous Variable\" data-href=\"Continuous Variable\" href=\"Continuous Variable\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Continuous</a> Curve","level":2,"id":"A_[[Continuous_Variable|Continuous]]_Curve_0"},{"heading":"Probability: Area Under the Curve","level":2,"id":"Probability_Area_Under_the_Curve_0"},{"heading":"Standard Normal Distribution (z-score)","level":2,"id":"Standard_Normal_Distribution_(z-score)_0"},{"heading":"Z-Table and Area Under the Curve","level":2,"id":"Z-Table_and_Area_Under_the_Curve_0"},{"heading":"Use Z-Table to Confirm the 68-95-99.7 Rule","level":2,"id":"Use_Z-Table_to_Confirm_the_68-95-99.7_Rule_0"},{"heading":"Example: Household Income","level":3,"id":"Example_Household_Income_0"},{"heading":"Example: Practice","level":3,"id":"Example_Practice_0"},{"heading":"Example: Anxiety","level":3,"id":"Example_Anxiety_0"},{"heading":"Example: Ohio's Weather in June","level":3,"id":"Example_Ohio's_Weather_in_June_0"},{"heading":"Use SPSS to Convert a Variable to Z Scores (optional)","level":2,"id":"Use_SPSS_to_Convert_a_Variable_to_Z_Scores_(optional)_0"},{"heading":"Other Types of Standardized Scores (Optional)","level":3,"id":"Other_Types_of_Standardized_Scores_(Optional)_0"},{"heading":"Is the Data Normally Distributed?","level":2,"id":"Is_the_Data_Normally_Distributed?_0"},{"heading":"Skewness","level":2,"id":"Skewness_0"},{"heading":"Kurtosis","level":2,"id":"Kurtosis_0"},{"heading":"HS GPA &amp; ACT Example: Skewness and Kurtosis (GPA)","level":3,"id":"HS_GPA_&_ACT_Example_Skewness_and_Kurtosis_(GPA)_0"},{"heading":"GPA","level":4,"id":"GPA_0"},{"heading":"ACT","level":4,"id":"ACT_0"}],"links":["glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html","glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/lecture/4.-normal-distribution-(z-scores).html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/4.-normal-distribution-(z-scores).html","university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviations-1.html","university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/4.-normal-distribution-(z-scores)-2.html","university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/kurtosis-graph.html"],"createdTime":1717448440758,"modifiedTime":1740437790889,"sourceSize":13131,"sourcePath":"University Resources/Statistics Classes/Educational Statistics 6641/Lecture/4.

Sampling Distribution of the Mean (One-Sample Z-Test)","icon":"","description":"\nHere we begin to move from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics. After collecting sample data and generating sample statistics, we may also want to know to what extend we can generalize from these sample statistics to their corresponding population parameters (e.g., What does x tell us about µ?)\nWe already understand how probability and distribution(s) work. Now we want to know (a) how much uncertainty exists in our sample statistics, and (b) how much confidence can we place in our sample statistics. Inferential statistics allow us to make an inference or generalization from a sample to the population. Step 1: Population of interest Step 2: Draw sample Step 3: Compute sample statistics Step 4: Make inference back to the population Allows you to grow 30 plants simultaneously in just two square feet.

AI-powered with 24/7 plant monitoring. N = 20 Mean µ = 181.9\n225.36 Each sample has n = 4\nAll sample means 𝑥 have been calculated. Mean of the sampling distribution of the mean µx = 165.36\nStandard Error of the Mean 𝜎x = 121.48\nHow does 𝜎x compare to 𝜎? In our Gardyn pricing experiment, we took random samples of size n = 4 students and recorded each sample's mean x1, x2, x3,… and many other samples. Each sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean. We can construct a frequency distribution of sample means, known as the sampling distribution of the mean. It is the distribution of x for all possible samples of size n. The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean (µx) is the estimate of population mean (i.e., µx = µ). Sampling error (x - µx): the difference (deviation) between a particular sample mean and the population mean. Variance error of the mean (𝜎 2/x): the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean. Standard error of the mean (𝜎x): the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. As sample size n increases (say 30), the sampling distribution of the mean from a random sample more closely approximates a normal distribution. If the population distribution is normal, then the sampling distribution of the mean is also normal in shape. If the population distribution is not normal, then the sampling distribution of the mean becomes more nearly normal as sample size increases ('approximately normal') In reality, we'd only draw sample once and observe one sample mean x (i.e., 𝜎x is not calculated from various samples). According to CLT, we can use x to estimate µ with the standard error of the mean 𝜎x = (𝜎 ÷ √n) <img alt=\"5. Sampling Distribution of the Mean (One-Sample Z-Test).png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/5.-sampling-distribution-of-the-mean-(one-sample-z-test).png\" target=\"_self\"> CLT tells us the theoretical distribution of the sample mean x so we don't have to take hundreds of samples, find their mean and variance or create a histogram in order to use this information!\nWe can create a confidence interval (CI) for the mean: Rather than a point estimate for a population parameter, we can construct an interval estimate (i.e., the likely range capturing the population parameter). Hypothesis tests about the mean. So we can make a decision about a parameter based on sample data. Allow us to move from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics. Recall last time: Convert a data point x to z-score: z = (x - µ) ÷ 𝜎 Now, since sampling distribution of the mean follows a normal distribution: Mean: µx = µ Standard Error of the Mean: 𝜎x = 𝜎 ÷ √n To convert a sample mean x to z score: Z = (x - µ) ÷ 𝜎x = (x - µ) ÷ (𝜎 ÷ √n) Recall last time: In a recent census, the average income for several large rural counties was µ = $35,285 and the standard deviation was 𝜎 = $7,200. Now, suppose a sample of n = 400 households was randomly selected from this region. Describe the sample distribution of the mean. What is the probability that the average income from the sample is: Below $35,000?\nExceeding $39,000?\nBetween $35,000 and $35,500? According to CLT, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. Mean: µx = µ = $35,285 Standard Error of the Mean: 𝜎x = 𝜎 ÷ √n = $7,200 ÷ √400 = $360 Convert sample mean x to z score: z = (x - µ) ÷ 𝜎x = (x - 35285) ÷ 360. Or in one step: Z = (x - µ) ÷ (𝜎 ÷ √n) = (x - 35,285) ÷ (7,200 ÷ √400) Use z table to find the corresponding probability smaller than z.\nP (x &lt; $35,000) = P (z &lt; (35,000 - 35,285)÷360) = P (z &lt; -0.79) = 21.48%. P (x &lt; $39,000) = P (z &lt; (39,000 - 35,285)÷360) = P (z &gt; 10.32) = 1 - P (z &lt; 10.32) ≈ 0. It is extremely unlikely to observe a sample mean more than $39,000. P ($35,000 &lt; x &lt; $35,500) = P ((35,000 - 35,285) ÷ 360) &lt; z &lt; ((35,500 - 35,285) ÷ 360) = P (-0.79 &lt; z &lt; 0.60) = P (z &lt; 0.60) - P (z &lt; -0.79)\n0.7257 -0.2148 = 51.09% Given a confidence level 100 (1 - 𝛼)%, we can build an interval estimates for the population mean from sample mean (x). The most common confidence level is 95% (𝛼 = 0.05).\nReported as lower confidence limit (LCL) and upper confidence limit (UCL), aka lower confidence bound (LCB) and upper confidence bound (UCB).\nGeneral form: 100 (1 - 𝛼)&amp; CI = x ± za/2x 𝜎x (Recall 𝜎x = 𝜎 ÷ √n) 90% CI = x ± 2.645 x 𝜎x\n95% CI = x ± 1.96 x 𝜎x\n99% CI = x ± 2.575 x 𝜎x Interpretation: The confidence interval will contain the true population mean 100 (1 - 𝛼) out of 100 times. Here we define the area in the tails as 𝛼. Since we have 2 tails, each tail is 𝛼 ÷ 2 This is for nondirectional CI. For directional, no need to find 𝛼 ÷ 2. Notice the table entry is the area under the curve to the left of z (i.e., PR), not the tail. Recall last time: The average June daily high temperature in Ohio is 80˚F, with a standard deviation of 3 degrees. 95% of the time, June daily high temperature in Ohio fluctuates between 74˚F and 86˚F. µ ± 1.96 x 𝜎: 80 ± 1.96 = 80 ± 5.88 (74, 86) Now, if we take a random sample of 100 June daily high temperatures from different dates/locations in Ohio, what is the sampling distribution of the mean? What is the 95% confidence interval (CI)? According to CLT, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. Mean: µx = µ = 80 Standard Error of the Mean: 𝜎x = 𝜎 ÷ √n = 3 ÷ √100 = 0.3 95% CI: µ ± 1.96 x 𝜎x: 80 ± 1.96 x 0.3 = 80 ± 0.588 ≈ (79.4, 80.6) Interpretation: With 95% confidence (i.e., 95 out of 100 times), our interval (79.5˚F, 80.6˚F) covers Ohio's true average June daily high temperature. 90% CI: µ ± 1.645 x 𝜎x: 80 ± 1.645 x 0.3 = 80 ± 0.4935 ≈ (79.5, 80.5)\n99% CI: µ ± 2.575 x 𝜎x: 80 ± 2.575 x 0.3 = 80 ± 0.7725 ≈ (79.2, 80.8) Scores on a physical performance test for middle school students have been normed nationally for all students with a mean µ = 175 and a standard deviation 𝜎 = 12. We took a sample of n = 120 students in Ohio found that the sample mean x = 162. Ohio population might be different from national norm so x = 162 deviates from µ = 175. Suppose we'd like to estimate the population mean for Ohio based on this sample, what is the 95% confidence interval (CI)? Report the lower confidence limit (LCL) and the upper confidence limit (UCL). Population µ = 175, 𝜎 = 12, Ohio Sample x = 162, n = 120\n95% CI for Ohio population: x ± za ÷ 2 x 𝜎x; or in one step: x ± za ÷ 2 x 𝜎 ÷ √n\n162 ±1.96 x 12 ÷ √120 = 162 ± 2.147 = (159.853, 164.147) Interpretation: We can be 95% confident that our interval covers the true population mean for Ohio (i.e., 95 out of 100 times, this CI would contain the true value of mean for the population to which we are generalizing). But is Ohio mean 162 significantly different from 175 (i.e., is the Ohio population from which we drew our sample the same population used to create the national norm)? Observation: Since 175 falls outside of the 95% CI (159.853, 164.147) of Ohio mean, it is likely that Ohio population deviates from the national norm. Hypothesis testing is a decision-making process where two possible decisions are weighed in a statistical fashion. Hypotheses are written for each decision and then sample data are used to help make the decision.

There is no difference or a 'null' difference between the population and hypothesized means (statistical hypothesis, chance model). Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): The opposite of H0. The scientific hypothesis that the researcher believes the outcome of the study will be, based on previous research and theory (research hypothesis, your theory). Hypothesis testing in a nutshell: Compare sample statistics to hypothesized distribution. If the data evidence is extreme, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the event did not happen by chance. Instead, our theory is supported by data. Set up hypotheses based on the research question. Where does the sample/observed mean lie on the sampling distribution?\nGiven the confidence level 100 (1 - 𝛼)%, what is considered extreme evidence?\nCompared to the critical value is the sample mean extreme enough to be considered different from 𝜇0? Probability of Type I Error (what we want to avoid in decision making).\nDetermine how far the sample mean needs to be from the hypothesized mean in order to reject H0. Set by the researcher or discipline, but the most commonly used values in the behavioral sciences and education are: 𝛼 = .05 (wrong 5% of the time, 95% confidence level)\n𝛼 = .01 (wrong 1% of the time, 99% confidence interval) A statistician is a person whose lifetime ambition is to be wrong 5% of the time.

Set up null and alternative hypotheses. Calculate observed z-score from sample statistics. Recall: zobs = (x bar - 𝜇0) ÷ (𝜎 / √𝑛) Given confidence level and direction, find the critical z-score and region from table. Compare zobs to zcrit and reject H0 if zobs is in the critical region. Population 𝜇 = 175, 𝜎 = 12, Ohio sample x bar = 162, n = 120\nNondirectional (two-tailed) so the hypotheses are: H0: 𝜇 = 175\nH1: 𝜇 ≠ 175 Calculate observed z-score: zobs = (x bar - 𝜇0) ÷ (𝜎 / √𝑛)\n= (162-175) ÷ (12 / √120) ≈ -11.87 Since 𝛼 = .05 and two-tailed (each tail is 0.25), look for z with area .0250: zobs = -1.96 Critical (rejection) region: Reject H0 if zobs &lt; -1.96 (or zobs &gt; 1.96) Since zobs &lt; -1.96, reject H0, indicating Ohio mean (162) is significantly different from national mean (175). Same physical performance test normed nationally: 𝜇 = 175 and 𝜎 = 12. We now have a sample of n = 80 students from Colorado and found that the sample mean x bar = 177. Is it reasonable to assume that Colorado sample is drawn from the same national population? Test using 𝛼 = .05.\nPopulation 𝜇 = 175 (𝜇0), 𝜎 = 12, Colorado sample 𝑥 bar = 177, 𝑛 = 80 Nondirectional (two-tailed) so the hypotheses are: H0: 𝜇 = 175\nH1: 𝜇 ≠ 175 Calculate observed z-score: zobs = (x bar - 𝜇0) ÷ (𝜎 / √𝑛) (177−175) ÷ (12 ÷ √80) ≈ 1.49 Since 𝛼 = .05 and two-tailed (each tail is .025), look for z with area .9750: 𝑧𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 1.96 Critical (rejection) region: Reject H0 if 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 &gt; 1.96 (or 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠&lt; −1.96)\n• Since 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 &lt; 1.96, cannot reject H0, indicating Colorado sample comes from the same national norms. A high school has 49 seniors enrolled in a highly-ranked vocational program. The principal believes the mechanical ability of these seniors in the program is greater than their peers throughout the state. On a normed test of mechanical ability, the mean 𝜇 = 50 points with 𝜎 = 14 points. The sample average for the 49 seniors in the vocational program was found to be 53.4 points. At 𝛼 = .05, does the data support the principal’s claim?\nPopulation 𝜇 = 175 (𝜇0), 𝜎 = 12, our senior sample 𝑥 bar = 53.4, 𝑛 = 49\nDirectional (one-tailed) so the hypotheses are: H0: 𝜇 ≤ 50\nH1: 𝜇 &gt; 50 To test if sample mean is greater, stop if x bar &lt; 𝜇0 (impossible to be greater)\nCalculate observed z-score: zobs = (x bar - 𝜇0) ÷ (𝜎 / √𝑛) (53.4−50) ÷ (14 ÷ √49) ≈ 1.7 Since 𝛼 = .05 and two-tailed (each tail is .025), look for z with area .9500: 𝑧𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 1.645\nCritical (rejection) region: Reject H0 if 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 &gt; 1.645\nSince 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 &gt; 1.645, we can reject H0 so the data support the effectiveness of the program. Notice this test would have been non-significant if it was non-directional (𝑧𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 1.96). Reject H0 if 𝜇0 falls outside of the 100 (1 - 𝛼)% confidence interval. Two-tailed: CI (x bar ± z𝛼 ÷ 2 × (𝜎 ÷ √𝑛)) does not cover 𝜇0 One-tailed: Testing if x bar is greater: LCL (x bar - z𝛼 ÷ 2 × (𝜎 ÷ √𝑛)) above 𝜇0. Testing if x bar is smaller: UCL (x bar + z𝛼 ÷ 2 × (𝜎 ÷ √𝑛)) below 𝜇0. Physical Performance in Ohio (𝜇0 = 175, σ = 12, x bar = 162, n = 120): 95% CI: x bar ± z𝛼/2 × (𝜎 ÷ √𝑛) = 162 ± 1.96 × (12/√120) = (159.853, 164.147)\nSince 95% CI does not cover 175, we can reject H0 (Ohio mean is significantly different from national norm) Physical Performance in Colorado (𝜇0 = 175, σ = 12, x bar = 177, n = 80) 95% CI: x bar ± z𝛼/2 × (𝜎 ÷ √𝑛) = 177 ± 1.96 × (12/√80) = (174.370, 179.630)\nSince 95% CI does cover 175, we cannot reject H0 (No differences detected between Colorado mean and national) Vocational Program Example (𝜇0 = 50, σ = 14, x bar = 53.4, n = 49) 95% LCL: x bar ± z𝛼/2 × (𝜎 ÷ √𝑛) = 53.4 - 1.645 × (14/√50) = 50.11(159.853, 164.147)\nSince 95% LCL is greater than 50, we can reject H0 (Data supports the effectiveness of the program) Probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed. Visually, it is the area more extreme (same direction of critical region) than observed statistic. Therefore, comparing p-value to 𝛼 will reach the same conclusion as comparing observed and critical statistics. Reject H0 if p-value &lt; 𝛼 (i.e., sample stats in rejection region). 𝛼 is usually .05 (95% confidence level). Notice p-values remain the same for tests with different 𝛼 levels, but p-value from a non-directional (two-tailed) test is 2 times larger than pvalue from a directional (one-tailed) test. For extreme cases p-values can be very close to 0, but theoretically p-values cannot equal 0. Therefore, report p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)\nPhysical performance in Ohio: Look up 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 (-11.87) on z-table, p-value is very small! Since 𝑝 &lt; .001, reject H0 at 95% confidence level. (NEVER report 𝑝 = 0.) Physical performance in Colorado: Look up 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 (1.49) on z-table, p-value = 2 × (1 − .9319) = .1362 Since 𝑝 = .1362 (𝛼 &gt; .05), cannot reject H0 at 95% confidence level. Vocational program: Look up 𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑠 (1.70) on z-table, p-value = 1 − .9554 = .0446 Since 𝑝 = .0446 (&lt; .05), reject H0 at 95% confidence level. Notice this test would have been non-significant if it was non-directional (𝑝 = 2 × .0446 = .0892, which would have been greater than .05). The idea is to compare sample statistics (say x bar) to the theorized distribution (say z). Reject H0 if data (zobs) shows extreme evidence (zcrit determined by 𝛼 level, usually .05). Three ways to reject H0 (one-sample z-test): The confidence interval constructed based on x bar does not cover 𝜇0. zobs &gt; zcrit (or negative values, zobs &lt; zcrit)\np &lt; 𝛼 (usually .05) Hypothesis testing confirms if there is a significant effect (H0 rejected), but it does not tell us how large the effect is. The effect size tells us how large the effect is (i.e., how meaningful/practical the effect).\nDifferent statistics have been developed to report effect size for different statistical analysis. For one-sample z-test (population 𝜎 known), we use Cohen's d to report effect size. Cohen's d = (x bar - 𝜇0) ÷ (𝜎) (i.e., how many SD's the difference is)\nSize of Cohen's d (by convention): d = ± 0.2: Small effect\nd = ± 0.5: Medium effect\nd = ± 0.8: Large effect Online Calculator: <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default2.aspx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default2.aspx\" target=\"_self\">Cohen's D Effect Size Calculator for Z-Test</a> Physical performance in Ohio: d = (162 - 175) ÷ 12 = -1.083 (large) Physical Performance in Colorado: d = (177 - 175) ÷ 12 = 0.167 (small, recall test was non-significant) Vocational Program Example: d = (53.4 - 50) ÷ 14 = 0.243 (small) One-sample z-test is not available in SPSS menu, but there is a syntax available on YouTube by how2stats: <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjbL6nWEwA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjbL6nWEwA\" target=\"_self\">One sample z test - SPSS (Part1) - YouTube</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrNagh2qGz8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrNagh2qGz8\" target=\"_self\">One sample z test - SPSS (Part 2) - YouTube</a> Notice the reported p-value is based on a two-tailed test.

When sample size is large, sampling distribution of the mean is normal or approximately normal regardless of population distribution. How to interpret a 95% confidence interval? The interval covers the population (true) mean 95% of the time. What is a null hypothesis? Null hypothesis is saying that the intervention is not working. Says there is no statistical significance between two variables. Alternative hypothesis is the expected outcome researchers have theorized. Most of the time you want to reject the null hypothesis because there would be no statistical significance between variables (not statistically significant) What is the confidence level corresponding to a 0.05 alpha (Type I error) level? 95%\nType I error is falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. It should not happen a lot. How extreme our sample mean to make it not based on chance. You can only commit Type I error 5% of the time. It only allows <img alt=\"6.

Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30). In most research projects, population standard deviation (𝜎) are usually unknown. But we can use our sample to compute a sample standard deviation (s). So we are now estimating two population parameters: Population mean (µ) is being estimated by the sample mean (x bar).\nPopulation standard deviation (𝜎) is being estimated by the sample standard deviation (s). Recall standard error of the mean: 𝜎x bar = 𝜎 ÷ √n (𝜎 is known)\nNow we can estimate: 𝜎x bar = s ÷ √n. Recall for one-sample z-test: zobs = (x bar - µ0) ÷ (𝜎 ÷ √n) (𝜎 is known)\nNow it is estimated by: (x bar - µ0) ÷ (s ÷ √n) But is it still normally distributed?

What did the z-distribution say to the t-distribution?\nA: You may look like me but you are not normal. Non-directional (two-tailed): To test if mean where sample came from (µ) is significantly different from hypothesized mean (µ0). H0: µ = µ0 vs. H1: µ ≠ µ0 Alternatively in terms of mean difference: H0: µ - µ0 = 0 vs. H1: µ - µ0 ≠ 0 Directional (One-Tailed): H0: µ ≤ µ0 vs. H1: µ &gt; µ0\nH0: µ ≥ µ0 vs. H1: µ &lt; µ0 Reject H0 if tobs = (x bar - µ0) ÷ (s ÷ √n) falls into the critical region (determined by tcrit given the df) A t-table might be used to determine the critical values (tcrit) and rejection region. Different t-tables might be constructed differently.\nFor the t-tables used in class, table entries are positive t values, given specific (common) probabilities of the upper tail. (Symmetric so you can figure out negative t)\nLook for t value given the degrees of freedom (df = n - 1) and 𝜎 level (Area is 𝜎 ÷ 2 for two-tailed and 𝜎 for one-tailed) or confidence level (default is two-tailed)\nAt 𝜎 = 0.05 (95% confidence level), n = 30, two-tailed test, what is the t value? From the t-table, df = 30 - 1 = 29\nUpper tail is 0.025 (or 95% at the bottom)\nOn the t-table, t = 2.045. Recall z0.025 = 1.96, which agrees that a t-distribution has heavier tails than z-distribution. Theoretically, when sample size approaches infinity (∞), t equals z. However, t-table does not have all the possible sample sizes so we rely on SPSS (p-value reported). Consider the data we collected last time sample data of the prices of OSU students are willing to pay for Gardyn (aka, willingness to pay or WTP): n = 20 (Our class is small, but your samples are usually larger)\nx bar = 181.9\ns = 231.2 (This is bigger than the 𝜎, because we treated the class as population last time) Retail price is $899 with unknown population 𝜎 Research question: Is OSU's students' WTP (estimated by x bar) significantly different from the retail price (µ0 = 899) at 95% confidence level (i.e., should the company consider OSU students its target customers?)

Since the 95% CI does not cover 0, we can conclude that OSU students' WTP for Gardyn is significantly different from the retail price.\nFinally, the easiest way: Compare p-value to α (alpha, usually .05). Reject H0 if p &lt; α (alpha).\nAccording to SPSS (two-sided), our p-value is extremely small (p &lt; .001). When p-value is extremely small (very close to 0), we’d report p &lt; .001. NEVER report p = 0!\nOtherwise, report the observed p-value without the leading 0 (e.g., p = .003, p = .04, p = .52). •Since p &lt; α (.05), we can reject H0 and conclude that WTP for Gardyn is significantly different from the retail price. For one-sample t-test (population σ unknown), we use Cohen’s d to report effect size.\nCohen’s d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ s Recall Cohen’s d for one-sample z-test: d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ 𝜎 So, here sample SD (𝜎) is used to estimate 𝜎.\nNotice, unlike z or t scores, effect sizes are not affected by sample size Size of Cohen's d (by convention): Small effect: d = ± 0.2 Medium effect: d = ± 0.5 Large effect: d = ± 0.8 Cohen's d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ s = -717.1 ÷ 231.215 = -3.101 Large effect size (in reality, observing such a large effect size is highly unlikely!) SPSS also reports Hedges’s g: Cohen’s d appears to be biased for small samples (n &lt; 20). Hedge’s g serves as an unbiased estimator of the population effect size.\nHedges’s g ≈ d × {1 - (3 ÷ (4 × df - 1)}\nGardyn pricing example: Hedges’s g ≈ -3.101 × {1 - (3 ÷ (4 × 19 - 1)} = -2.977 <br><img alt=\"6.

The null hypothesis stated that WTP would not differ from the retail price. The alternative hypothesis stated that WTP would differ from the retail price.\nBased on a random sample of 20 OSU students, there was a mean WTP of $181.9 and a standard deviation of $231.215. Then compared against the hypothesized mean of $899, the one-sample t-test was statistically significant, t(19) = -13.87, p &lt; .001, indicating WTP is significantly different from $899.\nIn addition, the effect size Cohen’s d was -3.101, generally interpreted as a large effect (Cohen, 1988), indicating that there is about 3 standard deviations difference between WTP and retail price, with the WTP lower than the retail price. SPSS reports both one-sided and two-sided p-values, but only two-sided CI is reported. To obtain one-sided upper or lower confidence limits, run a test doubling the 𝛼 (alpha) level This doe snot affect the p-values reported in the output. Say if you are conducting a directional test a 95% confidence level and want to see LCL or UCL, you can change the confidence interval percentage from 95% to 90% in Options. The lower end of reported 90% CI would be 95% LCL (Lower Control Limit), and the upper end of reported 90% CI would be 95% (Upper Control Limit). Any variation detected inside the control limits probably occurred by chance. On the other hand, variation outside of the control limits likely occurred due to special causes. The upper control limit (UCL) and the&nbsp;lower control limit&nbsp;(LCL) serve as boundaries for expected deviation in data.\n<br><img alt=\"6.

The 6th question (p = .003) remain significant.\nCan also create more conservative CI’s: 100 (1 - α / m)%: 99.2% CI’s are wider than 95% CI’s, making them more likely to cover the test value (μ0). One-sample z-test and one-sample t-test are considered robust for violations of normal distribution (i.e., assumption can be violated without serious errors). CLT assures that, for a large sample, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal regardless of the shape of population.\nHowever, when sample size is very small (e.g., n &lt; 5), the test is not robust to non-normality. (Some studies also found the test is not as robust for one-tailed tests even with large samples). Non-normality can inflate the standard error of the mean, reduce power, and affect control of Type I error. Other non-parametric alternatives are available. They do not make assumptions on distribution.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Statistics/ESQREM-6641","#Lecture","#Statistics/T-Test"],"headers":[{"heading":"About Midterm","level":2,"id":"About_Midterm_0"},{"heading":"Top Hat","level":2,"id":"Top_Hat_0"},{"heading":"Last Time: One-Sample Z-Test","level":2,"id":"Last_Time_One-Sample_Z-Test_0"},{"heading":"Today: One-Sample T-Test","level":2,"id":"Today_One-Sample_T-Test_0"},{"heading":"Unknown 𝜎","level":3,"id":"Unknown_𝜎_0"},{"heading":"No...

For positive emotion change, the effect size (d = 1.106) is quite large. The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score.

If your t-test is one-tailed, you need to say so. It's preferred to report the exact p-value unless it's smaller than .001. You need to state your alpha level (usually .05) early in the results section. If your p-value is smaller than .001, it's conventional simply to state p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)\nRemember to drop the leading 0 from the p-value. No need to provide a formula for observed t in your paper. Observations are from a random sample, and the scores are independent of each other. Dependent variable of interest is measured on at least an interval scale. Difference scores (d's) are normally distributed. Typically considered robust to violations of non-normality, especially for big sample (n &gt; 30)\nIf one of the samples is highly skewed (particularly for a one-tailed test), a lot of error will tend to be built into the difference scores. Other non-parametric analyses would be better alternatives.

Group 1: Mobile (n1 = 22)\nGroup 2: In-Person (n2 = 31) Since the research interest is if mobile orders are smaller, I'll treat the mobile group as experiment (group 1 in SPSS for independent t-test) and in-person as control (group 2 in SPSS for independence t-test). Don't be confused with variable coding. For the variable order, value 1 = In-Person and value 2 = Mobile (nominal coding is interchangeable) DV is usually recorded as one variable. IV is usually recorded as another variable to identify groups (dichotomous, or pick 2 groups at a time to compare).\nAnalyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Independent-Samples t-test\nMove DV to Test Variable(s)\nMove IV to Grouping Variable and define groups (Group 1 and Group 2) If there are treatment and control groups, group 1 is usually treatment and group 2 is control. The mean difference is group 1 minus group 2. You can refer to the descriptive statistics to confirm which group is higher. AKA homoscedasticity\nWhen comparing means, we need the dispersion to be similar in both groups. The distortion in spread can interfere with our investigation of difference between means.\nHOV assumes population variances for the two groups are equal. If design is balanced (n1 = n2), no need to worry about departure from HOV (independent t-test is robust in this case).\nHOV tests are sensitive to violations of other assumptions about the data, especially normality. So there are many versions of this test: An easy way (by hand) is the F-max test (aka Hartley's F-max test).\nSPSS uses Levene's HOV test for independent t-test. This is the first time we do not reject the null hypothesis. F has two degrees of freedom\nH0: 𝜎12 = 𝜎22 vs. H0: 𝜎12 ≠ 𝜎22 Or alternatively, H0: 𝜎12 ÷ 𝜎22 = 1 vs. H0: 𝜎12 ÷ 𝜎22 ≠ 1 (whether the ratio of 2 variances equals 1) For convenience we generally put the larger variance in the numerator and smaller variance in the denominator, and the ratio follows an F-distribution: Fmax = (s2) (larger) ÷ (s2) (smaller) Fmax is compared to a critical F value. For this test, we hope to retain (cannot reject) H0 so HOV is tenable (satisfactory)! Small Fmax or big p-value are good (i.e., equal variances)! <br><img alt=\"8. Independent T-Test, Homogeneity of Variance.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/8.-independent-t-test,-homogeneity-of-variance.png\" target=\"_self\">\n<br><img alt=\"Densities of F-Distributions.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/educational-statistics-6641/key-terms-and-concepts/densities-of-f-distributions.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe F distribution is usually used to compare variances. Since variances are always a squared value and always non-negative, the F statistic does not go below 0, and it is not symmetric. The F-statistics has two sets of degrees of freedom: Numerator (v1) and denominator (v2). The pair of degrees of freedom determine the shape of the F distribution. When comparing two groups (sample sizes n1 and n2), v1 = n1 - 1 and ), v2 = n2 -1. If F-max test, v1 (dfnum) is the degree of freedom for group with larger variance, and v2 (dfdenom) is the degree of freedom for the group with smaller variance. Reject H0 if Fmax ≥ F (α, dfnum, dfdenom) but we don't want to reject it! Fmax = 375.225 ÷ 297.065 ≈ 1.263\nCritical F (. 05, 25, 21) = 2.045\nSince 1.263 &lt; 2.045, cannot reject H0\nFireworks spending for people living in the city has a variance comparable to that of in the country (HOV satisfactory)!

Just remember if we see a big p-value (p-value ≥ .05), HOV is tenable (satisfactory). If p-value is small (p &lt; .05), HOV is violated. The Welch's t-test (aka separate variances t-test, unequal variances t-test) is usually appropriate when the population variances are unequal and the sample sizes are unequal. [Optional] tobs = unstandardized b ÷ standard error\nVariance errors of the mean are computed for each group where s12 are sample variances for groups. The criteria to reject H0 are the same as independent t-test (extreme t or small p).\nWe'll let SPSS do Welch's t-test for us! Just remember if we see a small p-value (p &lt; .05), we can reject H0 and claim difference between the two group means is significantly different from 0 (or one-sided p-value to test greater/smaller).\nMake sure to report t, df, and p-value to support your conclusion. <br><img alt=\"8.

If the size of the standard deviation for one variable is reduced, everything else being equal, then the size of correlations with other variables will also be reduced. In other words, we need sufficient variation for a relationship to be evidenced through the correlation coefficient value.\nHS GPA and ACT example: The strength of correlation between GPA and ACT will be lessened if we only focus on the graduates with summa cum laude (weighted GPA 4.2 or above). Correlation means the variables are related in some way, but correlations alone should not be used to infer cause.

'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .2 (weak)\nr = ± .4 (moderate)\nr = ± .8 (strong)\nIt also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review). Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r: r = ± .1 (weak)\nr = ± .3 (moderate)\nr = ± .5 (strong) Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.\nStill a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. <br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href=\"Simple Linear Regression (SLR)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. You will learn regression models with multiple predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), in more advanced stats classes. Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y.

Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film. The statistician used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 100 movies rated by the Guide.\nRating: Maltin rating (range is 1 to 4, in steps of 0.5) Length: Running time (in minutes) Year: Year the movie was released Cast: Number of case members listed in the guide Origin: Country (0 = USA, 1 = International) Finding b0 and b1 (regression coefficients) for the regression line: <br><img alt=\"9.

Analyze -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear\nDefine DV and IV (one IV for SLR)\nUsually you'd already review descriptive statistics and correlations before running a regression, but you can also ask SPSS to report Descriptive in the Statistics option.

Omnibus: Comprising several items\n\"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package.\" The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question: Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV? Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=.05). General idea: Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)!

Behavioral and social scientists learn about phenomena by understanding how variables relate to each other.

The goal of statistical modeling is to make small changes to improve the model. Test if the new model reduces error (smaller SSE) compared to the previous model. If a more complex model predicts Y better (lower SSE), we conclude the added complexity (new predictor X) improved the model. The general linear model (GLM) is a way to simplify and combine multiple linear regression models into a single, unified format. It is not a different type of model but a more efficient way to represent them. General form: Y = XB + U\nData = Model + Error The key word is 'general.'\nThe GLM can be used to make predictions from various models. Depending on the outcome variable, logistic regression, ordinal regression, or count models (Poisson) may be used - these are also forms of the GLM.\nAnother term: Generalized Linear Models (GLIM) The GLM is actually a special case of (GLIM)!

Effect size computation by comparing the sum of squared total (SST) and SSE The simple model (i.e., mean-only model) is not very informative and has a lot of error. Y = 𝛽0 + 𝜀 Our model-building goal is to improve prediction and thereby reduce the error. To improve prediction and reduce error, we add a predictor variable (X) to the model. This enhanced model is the beginning of a 'predictive formula' that predicts individual outcome variable scores (Y) better than just predicting the mean. To use a bivariate regression model, identify two types of variables: <br><a data-href=\"Predictor\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Predictor</a>, or known variable (x)\n<br><a data-href=\"Outcome\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/outcome.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Outcome</a>, or to-be-predicted variable (y) Regression analysis provides an equation that corresponds to a line that best predicts y scores from x scores. <br>The model <a data-href=\"Population\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/population.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Population</a> <a data-href=\"Parameter\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/parameter.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Parameter</a> will be designated with a Greek letter (β). The estimate of the population parameter, which we calculate using our sample data, is designated by the Arabic letter b. We can predict a person's score on an outcome (dependent) variable (Y-Hat) based on what we know about that person's score on a predictor (independent) variable (x). If variables x and y are related to each other, then adding x to our model improves prediction and produces less error (SSE) than the simple model generated. Here we have two competing models: You can use bivariate regression to answer the following questions about the pattern of data points and the significance of a linear equation: Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?\nWhich equation of a straight line can best describe this pattern?\nAre the predictions made from this equation significant? More questions using Bivariate Regression: What is the nature of the relation between x and y?\nIs b statistically significant? What is the Confidence Interval for b. What is the effect size?\nHow is the y variance partitioned between explained and unexplained?\nDo plots of residuals indicate violations of assumptions for bivariate linear regression? The error produced by Model C is the most error a parametric model can have. Thus, we often call this model as the simplest or null model.\n<br>We call the sum of squared errors generated by Model C the <a data-href=\"Sum of Squares Total (SST)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sum of Squares Total (SST)</a>.\nWe call the sum of squared errors by Model A SSEA.

Centering the predictor of X to its mean can generate a better estimate because then the estimated 𝛽0 is now the predictor value of Y when the predictor X is its mean.

The first coding scheme that we will use is contrast coding. Using contrast codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnoses is coded -1 The advantage of using the contrast codes is when the groups have equal N, the numerical values assigned to each group will sum to zero. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The estimated intercept coefficient (𝛽0) is the grand mean of outcome, Depression symptom score We will use the previous example with depression score as an outcome and the diagnosis variable as a predictor. Depression = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1Diagnosis + 𝜀 Using Contrast Codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnosis coded -1.

By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the mean for the 0 group (No Diagnosis) and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the reference group (coded as 0) and the comparison group (Depressed).

From the previous augmented model (Model A) with a single predictor X, we will now have two predictors (X1 and X2) in Model A. This model comparison tests whether a model with two predictors (X1 and X2) is better than a model that just predicts the mean for every person. H0: 𝛽1 = 𝛽2 = 0\nIf the null hypothesis is not rejected, neither X1 nor X2 are related to Y. The multiple regression model is called the 'omnibus model' given that both regression coefficients of 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 are simultaneously estimated and tested. We will use the same example data for Y and X1 from the bivariate regression to analyze the multiple regression model with the new variable X2. State the compact Model C and an augmented Model A.

With bivariate regression, we easily calculated the regression coefficients (b0 and b1) by hand. We are not so lucky with multiple regression - or maybe we are very lucky, depending on your perspective.

Using contrast codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnoses is coded -1 The advantage of using the contrast codes is when the groups have equal N, the numerical values assigned to each group will sum to zero. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The estimated intercept coefficient (𝛽0) is the grand mean of outcome, Depression symptom score We will use the previous example with depression score as an outcome and the diagnosis variable as a predictor. Depression = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1Diagnosis + 𝜀 Using Contrast Codes For 2-category (binary) variable, one group is coded +1 and another group is coded -1 typically. Depressed are coded +1 and No Diagnosis coded -1. By doing so, the intercept coefficient represents the grand mean and the slope coefficient represents the difference between the grand mean and each group. The sum of the new Diagnosis variable is 0. The intercept coefficient represents the mean of outcome (Depression) when the predictor (Diagnosis) is 0, meaning that it is the mean for all subjects (grand mean).

Variance is a better measure of dispersion than range and IQR, because it takes into account all the values for a set of scores (but might be affected by extreme values). Conceptually, the variance is a measure of the area of the distribution (i.e., the more spread out the scores, the more area or space the distribution takes up). The sample mean might not be the same as the population mean (usually unknown), and the deviations would be affected. Therefore, sample variance obtained would be systematically too small. In order to get an unbiased sample estimate of the population variance, a slight change in the computational formula was made.

In hypothesis testing, a researcher's decision is based on a probability, depends on the level of significance for a hypothesis test, and can be to retain or reject the null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is also called significance testing. The criteria for a decision regarding the value stated in a null hypothesis is set by the level of significance. In hypothesis testing, a researcher can never prove that their hypothesis is correct. In Step 2 of hypothesis testing, researchers state a level of significance to minimize the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. The power of the decision-making process is the likelihood of rejecting a false null hypothesis. Effect Size allows researchers to describe a.) how far mean scores have shifted in the population or b.) the percentage of variance that can be explained by a given variable. A researcher reports that the size of an effect in some population is d = .88. What is an appropriate interpretation? Mean scores shifted .88 standard deviations in the population Increasing sample size will increase the power of the decision. The t-distribution is similar to the z-distribution except it is associated with greater variability, 'thicker' tails compared with the z-distribution, and is associated with scores being more likely in the tails of the distribution.

Matched Samples Design is a research design in which two or more groups of individuals are identical, or matching, in terms of the third variable.

Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis:<br>\n<img alt=\"Midterm 2-4.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-4.png\" target=\"_self\">\nWhere µ = group mean and k = number of groups. If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which is that there are at least two group means that are statistically significantly different from each other. The one-way ANOVA is an Omnibus test statistic, and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test. It is used to test research questions and hypotheses where you want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single dependent variable. You are asking if there is a significant difference between the groups based on a single categorical independent variable with multiple levels. <br><img alt=\"Midterm 2-8.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-8.png\" target=\"_self\">\n<br><img alt=\"Midterm 2-9.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-9.png\" target=\"_self\"> If you are dealing with individuals, you are likely to encounter this situation using two different types of study design: One study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then randomly split this group into three or more smaller groups (i.e., each participant is allocated to one, and only one, group). You then get each group to undertake different tests (or put them under different conditions) and measure the outcome/response on the same dependent variable. For example, a researcher wishes to know whether different pacing strategies affect the time to complete a marathon. The researcher randomly assigns a group of volunteers to either a group that (a) starts slow and then increases their speed, (b) starts fast and slows down or (c) runs at a steady pace throughout. The time to complete the marathon is the outcome (dependent) variable. <br><img alt=\"Midterm 2-5.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-5.png\" target=\"_self\"> A second study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then split them into groups based on some independent variable. Again, each individual will be assigned to one group only. This independent variable is sometimes called an attribute independent variable because you are splitting the group based on some attribute that they possess (e.g., their level of education; every individual has a level of education, even if it is 'none'). Each group is then measured on the same dependent variable having undergone the same task or condition (or none at all). For example, a researcher is interested in determining whether there are differences in leg strength between amateur, semi-professional and provessional rugby players. The force/strength measured on an isokinetic machine is the dependent variable. <br><img alt=\"Midterm 2-6.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-6.png\" target=\"_self\"> <br>Every time you conduct a t-test there is a chance that you will make a <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a>. This error is usually 5%. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of \"making a mistake\" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests. However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors. An ANOVA controls for these errors so that the <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a> remains at 5% and you can be more confident that any statistically significant result you find is not just running lots of tests.

When you choose to analyze your data using a one-way ANOVA, part of the process involves checking to make sure that the data you want to analyze can actually be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a one-way ANOVA if your data \"passes\" six assumptions that are required for a one-way ANOVA to give you a valid result. <br>Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (<a data-href=\"Interval Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Interval Variable</a> and <a data-href=\"Ratio Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ratio Variable</a>) (i.e., they are <a data-href=\"Continuous Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Continuous Variable</a>; IQ score, exam scores, weight, etc).\nThe dependent variable is normally distributed in each group that is being compared in the one-way ANOVA (technically, it is the residuals that need to be normally distributed, but the results will be the same). <br>For example, if we were comparing three groups (e.g., amateur, semi-professional, and professional rugby players) on their leg strength, their leg strength values (<a data-href=\"Dependent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dependent Variable</a>) would have to be normally distributed for the amateur group of players, normally distributed for the semi-professionals and normally distributed for the professional player. You can test for normality in SPSS. <br><a data-href=\"Testing for Normality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/testing-for-normality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Testing for Normality</a> <br>Your <a data-href=\"Independent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independent Variable</a> is <a data-href=\"Nominal Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/nominal-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nominal Variable</a>. There is homogeneity of variances. This means that the population variances in each group are equal. If you use SPSS Statistics, Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances is included in the output when you run a one-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics.

Typically, a one-way ANOVA is used when you have three or more categorical, independent groups, but it can be used for just two groups (but an <a data-href=\"Independent Samples T-Test\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independent Samples T-Test</a> <a data-href=\"Independent Samples T-Test\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independent Samples T-Test</a> is more commonly used for two groups)\nExample independent variables that meet this criterion include ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate, and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist) and so forth. <br>You should have <a data-href=\"Independence of Observations\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independence of Observations</a>, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. For example, there must be different participants in each group with no participant being in more than one group. This is more of a study design issue than something you can test for. If your study fails this assumption, you will need to use another statistical test instead of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., a repeated measures design). <br>If you are unsure whether your study meets this assumption, use <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://statistics.laerd.com/features-selecting-tests.php\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://statistics.laerd.com/features-selecting-tests.php\" target=\"_self\">Features - Statistical Test Selector | Laerd Statistics</a>. There should be no significant outliers. Outliers are simply data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern (e.g., in a study of 100 students' IQ scores, where the mean score was 108 with only a small variation between students, one student had a score of 156, which is very unusual, and may even put her in the top 1% of IQ scores globally). The problem with outliers is that they can have a negative effect on the one-way ANOVA, reducing the validity of your results. <br>Your <a data-href=\"Dependent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dependent Variable</a> should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the <a data-href=\"Independent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Independent Variable</a>. We talk about the one-way ANOVA only requiring approximately normal data because it is quite 'robust' to violations of normality, meaning that assumption can be a little violated and still provide valid results. You can test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which is easily tested for using SPSS Statistics.<br>\n<img alt=\"Midterm 2-20.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-20.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Midterm 2-21.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/statistics/midterm-2-21.png\" target=\"_self\"> <br>There needs to be <a data-href=\"Homogeneity of Variances\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/homogeneity-of-variances.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Homogeneity of Variances</a>. You can test this assumption in SPSS Statistics using Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If your data fails this assumption, you will need to not only carry out a Welch ANOVA instead of a one-way ANOVA, which you can do using SPSS Statistics, but also use a different post hoc test. Levene's test tells us if we have met the assumption that the two groups have approximately equal variances on the dependent variable. If Levene's Test is significant ('Sig.' is less than .05), the two variances are significantly different. If Levene's Test is not significant, then the two variances are approximately equal, and the assumption is met. <br>The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the <a data-href=\"Type I Errors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type I Errors</a> rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options: Transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed\nChoose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality. There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated. Welch\nBrown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you can run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most situations, it has been shown that the Welch test is the best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in SPSS. A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumptions to fail. Often, there is little you can do that offers a good solution to this problem.

Difference A one-way ANOVA was used to test for mean differences in science type depending on the intent to stay. It was predicted that there would be differences among the science types, though no specific group differences were made a priori. Assumptions of the one-way ANOVA were upheld. For example, data was generally normally distributed with histograms following a normal distribution curve and a significant Shapiro-Wilk’s test. Similarly, HOV was upheld via a significant F value (F (2, 27) = 4.467, p = .021). There was a statistically significant difference between groups as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 4.467, p = .021). No Difference A one-way ANOVA was used to test for mean differences in science type depending on the intent to stay. It was predicted that there would be differences among the science types, though no specific group differences were made a priori. Assumptions of the one-way ANOVA were upheld. For example, data was generally normally distributed with histograms following a normal distribution curve and a significant Shapiro-Wilk’s test. Similarly, HOV was upheld via a significant F value (F (1, 42) = .010, p = .086). The results of the omnibus test suggests that there not statistically significant mean level differences in science type depending on the intent to stay (F (1, 42) = .010, p = .086, R2 = .00). The small effect size suggests that 0% of the observed variance in the science type can be explained by the intent to stay. Report the result of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., 'There were no statistically significant differences between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 1.397, p = .15). Running a post hoc test is usually not warranted and should not be carried out. You need to report your results. You then need to follow-up the one-way ANOVA by running a post hoc test. You need to perform the same procedures as above, but add into your results section that this assumption was violated and you needed to run a Welch F test. ANOVA test tells you whether you have an overall difference between your groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups differed - post hoc tests do. Because post hoc tests are run to confirm where the differences occurred between groups, they should only be run when you have a shown an overall statistically significant difference in group means (i.e., a statistically significant one-way ANOVA result). Post hoc tests attempt to control the experiment-wise error rate (usually alpha = 0.05) in the same manner that the one-way ANOVA is used instead of multiple t-tests. Post hoc tests are termed a posteriori tests; that is, performed after the event (the event in this case being a study). There are a great number of different post hoc tests that you can use. However, you should only run one post hoc test - do not run multiple post hoc tests. For a one-way ANOVA, you will probably find that just two tests need to be considered. If your data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances, use Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. Note that if you use SPSS Statistics, Tukey's HSD test is simply referred to as 'Tukey' in the post post hoc multiple comparisons dialogue box. If your data did not meet the homogeneity fo variances assumption, you should consider running the Games Howell post hoc test. <br>Your <a data-href=\"Dependent Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dependent Variable</a> should be measured on a continuous scale (i.e., it is either an <a data-href=\"Interval Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Interval Variable</a> or <a data-href=\"Ratio Variable\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ratio Variable</a>).
