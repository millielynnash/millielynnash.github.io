Although the MFT common factors literature has grown, there are misconceptions and disagreements about their role in theory, practice, research, and training. This content analysis examined the contributions of the common factors paradigm to MFT theory, practice, research, and training over the past 20&nbsp;years. We identified 37 scholarly works including peer‐reviewed journal articles, books, and chapters. Using mixed methods content analysis, we analyze and synthesize the contributions of this literature in terms of theoretical development about therapeutic effectiveness in MFT, MFT training, research, and practice.

Common factors, rather than model-specific factors, are largely responsible for effective therapy. Despite increased theoretical and empirical support for common factors, there has been continued debate about their usefulness in the MFT field. The purpose of this content analysis is to critically analyze, synthesize, and clarify the contributions of the common factors paradigm to MFT theory, research, training, and practice. <br><a data-href=\"Common Factors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/common-factors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Common Factors</a> are an umbrella term for the general mechanisms or variables associated with therapeutic change that are common across therapy models. Common factors, also called general factors or mechanisms of change, are factors that contribute to change in psychotherapy. They are not the province of a specific model but instead are found in all therapies. Common factors are further defined as broad and narrow. Broad common factors include general aspects of treatment such as client and therapist factors, extra-therapeutic variables (e.g., foruitous events, social support), therapist-client relationship factors, and the client's expectancy of the success of therapy. Empirical support for common factors is grounded in outcome studies and meta-analyses of therapeutic effectiveness. Narrow common factors refer to aspects of treatment found in several models that go by different names. <br>Different models of therapy share common processes or goals, otherwise defined as <a data-href=\"Model-Dependent Common Factors\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Model-Dependent Common Factors</a>. These include shifting each partner's cognition, affect, or behavior; reattribution; reinforcement; desensitization; and psychoeducation and skills training. What are some examples of common factors in your own work with the various theories? How often do they overlap? The MFT field has traditionally conceptualized and explained therapeutic effectiveness through the lens of models. Therapy is effective because of the unique and particular philosophy or intervention of each therapeutic model. However, several meta-analyses of psychotherapy demonstrate this is not the care, finding no model of couple and family therapy consistently yielding better results than others. It is important to critically examine the impact, strengths, and limitations of this paradigm as applied to MFT theory and practice. What are the primary characteristics of common factors literature in the MFT field? What common factors are identified in the MFT literature?\nHow do common factors researchers draw distinctions between change mechanisms, change process, and common factors?\nHow do common factors contribute to the discussion about the therapeutic effectiveness of MFT?\nHow do MFT scholars explain the relationship between common factors and models?\nHow do common factors inform and enhance MFT practice, research, and training? How does the MFT common factors literature answer fundamental questions about therapeutic effectiveness and the process of change in therapy? We used the following criteria to determine whether to include works in our sample: Common factors are the primary focus of the work\nThe authors discuss common factors as applied to the practice of MFT\nThe work was published in a peer-reviewed journal or academic outlet between 1999 and early 2019. The authors have written about common factors extensively. Throughout the data analysis and discussion of the results, we met to discuss our position in relationship to common factors. We engaged in this process to acknowledge our position of support for common factors and our belief in their role as important aspects of therapeutic change; we also recognize there are significant limitations to the existing literature. Our aim was to provide a rigorous, honest, and critical commentary of the common factors literature in MFT, and we continually reminded ourselves of this aim throughout the analysis.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"A 20‐Year Review of Common Factors Research in Marriage and Family Therapy: A Mixed Methods Content Analysis","level":1,"id":"A_20‐Year_Review_of_Common_Factors_Research_in_Marriage_and_Family_Therapy_A_Mixed_Methods_Content_Analysis_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Introduction","level":3,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Background: Common Factors in MFT","level":3,"id":"Background_Common_Factors_in_MFT_0"},{"heading":"Definition of Common Factors","level":4,"id":"Definition_of_Common_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Common Factors Paradigm in MFT Literature","level":4,"id":"Common_Factors_Paradigm_in_MFT_Literature_0"},{"heading":"Study Scope and Purpose","level":3,"id":"Study_Scope_and_Purpose_0"},{"heading":"Quantitative","level":4,"id":"Quantitative_0"},{"heading":"Qualitative","level":4,"id":"Qualitative_0"},{"heading":"Mixed","level":4,"id":"Mixed_0"},{"heading":"Method","level":3,"id":"Method_0"},{"heading":"Selection Criteria and Selection","level":4,"id":"Selection_Criteria_and_Selection_0"},{"heading":"Researcher Reflexivity","level":4,"id":"Researcher_Reflexivity_0"},{"heading":"Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Data Analysis","level":4,"id":"Quantitative,_Qualitative,_and_Mixed_Data_Analysis_0"},{"heading":"Results","level":3,"id":"Results_0"},{"heading":"Qualitative Results","level":4,"id":"Qualitative_Results_0"}],"links":["glossary/cft-keywords/common-factors.html","glossary/cft-keywords/common-factors.html",".html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/advanced-research-methods-(hdfs-7780)/readings/@daniello20yearreview2020.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1726840818205,"modifiedTime":1726844248808,"sourceSize":14177,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Advanced Research Methods (HDFS 7780)/Readings/@daniello20YearReview2020.md","exportPath":"advanced-research-methods-(hdfs-7780)/readings/@daniello20yearreview2020.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"advanced-research-methods-(hdfs-7780)/readings/@potesystemicfamilytherapy2003.html":{"title":"@poteSystemicFamilyTherapy2003","icon":"","description":"\nBibliography:\nType: Journal Article\nTitle: Systemic family therapy can be manualized: research process and findings, Author: Pote, H.; Stratton, P.; Cottrell, D.; Shapiro, D.; Boston, P.; Journal: Journal of Family Therapy, Volume: 25,\nIssue: 3\nPages: 236-262\nYear: 2003 DOI: 10.1111/1467-6427.00247\nISSN: 0163-4445, 1467-6427\nDetermining the efficacy of therapeutic interventions is becoming an increasing political and ethical necessity. Comparative therapeutic outcome trials are most powerful when there is a precise specification, or manualization, of the forms that therapies took. Manuals have begun to be developed for structural/behavioral family therapy and couple therapy. The development of these manuals is often reliant on experts' self‐report, rather than a systematic analysis of the therapeutic process as it happens. This can limit their validity and applicability to standard clinical practice. In addition, no manuals exist which reflect less structured forms of family therapy aimed at incorporating systemic, postmodern and narrative frameworks. The feasibility of producing a workable manual that reflects the fluidity of such practices has been questioned. A research project to systematically create and test such a manual is reported. Multiple data sources and research methods, primarily qualitative, were applied to generate a rich specification of the therapy. In reporting these results the contents of various aspects of the final manual are indicated. Procedures to ensure that the prescribed practice is consistent with a widely used approach to systemic family therapy are also described. The manual will be an important tool for outcome research and therapeutic practice. The account of the research process should be helpful to researchers engaged in constructing a manual for other models of family therapy based on a rigorous analysis of actual practice. The manual itself is available for use by outcome researchers who wish to evaluate this widely used form of systemic family therapy.\nKeywords: Need to Read There has been a tendency for the more easily specified and measurable to be privileged. It has been a common strategy for manuals to be defined and specified anecdotally by senior practitioners. These practices in manual development and outcome research may risk the development of a 'biased' evidence base. Easily prescribable cognitive-behavior techniques applied to specific diagnostic categories have been manualized before more complex psychotherapeutic techniques with more general application. Have you experienced this in your clinical work? Have you struggled to find resources or anything to provide structure to your sessions? If some therapists have more manualized theories than others, does that create a difference in outcome for clients? Are we really systemic researchers if we are only observing the individual self-report data? Are there familial/relational measures looking at more than one person in the family? How much of our understanding is the individuals that make up the system or the interactions between them?\n\"The result is that therapists and researchers alike remain unclear about what constitutes effective family therapy.\"\n\"Examples of manuals detailing less structured, systemic family therapy are limited, since until recently the ethos of these forms of family therapy has worked against anything that might look like a prescription of what the therapist should do.\" But have we? Therapists were required to retrospectively rate their intentions in relation to the systemic practices they observed in videotape reviews of their own therapy practice. Ratings of 26 possible intentions were given on a five-point Likert scale relating to the extent to which therapists felt they were being guided by this intention during their practice. Manuals specify different modes of clinical practice and enable comparisons of model efficacy through controlled outcome trials. In order for the findings from outcome research to be clinically relevant and meaningful, the manuals used must offer a fair representation of practices within the contexts in which the therapy is usually delivered. Within the systemic manuals that currently exist, there has been a tendency for the more easily specified and measurable to be privileged. It has also been a common strategy for manuals to be defined and specified anecdotally by senior practitioners in the field, with less reliance on therapy process research from clinical contexts. These current practices in manual development and outcome research may risk the development of a 'biased' evidence base. Across psychotherapy, easily prescribable cognitive-behavior techniques applied to specific diagnostic categories have been manualized before more complex psychotherapeutic techniques with more general application. Within family therapy the strategy has resulted in more behaviorally oriented forms being manualized and shown to be effective for specific conditions. A common criticism of outcome research is of a lack of generalizability to everyday practice. Participants are unrepresentative, as they have usually been screened to exclude any with multiple difficulties; the therapy is delivered to a higher. Standard and in more tightly defined form than is possible in normal practice; and most evidence will have accumulated about older forms of therapy. More applicable research would be facilitated by the availability of a manual derived from representative current practice, in a format that allows for current developments and the emphases of clinics in which it would be implemented. It should also be designed to consider <a data-href=\"Second-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Second-Order Change</a> with the usual range and complexity of family difficulties. Family therapy is effective when compared with no treatment controls and, for some presenting difficulties, is more efficacious than individual interventions (e.g. marital distress, anorexia in young adolescents). Family therapy may also have advantages over individual treatments in relation to engagement and client ratings of satisfaction. Family therapy may also be more cost-effective than residential and inpatient treatments, but may not be sufficient in itself to address a variety of severe disorders and problems (e.g. schizophrenia, adolescents’ conduct difficulties).\nSystemic psychotherapy research is full of methodological flaws. Design issues, such as small and sometimes unrepresentative participant samples and the lack of credible no-treatment and alternative treatment controls, continue to undermine the conclusions of the research. It is easy to become lost in the multitude of definitions of what constitutes the family therapy interventions assessed, if, that is, the researchers have defined the interventions at all. The result is that therapists and researchers alike remain unclear about what constitutes effective family therapy. Examples of manuals detailing less structured, systemic family therapy are limited, since until recently the ethos of these forms of family therapy has worked against anything that might look like a prescription of what the therapist should do. The key stages in the research process Semi-structured interviews with five expert family therapists, with qualitative and quantitative analysis. Observational ratings of fifteen videotapes of expert family therapy sessions, using a specifically developed observational rating schedule and employing quantitative analysis. Development of a draft manual. Trial of the manual in practice by three experienced family therapists to obtain qualitative feedback and ascertain quantitative self-report of adherence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by the first author with five expert family therapists from LFTRC. An adapted version of the Brief Structured Recall (BSR) method was used to structure interviews. Therapists were required to retrospectively rate their intentions in relation to the systemic practices they observed in videotape reviews of their own therapy practice. The process used to elicit accounts of the kinds of therapeutic practice the therapists would report when confronted with samples of their own practice. Ratings of 26 possible intentions were given on a five-point Likert scale relating to the extent to which therapists felt they were being guided by this intention during their practice. Using the BSR method, therapists were also asked to comment on the theoretical ideas that were informing their practice. Through this recursive process the following guiding principles were produced: Systems Focus: In working systemically the central focus should be upon the system rather than the individual, particularly in relation to the difficulties and issues that the family system brings to therapy. Connections and Patterns: In understanding relationships and difficulties within systems it will be important for the therapist to consider the connections between circular patterns of behaviors within systems. This process of therapy should enable family members to consider these connections from new and/or different perspectives. <br><a data-href=\"Circular Causality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/circular-causality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Circular Causality</a> (Circularity): Patterns of behavior develop within systems, which are repetitive and circular in nature and also constantly evolving. <br><a data-href=\"Social Constructionism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Constructionism</a>: Meaning is created in the social interactions that take place between people and is thus context dependent and constantly changing. The negotiation of a shared meaning, constructed afresh in each conversation, takes precedence over the concept of a single external reality. Strengths and Solutions: the therapist should take a non-pathologizing, positive view of the family system, and the current difficulties they are struggling with. The therapist should attend to the strengths and solutions in the stories that the family system brings to therapy. Cultural Context: The therapist should consider the importance of context, in relation to the cultural meanings and narratives within which people live their lives, including issues of race, gender, disability, religion, and class. The relationship between these narratives, the therapeutic relationship and its context, as well as the wider context for the therapeutic team and the family, should be an important consideration at the point of referral and throughout the therapy. Co-Constructed Practice: In therapeutic interactions reality is co-constructed between the therapist (and team) and the people with whom they meet. Reflexivity: Therapists should aim to apply systemic thinking to themselves and thus reject any thinking about families and their processes that does not also apply to therapists and therapy. In order to use self-reflexivity it will be necessary for therapists to be alert to their own constructions, functioning, and prejudices. Narratives and Language: behaviors and beliefs form the basis of stories or narratives, which are constructed by, around, and between individuals and the system itself. The language that is used to describe these narratives and the interactions between individuals construct the reality of their every day lives. <br><a data-href=\"Power\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/power.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Power</a>: The therapist should take a reflexive stance in relation to the power differentials that exist within the therapeutic relationship, and within the family relationships. <br><a data-href=\"Constructivism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/constructivism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Constructivism</a>: The idea that each person constitutes an autonomous meaning system and will interpret and make sense of information from this frame of reference. The systemic family therapy methods outlined through this process were: Teamwork, including the use of a designated ‘secretary’ from the therapy team to communicate with the family pre-therapy; Communications between the therapist, team and family through earbugs and telephones; Structuring sessions and feedback from the team through breaks and reflecting team discussions; Videotaping therapy sessions; Consultations to the wider system before and during therapy; Use of reading seminars to develop team thinking. Systemic family therapy techniques were more varied, with nineteen classifications including circular questioning, externalizing the problem, tracking life events and paying attention to language used. The categories were simplified for the purposes of a coding system, and the final categories were grouped into four sections: Therapist’s intention – the intervention that the therapist was observed to be attempting to implement, for example, reframing.\nFamily trigger event – the immediate actions of a family member before the therapist event, for example, talking about the problem.\nTherapist techniques – the type of therapist event, for example, the use of a statement or circular question.\nContent of the discussion – the overall theme of the therapist and family interaction for each therapist speech act, for example, talking about solutions. Findings showed that therapists used different types of technique according to the kind of intervention they were intending to achieve. <br>The technique which therapists used most frequenrly was asking linear questions, though they often used these in a circular fashion, moving around the family to vuild up a picture of events from everyone's persepctive.

Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research is the best resource to address the day-to-day questions that researchers have as they investigate couples and families, and the best source for learning long-term theory and methodology. The contributors of this volume share their wisdom on a wide variety of topics including validity concerns, measuring interpersonal process and relational change, dyadic data analysis (demonstrated through a sample research study), mixed methods studies, and recruitment and retention. The volume contains one of the most detailed descriptions of data collections and covers interviewing, using questionnaires, and observing brain activity.&nbsp; Also addressed are suggestions to meaningfully reduce cultural bias, to conduct ethical research, and, in the Health Services Research chapter, to examine interventions for clients in various income brackets. A separate, ground-breaking chapter also addresses psychophysiological research in a couple and family therapeutic context. As an added benefit, readers will learn how to become informed consumers of journal articles and studies, how to produce quality, publishable research, and how to write fundable grant proposals. Each chapter provides a clear and detailed guide for students, researchers, and professionals, and as a whole Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research advances the field by teaching readers how to provide evidence that marriage and family therapy not only relieves symptoms, but also effects behavioral change in all family members. Few studies have included information about how other members of the system change in relation to a single individual. The more traditional forms of statstical methods do not allow for multiple members of the same system to be included in the same analysis.

This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage). Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)\nWith respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).\nWhile the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible).

Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son. Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. Family members have a long history and a future together. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).\nWe need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems. Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts) For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

The goal of therapy shifted from interrupting problematic patterns of interaction to helping clients find new perspective on their lives. When they said reality was constructed, they meant socially constructed. Interpretations are shaped by our context. Interpretation of our experience mediates behavior. Social constructionists place more emphasis on the intersubjective influence of language and culture. Therapy becomes a process of deconstruction, freeing clients from the tyranny of entrenched beliefs. Inherent in most forms of therapy is the idea that before you can solve a problem, you must figure out what is wrong. But solution-focused turns this assumption on its head. The best way to solve problems is to discover what people do when they are not having the problem. Exceptions to a complaint. Therapists create a shift in their clients' experience by helping them reexamine how they look at things. <br><a data-href=\"Externalization\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/externalization.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Externalization</a>: Redefining problems not as properties of the individuals who suffer them, but as alien oppressors. The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. Structure became the target of change. Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems. Then, therapists aimed their interventions at those underlying beliefs. More recently, it dawned on therapists that those belief systems do not arise in a vacuum Behavior is shaped by transactions we don't always see.

Listen to the description of the problem and identify all members of the family, household, and others who might be involved. Establish connection and engagement. Ask how the problem is affecting other members of the family. You'd like to hear from everyone, at least initially, in order to get as much information as possible. Reminder calls help increase likelihood of attendance. Build alliance with the family. Develop hypothesis about what is maintaining the presenting problem.\nEstablish rapport.\nGather information.\nIntroduce yourself.\nOrient the family to the therapy room (physical or virtual) and the format of sessions.

What is keeping the family stuck?\nShare recommendations for treatment. What is maintaining the problem?\nMaintain therapeutic alliance. Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?\nChallenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. Listen to people's feelings. Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. Step back and observe. When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. Stay calm: You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. Be curious. Display empathy and respect. Review the therapeutic relationship. Say goodbye. Reinforce progress. Review what the family has accomplished. Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges.

Assess for substance use, IPV, and affairs. Consider assessment tools if needed.\nBe aware of mandated reporting. General Practitioner What is your scope of practice? Specialist Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems? Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. All behavior makes sense in context. No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. Family therapists work to see the big picture. Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. Share the following assumptions: A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. Systems theory Systems metaphor\nA family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. Social constructionist Textual metaphor\nPeople narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. Skeptical of objective reality.\nReality is constructed. Reality is constructed through language. Reality is negotiated through relationships. Shared meanings coordinate social action. Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. Therapist assumes expert role. Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. Humans are essentially good. All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).\nA supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. <br>Examples such as <a data-href=\"Carl Whitaker\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href=\"Virginia Satir\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Virginia Satir</a> One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication.

Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).\nIf the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

Believed in using the resources of his clients and designing a 'strategy for each specific problem'\nHe did not care about perspective (insight) as long as their actions produced beneficial results. Conducted therapy by paying extreme attention to details of the symptoms his clients presented. In therapy: Accepted and emphasized positive\nUsed indirect and ambiguously worded directives\nDirected routine behaviors so that the resistance is shown through change and not through normal continuous actions.

Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people. Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. People are always communicating. All behavior is communicative. One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions Report = Content = information = (What is said)\nCommand = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life\nBSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.\nOften see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions Go slow\nEngage in behavior they want to eliminate What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. <br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. <br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a> loop.

Centerpiece of the model\nFamilies encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it.

This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. What often needs to happen?

Structural: Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies. Functional: Problems result when people try to protect or control one another covertly, so that their symptoms serve a function for the system. Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. The job is simply to get the family moving again.\nHelp families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. In pushing family members to set concrete goals, they are forced to clarify vague dissatisfactions. The primary goal is behavior change. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. <br><a data-href=\"Mental Research Institute (MRI)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. <br><a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a>: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around) Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. Define a resolvable complaint. Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. Who sees it as a problem?\nWhy is it a problem now? \"What is the problem that brings you here today?\" is too vague. Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. The solution is part of the problem.\nPrescribe some alternative behavior!\nThe key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. MRI Approach: Introduction to the treatment setup\nInquiry and definition of the problem\nEstimation of the behavior maintaining the problem\nSetting goals for treatment\nSelecting and making behavioral interventions\nTermination Attempted solutions: The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories: When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT\nWhen clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING\nWhen clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. Paradoxical interventions: The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s). Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. Restraining technique: Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different. Co-founded the Family Therapy Institute of Washington D.C.

Problem Stage: Definition of the problem in clear behavioral terms\nAsk each individual for their perspective, speak to the less involved parent/partner first to get their involvement, listen carefully to the way each family member describes the problem, make sure no one interrupts until each has a turn, make observations. Emphasize the use of directives.\nIf therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. Interaction Stage: Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem\nEncourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another? Goal Setting Stage Providing directives\nGive the family a task, directives Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. \"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation.\" For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: \"Who makes you depressed?\"\n\"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?\" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. Example: A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent.

Changes in behavior alter perceptions. Milan group was interested in getting families to see things differently through (reframe) positive connotation. Which then gets family members to behave differently. Shift from behavior to cognition set stage for constructivist/narrative movements. Families should have clear generational boundaries. Therapists should be 'neutral' and not have expectations for families. Therapy helps the family by simply examining the family, asking questions to help them examine their own family structure, and exposing games after which they can redesign their family into a better structure on their own. <br><a data-href=\"Mara Selvini Palazzoli\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/mara-selvini-palazzoli.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mara Selvini Palazzoli</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Gianfranco Cecchin\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/gianfranco-cecchin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gianfranco Cecchin</a> Presession: Generate initial hypothesis of presenting problem.

Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. Set minimum goals for change. Investigate solutions to the complaints. Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'\nUnderstand clients' preferred views. Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'\nNurture and solidify initial change. Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)\nTherapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)\nCo-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)\nLate in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?\nI don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. Define a resolvable complaint. Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint Who is doing what?\nIf I had a video of this, what would I see? Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?\nDetermine a minimum change goal What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem: What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?\nWhat happens after these attempted solutions? Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like: What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution? The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions: How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?\nWhat do they hold near and dear?\nWhen are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?\nWhat is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?\nWhose idea was it to come? Why now?\nWho is most optimistic that therapy will help? How will you know the situation is improving?\nWhat kinds of change will you settle for?\nWhat will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?\nWhat will each of you settle for? Therapeutic restraint: Telling clients to 'go slow'\nCautioning them about the dangers of improvement\nGiving insturctions about how to make the problem worse Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. Identify problem-solution feedback loops: Demand-Refuse\nDiscuss-Acoid\nCriticize-Defend\nAccuse-Deny Encourage the family to do less of the same: When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. <br><a data-href=\"Reframing\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reframing</a>: For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. Acknowledging (Reinforcing): When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. Predicting or Prescribing: Exploring the dangers of movement. Therapeutic restraint / going slow\nPrescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting\nJamming / experiment\nReframing\nLess of the same\nAcknowledge / reinforce Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on: Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing. Applicable to any family that presents with a clear complaint. Particularly relevant for families that seem resistance to change.

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. <br>The three major concepts of structural family therapy are <a data-href=\"Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Structure</a>, <a data-href=\"Boundaries\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundaries</a>, and <a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a>s. <br><a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a> (Couple; Parent; Sibling) Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).\nThe focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers'\nOrganization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple\nParental\nChild/Sibling Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.\nDisengaged systems are independent, but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support. Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.\nEnmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness can cripple initiative. Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. \"The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system.\"\nDisengaged or enmeshed subsystems\nHierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary\nConflict avoidance Detouring which results in a scapegoat\nCross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted) Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).\nFamilies are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of: Normative life cycle transition The arrival of a first child\nAn adult child leaving home An acute stressor Natural Disaster\nUnemployment Single Adult\nCoupling\nHaving Children\nFamilies with Young Children\nFamilies with School-Age Children\nFamilies with Adolescents\nDivorce\nBlended Families\nLaunching Children\nLater Life Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. All behavior makes sense in context. The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other. <br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> refers to those moments in therapy when family members interact directly with each other. <br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> is not necessarily a technique. It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session. Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.\nProblems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.\nActivate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. Create effective hierarchy: Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).\n<br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> s reveal structural patterns and later change them. Take-Away: Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including: Who should attend\nHow often\nReferrals for psychiatric evaluation Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)\nMap the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)\nIntervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment) Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. Some problems may be treated individually. Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals.

Although structural family therapy begins with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be held with individuals or subgroups to strengthen boundaries. Asking family members to change seats. Asking family members to move seats further apart or closer together or turn toward one another. Having separate sessions with individuals or subsystems to strengthen boundaries.

The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem.

Act as a teacher, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Stroke and a Kick: To mother, \"You are very helpful.\" (Stroke)\nTo daughter, \"Mommy sometimes takes away your voice. Can you speak for yourself?\" (Kick) After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)\nTo formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. Should take into account every member. Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. Should not be explained to the family. As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. Use family's language. Use family's content. Include everyone. Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. Realize that there is no perfect reframe. Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. Blocking: Stopping usual transactions. Exaggerating: Encouraging or sustaining interactions. Silence: When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD) Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions) Therapist must be more flexible than the family. Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).\n<br><a data-href=\"Salvador Minuchin\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/salvador-minuchin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Salvador Minuchin</a> encouraged new therapists to reflect on aspects of their personal and relational lives that shape their therapeutic process and client behavior in session. Describe 'who you are' as a therapist. How will 'who you are' as a therapist impact therapy with families?\nWhat are your personal strengths? What are your growth areas? Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recently, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Similar to all family therapy approaches, structural family therapy is not effective in all cases. No research identifies readily observable characteristics shared by failed cases of structural family therapy. Developed to work with poor urban families, at all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and across countries. Indirect empirical support, as research on efficacy has focused on applicability to family treatment. Studies that directly test structural family therapy's efficacy in the treatment of various presenting problems and targeted populations are needed. Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'\nEffectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'\nCurrently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches. Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'\nInsufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)\nEffective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models. It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works: Randomized control trials\nCase studies data\nObservations of therapists and clients Collecting qualitative or quantitative Remember: Research lags behind practice in family therapy. Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. Heteronormative\nPathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)\nFamily mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances.

Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. Behavior is maintained by its consequences.\nConsequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers. Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)\nCBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. Deficits in communication and problem solving. High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members) Behavior is maintained by its consequences. Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)\nGood relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)\nEmotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)\nUnderstand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.\nUncovering hidden/automatic assumptions that keep people stuck. Overgeneralizations\nMagnification and minimization\nPersonalization\nDichotomous thinking\nLabeling and mislabeling\nAlso called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of\nThe therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. This agenda of therapy is educational: Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Identify behavioral goals\nLearn techniques to achieve these goals\nFacilitate social reinforcement of change Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)\nUse of homework assignments\nPhase out therapy gradually. Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. Booster sessions Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems: All couples run into conflict. Conflict resolution is a critical skill. Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. Families need problem solving skills Therapy includes: Clinical interview\nRating specific behaviors\nRelationship satisfaction questionnaires Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. Couples are helped to improve their communication.

Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. Do not be triangulated! CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'\nBlocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary Inclusion of other individuals if necessary\nMedication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT\nCo-therapy model is allowed\nBoth individual and conjoint sessions are allowed.

If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Once you know what works, do more of it. If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).\nFocus is on solutions, on what works for clients. Respect clients own resources. Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. Future-oriented\nFocusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).\nThe task of therapy is to do something different. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen? The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'\nSolution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. What brings you in?\nWhat are your best hopes for this meeting? Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. Changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. Problem talk: Negative\nFocuses on the past\nImplies permanence of problems. Clients are experts in their own lives. Clients know what they need Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?\nThe therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. People are resourceful. Problems are normal life-cycle complications. Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. What will you be doing instead? The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems – effective solutions already in their repertoire.\nChanging the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.\nAs the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.\nIt is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.\nGetting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.\nChange perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. They begin living in the solution, not the problem. The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. Time limited\nSessions are made one at a time\nOne may be enough\nTypical course includes 3-5 sessions\nClients can return as-needed\nOften a week to a few weeks apart\nOnce you know more of what works, do more of it Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. What do you think the problem is now?\nHow will you know when the problem is solved?\nHow will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?\nWhat will have to be different about others involved in the situation?\nWhat is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). Asks more about perceptions than feelings. Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.\nConsultant\nGuardian of the conversation\nDon't get bogged down in 'problem talk'\nFocus on what is right\nDirect clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. Focus on the 'here and now'\nThe future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. Assumes a position of 'not knowing.' What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?\nWhat needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?\nOften in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?\nConstructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal.

This study examined changes in couples' communication over the course of IBCT and TBCT. Early, middle, and late sessions were coded to measure couples' communication of acceptance. Results showed that IBCT couples expressed more nonblaming descriptions of problems and more soft emotions than TBCT couples during late stages of therapy. IBCT couples significantly increased their nonblaming description of problems and significantly decreased their expressions of hard emotions and their problematic communication over time. Results support the hypothesis that structural differences between the therapies affect initial levels of emotional expression in session.

The goal of the assessment is to get a baseline of the behavior so that you can quantify change. Functional Analysis of Behavior: Once the problem behavior is identified, then the antecedents and consequences surrounding the behavior are explored. (stimuli, organismic variables, target behavior/response, consequences, contingencies).\nReport the assessment to the family. Intervene in the pattern. Step 1: Induction (teach the lingo)\nStep 2: Demonstration (show them how it works)\nStep 3: Implementation (contingency contracts, time-out, star charts, marble game, etc.) Generalization: The goal is that this training will be generalized to other behaviors, but booster sessions are also helpful. Alexander and Parsons (1982) created for troubled adolescents and their families. Incorporates cognitive aspects and takes a more systemic approach, while the goal is behavioral change. Integrates three perspectives: Ecological\nLearning Theory\nCognitive\nTwo Phases of Treatment Therapy: Designed to modify attitudes, assumptions, expectations, labels and emotions of the family. The major focus is to relabel (reframe) the problem behavior into something positive. Education: Help family behave differently in conjunction with reattributions. Resistance to treatment is considered an impediment to change. It is a natural consequence of the inappropriate application of technology and failure of the clinician to understand the meaning of the behavior. Functional Family Therapy relabels behaviors to reduce resistance and to motivate change by providing reattributions for the causes of family members' behaviors. Change in meaning is a necessary precursor to behavior change. The relabeling (reframe, positive connotation, etc.) operates at three levels: Interactional Level: Benign description of the interpersonal impact of the behavior (distance regulation) Motivational Level: Recasts the motive for the behavior in a benign light. Systemic Level: Emphasizes the similarities between people, a family theme. If the reframe works it interrupts automatic processing, interrupts the behaviors that follow from this processing, and thus, changes the contingencies around the problem behavior. Functional Family Therapy emphasizes paying attention to the interpersonal functions of behaviors: Functions: A person's pattern of behaviors, feelings, and thoughts mediate amounts of psychological relatedness in a relationship with another person (distance regulation)\nThe expression of the function can be labeled good, bad, or neutral, the function itself is not judged. These functions are properties of relationships not traits. Linear Thinking: Cognitive processes need to be incorporated, although some would argue that they were never eliminated in the first place (i.e. cognition is a behavior). Meanings of behaviors, attribution processes, belief sets, automatic thinking can get in the way of contingency change. Unit of analysis tends to be the dyad: Behavior therapists have moved toward more contextual assessments, but each move out focuses on the one to one relationship rather than the system as a whole. Dependency on the therapist? Therapist teaches the model. Based on postivism Not postmodern, it is modern. Politics of behavioral couple therapy, acceptance. <br>Same process as parent training.

Major Goals: Increase positive control while decreasing aversive control. Improve communication, which should facilitate future problem solving. Interventions: Active listening with behavioral descriptions of the problem\nTeach new behavior exchanges\nEncourage couple to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and decision making. Teach strategies for future problem solving Techniques: Caring Days Make a list of what your partner could do to make you feel cared for. The partner does not need to do anything in return. Do not include sex as it can be seen as coercion. Quid Pro Quo Contracts Not very common because we get into the standstill of 'they have to do it first' Good Faith Contracts Both partners engage in those behaviors whether their partner does or does not. Politics and Power Politics of Behavioral Couple Therapy (i.e. Jacobson) Jacobson saw the issue with classic BMT as a problem with power, who gets to say what needs to change?\nIBCT was developed from these concerns, the focus shifted to acceptance and forgiveness.

Difficulties that lead to consultations with a family therapist often arise out of conflict within the family's own relationships.\"\n\"The family script can provide routines for family life which can be followed almost automatically.\"\n\"Repetition becomes the background against which change is the foreground, that which is new becomes the focus of attention. In contrast, chaos obscures potentially significant change, unless the new behavior facilitates consistency, in which case that new patter becomes the foreground, thus becoming the new center of attention.\"\n\"Rewriting family scripts follows the sequence of a scripted pattern giving way to some improvisation followed by the establishment of a new pattern.\"\n\"Family scripts can be defined as the family's shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.\" The term 'expectations' implies anticipation of what is to be said and done within family relationships, as well as family pressures to perform the roles as expected. If one member fails to perform in the prescribed way, another member of the family may be recruited to take up that role instead. The plot is 'scripted' while the cast can change. Family scripts are revealed when repeating patterns of family interaction are either observed or described.\nFamily Scenario: An encounter of which it can be said that something significant happens within family relationships. Basic elements of family scenario: Context Families engaging with each other around a particular task or situation Plot Family members 'motives' become clear as the scenario unfolds Outcome The consequences of the encounter are revealed The expected scenarios for each particular family situation thread together to create an overall script for how all family relationships are expected to be conducted in general. \"Problem Scenarios\": Instead called 'Attempted Solution Scenarios' This helps us to focus attention on how each person tries to solve the problem. The behavior that is experienced now as problematic may have started out as an attempted solution to an earlier problem. The co-constructed story may then become part of the family beliefs about what to expect of itself. Improvising implies abandoning the set script and extemporizing instead. This may happen when the old script does not fit the current situation, or when those involved are in sear of something different.\nThe therapist can help to create a new co-constructed scenario by suggesting a goal which the family then achieves in their own way. Suggest a scenario in which it becomes necessary for the family to improvise. (in two parent families, the parents should devise a strategy together)\nTry to block each move that has not worked in the past. Unraveling some of the origins of the scripted scenarios frees families to explore new pathways. Work on the present and the past can reinforce each other. Replicated Scripts Parents with their own individual scenarios from childhood that are repeated Corrective Scripts Choice of the opposite style of parenting Improvised scripts Corrective scripts repeated over time The therapist's background also plays a part in shaping scenarios in therapy. Positive Labeling Can be given to replicative scrips by labeling them as being loyal to the family of origin. Corrective scripts can be given a positive frame by pointing out to parents that they are struggling to provide a better experience for their children than their parents were able to provide for them. Improvised scripts (unlike the historical replicative and corrective scripts) are written in response to current situations. They are improvised either out of necessity or driven by curiosity and a wish to explore new ways of relating. A stimulus for improvisation is a degree of uncertainty about what to do next so that interaction must be played off the cuff. Positive comments can be made about how much the family is exploring unknown territory. Attachment behavior The behavior of a person seeking proximity to his or her attachment figure in a potentially dangerous situation. (This is a mechanism that protects children - or adults - when vulnerable)\nThe child uses the parent as a safe base from which to explore, and parent and child stay in contact to ensure that they can get together in the presence of any potential danger. In terms of script theory a potentially threatening situation evokes tightly scripted behavior in which parent and child predictably got together. Exploration allows for more improvisation. The therapist can become a temporary attachment figure to the family. The therapist must be aware of the factors that threaten the family's relationship. Any new behavior of uncertain origin emerging in a relationship (e.g., unexplained impatience) might be seen as either strange and treated as potentially dangerous, or novel and will arouse curiosity. If it is perceived as strange, attempts may be made to avoid reprovoking the impatience, returning to old familiar ways instead. If the impatience arouses curiosity, then it will probably lead to trying to discover what it is all about, and to improvise ways of dealing with it. If it becomes clear that the impatience poses a problem and something has to be done about it, new solutions may be improvised out of the necessity to sort things out. There are two main forms of improvisation in family relationships: Improvisation that comes out of necessity (Something has to be done when old solutions are not working)\nImprovisation out of curiosity when it feels safe to try something new, even if it is uncertain where it will lead. A therapist who is trusted by the family can make the risks involved in improvisation feel less frightening, even when family relationships are insecure.

Psychoanalytic Models of Family Therapy","icon":"","description":"\nMost psychoanalytic models are based on Freud's idea around the identity, ego and super ego, or the development of self. For Freud the drives were sexual (in terms of possession and control), for newer psychoanalytic ideas the drives are more around connection and validation of the self (good or bad).\nObject Relations Theory in some ways provides a bridge between psychodynamic theory and systems theory. We relate to people in the present based on expectations formed by early experience. Normal Development (?) Early development is based on attachment theory/separation-individuation constructs. Infant is born ready to be in a reciprocal relationship. This is activated by relating to a parent, by being loved and loving. Stages of development based on object relations: internal object (mental image of self and other, and self in relation to other). Objectless (primary narcissism/autistic) there is no other, only self. The following stages focus on the development of self through relations with internal and external objects: first the actual interactions and then the unconscious residue of the interactions. As humans, we exist in the context of relationships not as single units: There is no self without an object, there is no object without a self. Infants develop in a context of concentric 'holding environments.' As infants internalize the guarding, protecting, soothing and nurture of this 'holding environment' they begin to form a self (even if the environment is inadequate).\nThese early experiences then form our 'unconscious' drives for connection or separation. 'Real' others are 'used' to satisfy those drives, and we find others to validate our sense of self (good or bad). Health: achieving and preserving psychic wholeness through good object relations, integrating our 'unconscious' with our consciousness. Self and its relationships with others rest on and are expressed by the degree to which relations between the self and object are gratifying (but some theorists would suggest that since we are so narcissistic in the beginning, the relationships with others are never gratifying enough. Is it possible to be healthy?) Fairbairn suggest that as we internalize objects we are inevitably disappointed by them, in order to defend against this pain, we do the follow: We split off those aspects that are too painful to be tolerated.\nRepress these intolerable aspects. This modifies the ego. Pathology occurs when some aspects of the repressed self-object system are excessively repressed, leaving the central self depleted with an impoverished relationship to the 'ideal object.'\nOther forms of pathology occur when the central self system is taken over by one of the usual repressed systems, such as those whose relations are characterized by continual patterns of distance and rage with the apparent disappearance of reality. Fear-dictated flight from early object relations is also considered the deepest root of psychological problems. Skynner (1981) Diffuse boundaries\nUnclear identities\nSatisfaction from fantasy as opposed to reality\nDifficulty coping with separation and loss\nAttempts to preserve past states of relationships\nAttempts to manipulate others into rigidly held views of them The major goal of Object Relations Theory is to free family members of unconscious restrictions so that they will be able to interact with one another as whole, healthy persons on the basis of current realities rather than unconscious images. The encounter between the therapist and client is the intervention. The relationship is the crucible for change and growth. The therapeutic process is the same as 'normal development' during infancy. The therapist provides the holding environment, contains/introjects the clients' emotions, resolves them, understands them, somehow makes them acceptable, and then the client introjects the resolution of the emotions. Therapist projects back a 'corrective experience.'\nSelf of therapist is key: Transference and counter-transference are the keystones of any psychoanalytic therapy, meaning the therapist must constantly be aware of who they are' for the client, and who the client is for them. Change occurs through insight and working through. Techniques: Listening\nEmpathy\nInterpretation and maintaining neutrality with respect to what or how things change Big Picture (how families operate/develop): He uses attachment theory as a base. Early attachment relationships create 'working models' of how relationships are supposed to be, they create 'scripts.' as people interact with each other to become a family, they create their own 'family script' based on these early 'working models.' families have attachment patterns that are full of meanings about abandonment, engulfment, intrusion, etc. (i.e., distance regulation)\nThese scripts provide routines for family life which can be followed automatically. They are shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.\nThese scripts may be carried out from generation to generation in one form or another. Some use replicative scripts (repeat what has happened in the past), while others use corrective scripts (trying not to repeat scripts from the family of origin). There is a constant tension between these two. Healthy vs. Dysfunctional families Healthy families have scripts that provide a set of roles with which each member can identify and which provides room for improvisation when facing new situations. These scripts promote interactional awareness: Consequences of interaction\nSelf-awareness (why you are acting in a particular way)\nEmpathic awareness (why others are acting in particular ways)\nUnderstanding the meaning of the interaction\nShared coherent perception of what is happening Symptoms occur when there is difficulty updating scripts. They may occur because the script necessary remains someone or something too painful to relive. Intolerable information is blocked or edited both intraphysically and interpersonally (secrets)\\\nSymptoms may also occur when a family script is used to prevent what members may fear to be an even worse disaster. Even though the current script is painful, it is rigidly clung to (the solution has become to problem) Major goal is improvisation (flexibility). In order to create an environment safe enough to explore options however, the therapist must provide a secure base from which to explore. Paradoxically, scripts, although repetitive, provide the background against which change can occur. Attachment notions Secure\nCurious\nImprovisation\nUncertainty\nInsecure\nAvoid strangeness\nStick with the familiar Instead of conflict in the family arising out of one person's pathology which extends to influence another's behavior, family scripts are encoded in all family members' minds, but each family member plays a particular role. Therefore, each member of the family can be taught to see how their role contributes to the problem, rather than asking the 'sick one' to reown the bad object and working through these issues. Reduce strategies that undermine problem-solving abilities (i.e., triangulating, scapegoating, etc.)\nReduce strategies that undermine security (threats about leaving, control, etc.)\nMove toward collaboration rather than coercion and blame. Re-edit scripts so the roles are fillable by the individuals in the family. Move closer to an ideal script in which a wide scope of improvising is possible. Develop a hopeful script. Promote ownership of family's success, attributable to them not you as the therapist. This is still important for the therapist to attend to. The therapist needs to contain the family's emotions in a way so as not to become another player in their script. Therapists own scripts can also be replayed, thus it is essential that the therapist understand their own family script. Byng-Hall outlines methods for staying out of the script and for containing emotional impact: Staying out: Use teams, get supervision, have a clear plan, use circular questioning\nContaining: Reflecting on the process, seeing emotions as valuable information, differentiating your script from the family's, share your emotional experience with the family. Absolves people of responsibility for their behavior (it is my mother's fault)\nLack of empirical testing\nTautological thinking: Make an interpretation, it is rejected, patient is resistant, you must be onto something. Perspective is individualist or dyadic without revision. Deterministic, linear thinking (it is my mother's fault)\nBlaming the victim (you put yourself in this situation, because of what your mother did)\nMother blaming\nLong process\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Object Relations\" href=\"Object Relations\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Object Relations</a> Theory: Big Picture","level":2,"id":"[[Object_Relations]]_Theory_Big_Picture_0"},{"heading":"Stages of Object Relations","level":3,"id":"Stages_of_Object_Relations_0"},{"heading":"Health/Dysfunction","level":3,"id":"Health/Dysfunction_0"},{"heading":"Symptoms","level":3,"id":"Symptoms_0"},{"heading":"Dysfunctional Family","level":3,"id":"Dysfunctional_Family_0"},{"heading":"Intervention","level":3,"id":"Intervention_0"},{"heading":"Byng-Hall (1995) Family Scripts","level":2,"id":"Byng-Hall_(1995)_Family_Scripts_0"},{"heading":"Symptoms","level":2,"id":"Symptoms_1"},{"heading":"Interventions","level":2,"id":"Interventions_0"},{"heading":"Difference from other Psychoanalytic Models","level":2,"id":"Difference_from_other_Psychoanalytic_Models_0"},{"heading":"Intervention Strategies","level":2,"id":"Intervention_Strategies_0"},{"heading":"Transference/Countertransference","level":2,"id":"Transference/Countertransference_0"},{"heading":"Critique of Psychoanalytic Theories","level":2,"id":"Critique_of_Psychoanalytic_Theories_0"}],"links":["glossary/cft-keywords/object-relations.html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/4.-psychoanalytic-models-of-family-therapy/4.-psychoanalytic-models-of-family-therapy.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1705619815055,"modifiedTime":1724752448212,"sourceSize":9272,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/4.

As humans, we are born with value and are entitled to do care. When we do not get that, we develop a destructive entitlement. We seek others to meet our needs.

Overgiving Over functioning, one of the partners decides what is wrong and how to fix it. They decide what is wrong with the other person and how they need to fix it.

I understand why you may think that way.' You want the couples to learn how to validate someone else's perspective. Not agreeing with it, but just expanding the ability for a person to have compassion for others. Getting couples to ask for what You have been with me long enough you should know. Opening up of relational issues. People cannot be in a relationship and give nothing. Keep looking for their contribution. Want couples to validate each other and themselves. As people acknowledge that other people make contributions (due consideration), we feel that we are getting the due consideration. For couples therapy - considering Transitional\nNonjudgmental\nFacilitating - 'sowing seeds and opening doors' and giving moratorium But - therapy still can be 'short-term' Avoids becoming parentified\nTherapists' own relational histories may resonate with those of their clients 'Self-of-the-therapist' issues may prevent clinicians from keeping a balanced stance towards members of the family\nTherapist does not need to be liked by their clients.

Experiential Family Therapy","icon":"","description":"\nMyth of Fusion: Human's must come to grips with 'aloneness.' Once we accept our aloneness then we have to make meaning for our lives. \"We believe people who love us should 'just know' what we need.\"\nWe have to accept we are a self. Once we accept our aloneness, we must make meaning of our lives. Freedom and Responsibility\nHumanistic Psychology: Humans are good and move toward growth if unhindered. Whitaker and others claim to be a-theoretical. However, Whitaker was a systems theorist and used ideas from humanistic psychology and psychoanalytic theory to guide his therapy. <a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a> thought he could change a family behind a mirror by telling a therapist what to do. Experiential therapists did not believe this is true. They want the family to be open to their emotional experience and thoughts they are having. Anti-Technician: Rather than a-theoretical, Whitaker and other experiential therapists are anti-technician. Manipulation does not encourage open experiencing. Through feeling expression, families are able to balance separateness and connectedness. Always 'becoming' or moving forward, toward growth. Emotions/affect are validated and nurtured. Rules create balance: respect for affect and getting along. Permeable boundaries which encourage expression of intimacy needs, differentiation, bonding, conflict expression/resolution, problem solving, and playfulness. Symptoms develop when affect is blocked, impulses are denied and feelings are suppressed. Boundaries and processes are rigid: holding themselves together is more important than experiencing life. Superficial experience of emotion, self-denial, lack of empathy, lack of commitment, inability to handle conflict\nLittle awareness, little sense of choice, flow of behavior is blocked because of unexpressed emotion.\n<br><a data-href=\"Carl Whitaker\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Carl Whitaker</a> suggested that there were 3 contexts to our symptoms: 'Driven Crazy' in an interpersonal context in which person is belittled or disqualified.\n'Going Crazy' a state of temporary disorganization.\n'Acting Crazy' an adaptation to the context. Increased personal integrity, greater freedom of choice, less dependence, expanded experiencing. Strengthening the family as a system by increasing connectedness within the nuclear family and across generations. Enhance ability to support the completion of developmental tasks. Battle for Structure\nBattle for Initiative\nWorking Phase\nTermination\nUse of non-rational, symbol, and metaphor. Use of self is paramount: any technique comes from the therapist's creativity. Create a new therapeutic environment to alter the family's interaction in hopes of producing a different affective experience. Interrupt rigid, repetitive cycles\nActivate and allow for constructive anxiety or confusion. Expand the presenting problem\nEncourage and support any new decision (freedom to choose). Create trans-generational boundaries. Create a therapeutic supra-system in which the therapist and family are aligned, and the therapist still has the ability to differentiate (get in and get out). Self-Worth: How people learn to be people Communication: The ways people use to work out meaning with one another (Placating, Blaming, Computing, Distracting, Leveling/Congruence) Placating (peacekeeper)\nBlamer (im not happy its your fault)\nComputing (have to have a rational explanation, ultra rationale)\nDistracting (acts out when there is stress, someone who uses humor)\nLeveling/Congruence Rules: The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into the family system. Freedom to comment: What can you say\nTo whom can you say it\nHow do you go about it if you disagree or disapprove of someone or something\nHow do you question when you do not understand\nTaboo subjects\nTaboo feelings\nExpressing affection\nSecrets Overarching goal may be to loosen up the system so there is freedom to comment. Maybe you say it yourself, maybe use family sculpting, Link to Society: How the family interacts with the outside world When communication patterns are rigid (other than congruence) and continual, and you can't comment on that.\nSymptoms are symptoms of the system\nSymptoms are created through the process of interaction Low self-worth\nCommunication is indirect, vague, not honest\nRules are rigid and non-negotiable\nLink to society is fearful, placating, and blaming Congruence (you the therapist must be congruent) (as a therapist, when you have a sense of what is going on in the room, you say it\n“Recording 20240412103404.webm” could not be found.\n)\n- Only with congruence can we know each other fully and we can use our differences creatively. Focus of intervention Helping people change and grow in: Communication\nBeliefs about being able to grow\nRestoring the use of all the senses Therapist use of self is key (as with all experiential models) To alleviate symptoms you have to intervene in the process in a way that won't replicate their process. Conditions for Chage Trust\nDevelopment of awareness\nDevelopment of understanding\nDevelopment of awareness of options\nPractice Universal goal for all families Development of self-worth\nFreedom to comment Techniques should emerge from the therapist/client interaction. Techniques are only useful in a context of trust.

HDFS journals is minimal (10%-20%). Usually rejected for fit, editor may not like your topic, 3 reviewers if paper has potential, reviewers are people in my field who give extensive paragraph, 3 primary options (accepted (very rare), revise and resubmit (common, substantial changes need to be made, may need to do a couple times for it to be accepted), rejections (happens frequently, still getting feedback, feedback is always something you can improve)) Time you submit to when you get it back (3-5 months usually to get paper back) How much time you take on a paper will vary\nAverage time is about a year to a year and a half (if paper is accepted by place you submitted) (publishing early matters)\nRevise and resubmit Institute of Medicine, standards of authorship, Are your consultations based on this person teaching you how to do it and you do it on your own, or it is them just doing it for you. That could change authorship. You want your work to serve multiple purposes and how can I make a paper out of it?

Quantitative studies: reliability and validity; prior studies; how does this measure capture the constructs you are talking about in your literature review and research questions?\nQualitative studies: What steps are you taking to ensure rigor? The literature review/introduction will direction follow your opening 2-3 paragraphs. Goal is to explain the rationale for the work you are doing. Not to comprehensively summarize every related study ever\nShow your work builds off of prior theory and empirical work\nHighlight the unique contributions of your work Although you may not review every related study, you need to do a thorough literature review to understand how your study relates to others and how your study fits. Focus on peer-reviewed journal articles\nTry to get a sense of paper by looking at abstract and skimming before committing to fully reading To do this more effectively, you should plan out the sections of your literature review in advance Based on your questions\nProvide an organization/headings for your literature review\nYour questions may be a series of questions (each will become a header in your literature review/introduction)\nOr your questions may build upon each other Your sequential logic becomes the headers for your introduction\nAnd it ensures that you know the 'argument' for each section (because you have the arrows drawn and connections made already) Note: your argument does not mean you ignore findings that don't support your hypothesis - you use them as arguments as to why your research is needed. Ultimately, should match your first 2/3 paragraphs, methods, results, and discussion. Keep your headings general and big picture\nConsider ending with a, 'The present study...' section\nMay have to include a conceptual or theoretical paragraph somewhere Often easier to discuss theory within your aims-based headings Try not to use jargon, simple words instead\nDo not repeat yourself even if it is written in a different way (e.g., put another way)\nDo not provide laundry list of extant literature; instead, synthesize What is it? Is it attainable?\nThink about research you have read recently? Do you think they have adequately discussed generalizability?\nBig takeaways: Being as thoughtful as possible about our sampling plan before collecting data is going to help us create higher quality research. Be transparent about the ways in which your research is or is not generalizable. Getting good samples is really hard. Your research doesn't have to be perfect (remember no study is). Sample Generalizability: Can findings based on a sample be applied to the larger population from which the sample was drawn?\nNeed for 'thick description' Cross-Population Generalizability Can findings from a study of one population be applied ot other populations?\nUsually infers in universality (although doesn't have to) Sampling is unnecessary if all the units in the population are identical (e.g., blood)\nBut what about people? Are fundamental psychological processes the same across all people (universal)? When random sampling is not possible\nAvailability (Convenience) Sampling: Take who you can get\nExploratory or qualitative research\nIntro to psych! It is okay to use convenience sampling but you need to be aware of and acknowledging your limitations. Quota Sampling: Make sure sample represents certain characteristics in the population (but can't know all characteristics, and not random)\nThis is not as good as random/probability sampling but is still a much improved strategy over convenience sampling. Purposive Sampling: Studying a subset of limited group\nStudying 'key informants'\nHigh on internal validity Population: The entire set of individuals or other entities (e.g., families, schools) to which study findings are to be generalized\nCensus = study the whole population Sampling Frame A list of all the elements in a population Sample A subset of a population used to study the population as a whole Two factors that make it easier to get a representative sample: Larger samples are more likely to be representative Sample size does matter in quantitative research\nBoth for generalizability and power\nHowever, unthoughtful sampling doesn't improve much with larger samples. It is easier to derive a representative sample from a homogenous population (i.e., can have a smaller sample) Allows us to know in advance how likely it is that any element of a population will be selected.

Science is more interesting when it's true: Data management makes your data and your conclusions more accurate. Some researchers are very uncomfortable with data sharing. They make 3 basic arguments: It was my idea to collect these data. I did all the work\nIt's against the ethos of science This will be required for federal grants: Data should be owned by the public that funded it\nAllows data to have a wider reach\nMakes sharing with other authors easier\nKeeps data archived and accessible long-term The Inter-University consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)\nLots of resouirces on how to share\nGood confidentiality and maintenance policies\nOSU already pays for a site license so it is free Where you're going is dependent on collecting good information.\nImportant to have analyses in mind when choosing what to collect\nBe thoughtful of how you present and word questions to your participants. Make sure your instructions are clear. One of the first things you have to do is select measures. You can't answer a question you haven't measured on your participants. It is important to select ones that reliably and validly measure what you want to know. Document everything. It is hard to remember what you measured, when you measured it, or why you measured it. Your best defense is well documented protocols, a good codebook, documentation of what all of your variable names mean. Key to success with any project is writing things down. Future you won't remember what current you decides to do today, or why you decided to do it. Protocols are written documentation of the decisions you make when designing your data collection. They are living documents that should be continuously updated. They have two important points: The decision made Document who made the decision and when\nThe decision is a rule to be implemented across the project A rationale for why the decision was made. Think about someone else using your data later, and what they will need to know.

Global variable naming protocol: XXXX#YYY or PPVT1001 X: Short Survey / Scale\n#: Timepoint\nY: Unique Identifier You can make your own rule, but make sure you document them. Don't change them. A codebook is a key translating what you give participants into the data you store. Necessary to link between the items given and the variables in your database. Makes interpretation and analysis easier later. Variable values follow similar rules\nKeep them consistent across your project\nDocument them in the codebook\nThink about someone else using your data later, and what they will need to know. Hack: If you have a dichotomous variables, don't name it after the construct.\nName it after a category, such that 1 = yes or has that attribute. For the question: Is your house green or red? (Bad: 'HouseColor'; Good: 'HouseGreen') With multiple response questions, make sure the order of options makes sense. (Bad: '-20k, 10k, &lt;10k, &gt;20k'; Better: -&lt;10k, 10k, 20k, &gt;20k) Tracking your participants (master list, consort, change form)\nTracking data collection (on the fly messiness, scheduled and completing data) A master list is a list of every person the project touches. You may have a sub-master-list, which contains only those participants who you have assigned an ID.

You can keep track of this in multiple ways: The Master List\nA separate excel log\nA form or digital form Backing up your data is one of the most essential steps in data processing. This may mean scanning or copying paper data or a more sophisticated digital system. Try to make sure that your department/university has a file server. Shared drive Allow for multiple computers to access the same datafiles. Easier to set back-ups. Every data set has some problems. If you don't think you have data problem, then you haven't looked at it yet. Data needs to be cleaned to be used meaningfully. Be flexible because data cleaning is hard.

(2010). Ground rules for social research: Guidelines for good practice.\nType: Book\nTitle: Ground rules for social research: guidelines for good practice, Author: Denscombe, Martyn; Publisher: Open Univ. Press, McGraw-Hill,\nLocation: Maidenhead,\nSeries: Open Up study skills\nYear: 2010 ISBN: 978-0-335-23381-6 Keywords: In Progress (Denscombe, 2010, p. 17)“the purpose of the research is something that needs to be understood concisely, precisely and right from the beginning.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)“a clear vision of the purpose of research provides a crucial basis for evaluating the research” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)“This allows readers to evaluate the research by providing benchmarks against which to judge the extent to which the research has been successful.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)“a clear vision of the purpose of research provides a good platform from which to conduct the investigation. This applies whether the research uses a quantitative, a qualitative, or a mixed methods approach” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)“Clarity of purpose also calls on the researcher to identify a relatively narrow and precise area for investigation rather than setting out to investigate some general area of interest. It requires the researcher to focus attention on specific aspects, specific questions, specific issues within the broader area of interest.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)“unless some quite specific topic is pinpointed, there is the very real danger that: • researchers will ‘bite off more than they can chew’; • researchers will flounder in a sea of vast quantities of issues and data; • time will be wasted on the collection of unnecessary information; • time will be wasted on meanderings up blind alleys before a clear direction becomes evident; • vague questions might lead to vague answers.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)“Social research questions must be, in principle, testable. Explanations and theories must be open to proof or disproof” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)“The research should also offer something new.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)“The literature review is particularly important” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)“To offer something new or different, the research needs to build on existing knowledge and link to what is already known on a particular topic or issue.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)“Good research avoids the pitfall of being over-ambitious in terms of its scale and its scope.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)“it is essential that the research does not set out to do something that is illegal or immoral.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)“the project researcher should ensure that his/her activities accord with ethical standards and codes of conduct that operate for the discipline, the profession and the country in which the research is located.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)“descriptive research, which provides detailed accounts of events or situations in order to gain a clearer picture of what is going on.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)“explanatory research, which is mainly concerned with cause–effect relationships. It builds on well-established theories with a view to developing them and using them to make predictions that can be tested. It aims to explain why things happen.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)“exploratory research, which investigates new areas and which seeks to generate new theories and concepts.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)“The rights and interests of participants and others directly affected by the research will be taken into consideration. The research will be conducted in accord with an appropriate code of research ethics. Approval will be sought from a relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. The research will be conducted in an honest, open and transparent manner – as far as it is possible.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)“Ethics refers to the system of moral principles by which individuals can judge their actions as right or wrong, good or bad” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)“researchers need to introduce a moral perspective to the way they design and conduct their investigations.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)“need to consider what will be acceptable in the context of the values of the wider society in which the research is conducted” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)“The motivation for researchers to operate ethically should be a matter of professional integrity” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)“‘The acceptability of social research depends increasingly on the willingness of social researchers to accord respect to their subjects and to treat them with consideration.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)“Research that does not do this will damage the reputation of social research” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)“without the good will and trust of the public large parts of social research will become starved of information.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)“Research” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)“must take account of the moral and legal climate of the time and the boundaries this places on the topics of investigation that are deemed acceptable and the nature of the methods of investigation it tolerates.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)\nGround rule: Research should produce findings from which generalizations can be made. Either the research is based on a sample of people, events, or data that are representative of the wider population (generalizability).\nOr sufficient information is given about the characteristics of the sample or the cases used in the research for judgements to be made about the extend to which findings can be expected to apply more widely (transferability).\nOr the people, events, or data included in the research have been chosen because of their particular characteristics and the belief that these characteristics will be helpful for generating and developing theories (theory relevance). “A generalization involves drawing some conclusion about a whole group or category of things on the basis of information drawn from particular instances or examples. On the basis of what is found to exist in a relatively few instances or examples, propositions are made about the nature and qualities of the whole class.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 195) “Researchers usually wish to feel confident that their findings have been based on samples that are either representative of, or have particular characteristics that are significant for the analysis of, the broader class of thing being investigated. Another reason centers on the researcher's wish to produce generalized knowledge in the form of theories.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 195-196) “The concern with generalizations relates to the way findings from specific pieces of research lend themselves to the development of propositions that work very widely – possibly universally – and that contribute to establishing rules or theories about the workings of social phenomena.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196) Generalizations Continue to be a crucial aspect of good research for all but a small minority of those operating under the umbrella of ‘social research’\nCan be justified in different ways depending on the nature of the particular research and its underlying assumptions\nNeed to be incorporated into the rationale for the research.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196) “the criteria for selection are the crucial starting point when it comes to generalizations.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)\n“the selection of the items to be included in the study needs to be done on a logical basis – a basis that allows generalizations from the data to be defended as reasonable and justifiable – and within social research there are broadly two approaches to this matter. One way is to go for a representative sample. This tends to be favored by relatively large-scale survey research using quantitative data and a positivistic approach. The alternative is to select the items for study on the basis of their particular characteristics. Smaller-scale research involving case studies, qualitative data and an interpretivist approach tend to rely on this.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)\nDo the findings from the research apply elsewhere? Have the criteria for selection of the people, events, or data been described and justified?\nReflecting the criteria for selection, have an adequate number and appropriate diversity of people, events, or data been included in the research?\nDoes the description of the sample or cases used in the research allow comparisons with others of their type? Research tends to focus on a reduced number of instances of the thing under investigation. It investigates a sample or it investigates specific cases. To what extend do the findings from the sample or case apply to other instances that were not included in the study? To be representative, samples need to: Cover all relevant types\nHave these types in proportion to the volumes found in the whole population A representative sample includes a balanced cross-section of all of the relevant instances. This justifies generalizing from the findings of the sample. To achieve representativeness: Use of random samples. Provided that the units included (people, observations, etc.) in the research are sufficiently large and are chosen on a genuinely random basis, the end result ought to be representative of the total population from which they were drawn. There is the selection of samples by quotas. On the basis of attributes of the population which are already known, the researcher can select samples deliberately to include all the relevant types and to cover these types in proportion to their profile in the total population. It is not always easy for researchers to obtain a sample that qualifies as 'representative' according to these strict criteria. It demands that we know relevant details about the whole population. Social researchers frequently rely on a less stringent version of representativeness in which the principle remains the same but the rigor of selection of the sample is relaxed somewhat. The principle is still that the instances used for the research allow for the findings of the research to be extrapolated to other instances not included in the research. The researcher does not claim that the sample necessarily meets all the criteria of representativeness. The claim is that the instances used for research are 'typical'. The word 'typical' carries with it some notion of being standard, of being normal, of being usual. It suggests that any findings from the sample will apply elsewhere because the instances included in the sample have no particularly unusual characteristics that mark them out from the rest. While claims to conducting research on 'typical' instances certainly retain the need to identify key features relevant to the investigation, the sample might not include all of the relevant categories. The claim to generalizability, however, persists through the emphasis on: Including the main type\nAchieving some balance of the numbers in each category A case study approach is used when a researcher's focus is on a limited number of instances. Researchers can make the strategic decision to concentrate their investigation on one or a few cases in order to allow greater depth to their research, more attention to the dynamics of the situation, better insights that come from a detailed knowledge and understanding of a specific example. (Qualitative researchers favor this strategy)\nExample: There is almost no chance of getting a sample that is large enough and widespread enough to satisfy the criteria for being representative, in a statistical sense, of the whole 'population.' The selection tends to rely on a more purposeful process in which examples are chosen for their particular qualities, as opposed to being chosen with no regard for their individual traits (random) or being chosen with respect to some general category (quota). There are 4 grounds on which cases might be chosen to reflect their particular qualities: Researchers can justify generalizations from their case study (or small sample) if they can establish that the instance included in the research was typical of other instances. The basis for the generalization is that whatever was found in the one instance actually studies was likely to appear in other instances because there was nothing unusual, nothing special, about the case that was investigated. Social researchers can opt to focus on instances that are anything but representative or typical. 'Extreme' instances may be selected deliberately because they have certain qualities that exaggerate the influence of a particular factor that is of interest to the researchers. Things might be visible in these circumstances simply because the situation is extreme or special, and that these might be impossible to detect in more 'watered down' instances. Things become visible here that would remain hidden under typical circumstances. (It can suggest the way things might develop if typical instances start to shift towards the special or extreme. The special/extreme example might act to alert is to factors that would otherwise have remained hidden under the typical circumstances. What was detected in the extreme instance should be looked for in the typical.) Researchers might decide to focus on instances which would appear to present a least likely scenario in terms of the theory or proposition they are investigating. Following the commitment to testing theories to destruction and challenging existing theories or suppositions through attempting to 'falsify' them, there is clear logic to choosing instances that might be expected to 'go against the grain' and prove the theory wrong. The selection of a case might reflect the fact that it constitutes an event or situation that is a special case - a one-off or extremely rare occurrence. It is almost certain that such events or situations are beyond the control of the researcher in the sense that he or she could not organize for them to happen, as in an experiment. The timing and the location of the event will be something to which the researcher responds rather than initiates. The degree to which the findings from the small number of events or cases being studies might be expected to apply elsewhere can be addressed by comparing and contrasting the nature of the specific units of study with the broader population of such units that exist. The selection of instances for research can be based on their usefulness in terms of the contrast they offer with other instances chosen to be included in the research. The researcher can deliberately set out to select examples that provide a stark contrast with one another and that represent the widest variation possible within the thing being studied. Choosing them to achieve a maximum variation allows the research to use the comparative method, controlling for key variables such as size and location, to see what other factors might appear to be linked with these. Selection on the basis of comparison can be useful: It can allow an element of 'triangulation' between alternatives. The researcher is able to see how a certain thing works in two or more very different settings. It is useful where the research design is emergent. Where the researcher selects cases as part of an unfolding path of discovery, then the idea that has emerged from the one example can be compared with the next sample, which might be consciously chosen as one that is different.

These papers will be written in response to the readings for that week. What should you talk about in your reaction papers? The papers should be a comment on the theory and research for that week. It can be an idea for further research or theory, a new way of applying one of the articles, a criticism, or an integration or comparison between two or more articles. Do not summarize. I have read the articles already. In these papers I am expecting you to come up with an original idea that in some way extends our understanding of the topic. At the end of each reaction paper, you should pose at least one discussion question. Some considerations when posing your questions: Your question should be related to the thought/reflection that you develop (i.e., provide a rationale for asking the question)—I am as interested in your thought processes as I am in the question itself. If you question the methodology of a particular study, be sure you are clear as to why there may be a methodological problem.\nPossible answers the question; (i.e., Don’t ask rhetorical questions and try to ask questions that go beyond the material); 3.) Avoid asking the same questions every week; 4.) Be sure the question is discussable. Papers should be about 2 pages, double-spaced. You are required to turn in 11 reaction papers, but you will have opportunity to write one for 13 weeks. I will take the 11 highest grades. You will upload your paper to Carmen by 11:59pm the Tuesday before class—this will allow time for me and your classmates (see below) to integrate your questions into the presentation and discussion for a give article. Please make sure you proofread your writing for grammar and spelling errors. One strategy that may be helpful is reading the paper out loud prior to turning a paper in.

Examples: Economic and exchange theories Assume that all behavior is reducible to rewards/costs of behavioral exchanges. <br>Attachment theory (<a data-href=\"Attachment Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/attachment-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attachment Theory</a>) Assumes that our template for socializing with people can be primarily explained by the relationship with have with a primary attachment figure. <br>Family Systems Theory (<a data-href=\"Family Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Systems Theory</a>) Assumes all behaviors are linked to the larger social unit of analysis. While each of these are partly true, not every interaction we have in a relationship is rationale (e.g., Exchange theory: sometimes we make costly decisions in a relationship even when we know another behavior my help the relationship are we more motivated for ourselves or the relationship? Attachment theory Although our relationship with primary caregivers are important in childhood, attachment theory doesn’t necessarily deal with genetic, personality, or environmental constraints/affordances that can shape these relationships; Family systems: although family dynamics are powerful, where is the role of autonomy and self-efficacy that can explain shifts away from embedded family norms and patterns of behaviors?) Concepts are the key features of a theory. These are the ideas/concepts (often variables) that we measure and focus on when we think of theory. For example, if you were interested in conducting a study around (social exchange, attachment, or family systems theory) what would you potentially be interested in measuring in your study? – give an example if none come up). Exactly, concepts are the ideas/constructs that allow us to think/apply the theory to something we are interested in studying. These are the hypotheses based on the assumptions and constructs in a given theory. For example, one proposition we might pull from social exchange theory is that in a relationship, when potential alternatives (e.g., other partners) seem more rewarding than our current relationships, we could expect someone might choose to end the relationship or cheat. For attachment theory, we could hypothesize that when someone is high in the anxiety dimension of attachment, they might seem more reassurance from their partner than someone lower in anxiety. For family systems, we could hypothesize that when families have rigid boundaries, it may be harder to intervene and change a child’s problematic behavior than if the family had less rigid boundaries.

To mid-range or lower-range theories that attempt to explain and provide specific hypotheses about families or specific family behaviors/outcomes. This idea is helpful to keep in mind as not all theories are well-suited for every level of analysis. Some theories may be better suited for certain methodologies than others.

Multiple frameworks operate simultaneously, but also within each framework, there is a ”normal science” paradigm for each theory within sub-disciplines.

This also helps us understand how certain fields have similar concepts with different names.\nGive examples—spanking research by Liz Gershoff, minority vs minoritized Using contextual theory, fam scientists have integrated multiple philosophies (e.g., the uncertainty of measurement conceptualized through alphas and p-values to inform falsification/hypothesis testing). Also, family scientists are skeptics that many concepts are made up and can never know if they fully match Reality.\nAlso use operationalization (logical empiricists) to measure concepts while acknowledging that they may imprecisely match theory and observation.\n“When it comes to theory testing, most family theorists are aware of the limits of falsification, but within those limits are comfortable employing its procedures. “\n“Most family scientists believe in verification, sometimes implicitly using Bayesian concepts of probability, so that our confidence in an abstract or contextual theory increases with additional empirical support.”\n“However, family scientists believe that an accumulation of differently flawed observations can begin to approximate the boundaries of Reality. “ “Family scientists are mostly reasonable realists who anticipate that there is probably a “Real World” out there; we really do believe there are families. However, we also recognize that there are many distinct but overlapping perspectives (frameworks) from which family life can be multiple and simultaneously understood. “\n“Family scientists are reasonable skeptics who recognize that many, if not most, of our concepts are made up from our imaginations, and that we will never know how much—or if—they match Reality.” “Mini revolutions, ”e.g., Family scientists integrate multiple theories to make sense of the world\nChallenge of Meaning “Supernatural explanations for disease, divine spheres for planetary motion, falling objects seeking their proper place, and the “invisible hand” of economics were replaced by germs, gravity, and individual preference schedules do . Why people think they are ill, where a falling object “wants” to be: these sorts of meaning-based explanations are no longer proposed. In these historical cases, meaning explanations have been replaced by causal explanations. “In the end, both realists and skeptics agree that there are limits to what we can know, so whether improved explanations are closer to Truth as realists claim or more useful as practical understanding as skeptics claim, it doesn’t actually make a difference in what we do with our explanations. “ Who defines the concepts? How often do we reevaluate the theoretical frameworks that outline our understanding of families?\nHow might theoretical frameworks help control the ways in which family life is defined and understood within research? Thoughts about theory as described through metaphor? Is our ability to describe theory through metaphor a signal of the utility/practicality of a theory?\nWill family science have its Newton, who will create a new, grand theoretical framework to replace all the current ones? Coleman (1990) –would it be useful to have a grand theory of family dynamics?\nWhat might be some examples of the “challenge of meaning” in HDFS/family science/ your own area?\n“One thing we learned from Kuhn is that research is accepted when it is persuasive. What is considered persuasive does not distinguish realists from skeptics.” Thoughts about this quote (p 17) The Institute for Population Research &amp; Census are examples of what demographers do.\nMay sound familiar as you often need to include “demographics” in your research projects.\nTraditionally defined as studying three population processes, fertility, mortality, and migrations. More modern conceptualizations are social demography that seek to study population processes that may not fully align with these big three (e.g., Family Demography is a big field). Family Demography typically two types of studies: Careful tracking and measurement of families at either a given time point or trends over time. Focus on the social, cultural, and economic correlates, precursors, and consequences of family structure and transitions. “Diverging Destinies” framework, articulated by McLanahan (2004), indicates that families are increasingly dissimilar across social class lines, often proxied by educational attainment.\nA theme you will notice about a lot of demographic and sociological explanations is that they take an economic or structural approach to understanding families, marriage, child-birth, and development.\n<br><img alt=\"Demographic Transitions.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/demographic-transitions.png\" target=\"_self\"> <br><img alt=\"2.

Lower marriage rates for Black Americans (i.e., growing black-white differences in marriage rates). But also true for Hispanic and AINA than White and API women) – Why though? Those with higher SES more likely be married (true for White and Black women). May be explained by economic “readiness” the people link to marriage (it has become a luxury good), which is not as available to those without college degrees.\nMay be explained by marriage market availability and mass incarceration. Second Demographic Transition and the “singles are coming”\nRemarriage and divorce remain common. Longer time to remarriage for black and Latina women compared to white women.\nHighest remarriage rates for higher educational levels Post-divorce cohabitation may be replacing marriage given the high divorce rate.\nRemarriage = more stepfamilies. Divorce rates increased steadily between 1960 and rates remain high since 1970s, but divorce rates have declined since 1980s (though still historically high). May continue to decline as younger adults have lower divorce rates. Paired with older ages of marriage, young adults who marry may also be a select group of more committed people. <br>Greater divorces rates among older Americans (i.e., 50+) has been called the “<a data-href=\"Grey Divorce\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/grey-divorce.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grey Divorce</a>” Largely driven by baby boomers who had high rates of dissolution to begin with. Divorce is dramatically stratified by education with up to 60% of those without HS or GED getting divorced (isn’t it expensive? And might this contribute to income inequality given that divorce and relationship dissolution is typically costly?). Smaller educational difference for Black women compared to White women, but overall the differences between White and Black women, Black women’s marriages were more likely to dissolve. “Since the early 2000s, the relationship between divorce rates and unemployment rates has been negative; that is, when unemployment went down, the divorce rate went up, and when unemployment went up (as during the Great Recession), divorce rates went down” Small effects\nRecessions delayed rather than forgoing divorce.\nWhen men become unemployed when separated, tend to delays divorce.\nWhen in economic straights, may be likely to forgo divorce unless remarriage is on the horizon. Marriage may be delayed but people are still not delaying living with intimate partners.\nRates of cohabitation with different gender partner sped up since the 1970s.\nMost women cohabitate by there mid-late twenties. Cohabitation also common among those 50+.\nVery common to live with a spouse beforehand.\nMarriage or dissolutions following cohabitation within 2-3 years. Lower likelihood of cohabitation if at least a bachelor’s degree. College-educated women were more likely to transition into marriage from cohabitation than less educated women.\nCohabitation is more of a steppingstone to marriage, especially for the more economically disadvantaged\nDecoupling of marriage and childbearing, as evidenced by increase in cohabitation and retreat from marriage. Increase in non-marital births largely attributed to cohabitating couples. Cohabitation used to be associated with marital instability, but more recent studies do not show this trend. Explanations were selection (cohabitators had more positive attitudes towards divorce).\nExperiences while cohabiting deterred people from marriage (trial marriage hypothesis).\nWhite women who cohabited were more likely to divorce compared to Black and Mexican American women.\nCohabitation may stabilize remarriage.\nExplanation for disappearing cohabitation may be the normative nature of it. Research from other countries supports this idea. Fertility rates of in US have largely declined since 1970s, with a slight increase between 1990s and 2007, after which they continued to fall – this is the case across racial/ethnic groups. Decline since 2007 largely due to declines in birth among young women. Teen births are at an all-time low.\nUS has higher TFR than most European countries, but still below replacement level fertility.\nGreat recession reduced fertility somewhat among younger women, but its unclear if this is a termporary or a longer-term effect.\nBig decline in fertility for Hispanic immigrants, likely because the recession reduced immigration from Mexico.\nNot clear why “Longer term structural changes, especially the decline of manufacturing and construction, also depress fertility; thus fertility rates may be unlikely to rebound soon (Seltzer, 2019).”\nEducational differences in children are relatively small, but more educated women tend to have fewer children. However, recent evidence suggests that fertility rates are increasing among women with advanced degrees. May be explained by these women's ability to outsource childcare, availability of childcare has increased, and spouses participate more in childcare.\\\nWomen college graduates also delay childbirth. 40% of all births are to unmarried women – also, something like 30% - 50% of pregnancies are unintended This tends to be more common for women with less than HS degree (also a group that is less likely to get married and more likely to get divorced.)\nNon-marital births are increasing for white women, which has contributed to smaller differences in non-marital child birth differences between white/black women. Multi-partner fertility has increased 14%-25% in general — higher in unmarried families and cohabitating families.\nLess associated with martial fertility in stepfamilies and non-marital fertility. Covid led to a baby “bust.”\nSame-gender unions Somewhere between 500-800k married same gender couples. Married and cohabitating same-gender couples tend to have higher SES. More schooling\nBoth partners employed\nSlightly more white\nHigher median household income Male same-gender couples tend to have higher SES (because of patriarchy).\nSame-gender couples are less likely to have children (there are many barriers to having children if they aren’t from a previous relationship). Higher rates of childrearing among female same-gender couples. Education gradient in child rearing is more dramatic at higher than lower levels of education for same-gender couples (they have fewer children).\n“Same-gender couples with children in the home tend to have less education, lower median incomes, and higher poverty rates than different-gender parents despite the fact that same-gender couples as a whole have higher incomes and education than different-gender couples.” When controlling for relevant factors, children in female same-sex couple households have similar poverty rates as those in different gender households. \"Controlling for education, demographic, marital status, and health measures, lesbian women and gay men are not more likely to be poor than heterosexuals, but bisexual women and men are more likely to be poor (Badgett, 2018).” We don’t really understand why bisexual people have poorer outcomes. Adoption rates are higher among same-gender unions Still lots of challenges in accessing pathways to parenthood and adoption. Overall decline in parenthood among same-gender couples.\nGreater dissolution among female same-gender couples. “Since the Great Recession, legal immigration has leveled off, and the size of the undocumented immigrant population has remained relatively constant or declined somewhat, depending on the estimate.”\nForeign born population has stayed around 15% between 1890 and 2017\n•Most immigrants are from the Americas, particularly, Mexico•“As of 2017, the largest groups of immigrants are from South and East Asia (27%), Mexico (25%), other countries in Latin America (25%), and Europe or Canada (13%; Radford &amp; Noe-Bustamante, 2019).”•Marriage is common 61%, may be due to them being younger/typical age for marriage•24% of Hispanic women will separate or get divorced – this rate has been increasing slowly•There is quite a bit of heterogeneity in divorce rates based on specific ethnic groups (important point to acknowledge when talking about race/ethnicity that’s not covered here.)•“immigration enforcement between 2005 and 2015 raised the likelihood that undocumented mothers lived without their spouses by 20% and the likelihood that Hispanic U.S.-born children lived without their parents by 19%”•Separations are associated with increased poverty, fear, stress, anxiety, and depression•Births to foreign-born women are a large proportion of all births•In 2014, 23% of U.S.-born babies had foreign-born mothers.

In addition, more time among cohabiting partners and disagreements about social distancing practices could lead to tensions and relationship breakdown (Sheff, 2020 a). Single parents or parents working at home in particular may need to take on additional childcare responsibilities (Goldberg et al., 2021), potentially leading to less time with partners or non-coparent partners spending more time with children.\n<a data-href=\"Queer Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/theory/queer-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Queer Theory</a> Include members who are not biologically or legally connected, and the queer sexuality when they form relationships with more than one person: disentangle romantic, sexual, and coparenting relationships; and include same-gender partners.

However, CNM relationships differ in their degree of compliance with and challenges to heteronormativity. For example, some polyamorous parents try to “pass” as monogamous, whereas others come out and actively compel institutions or other people to recognize their families (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2010). Decreased contact Connection across distance\nDistance from children Parents with less time with parents tended to not be cisgender women: only one of these seven parents was a cisgender woman or only a biological parent; rather, three were trans or nonbinary, two were cisgender men, and most were a&nbsp; combination of stepparents, nonbiological parents, biological parents, and adoptive parents.\nPandemic may have more of an impact on parent–child relationships when one or more characteristics of parents deviates from the dominant heteronorm of the primary parent (i.e., female, biological).\nThe children lived with other parents prior to the pandemic, and in others, parents made the decision for children to live with different caregivers such as grandparents or coparents during the pandemic due to risk of exposure (e.g., parent was a frontline worker) or socialization considerations (e.g., the desire to give the child more time with other family members).\n\"A relationship, shared,&nbsp; a family, we decided it would be good for my kid to spend some time with my ex. Once that happened I have been able to visit my boyfriend twice (after 3 months apart). Both the kid and my ex is happier for the kid being up there.” Hsin-Yi’s account illustrates one way of resolving the desire to see their boyfriend and limit networks of risk exposure while also allowing their child to spend more time with other coparents. Changing dynamics and configurations at home More time at home •This practice of incorporating multiple partners into a living unit could be beneﬁcial in having a “large, robust household” to combat isolation, but also introduced challenges related to sharing space and dividing time among partners. Isabella, a bisexual white polyamorous stepmother to a toddler, elaborated: Fortunately, even those who discussed the stress of living in close quarters commented on the skills and strengths that they possessed as people who engaged in CNM, which enabled them to effectively communicate about their needs and boundaries.\nBut one thing polys are pretty good at is sort of working through issues as they arise.”“Several parents spoke to the strengths of their communication and conflict resolution skills.\nAnother approach to spend more time with partners while avoiding some of the complications of moving everyone into the same house was creating multi-household quarantine pods, which sometimes further challenged heteronormative notions of family through the intentional and collaborative construction of small communities. Increased parenting responsibility Significant stress and desire for greater social support.\nSupport for parents was generally appreciated both by children and co-parents. Negotiating risk For some, this involved a process of pausing and unpausing CNM relationships as participants made decisions about safety and relative risk.\nNewly exploring CNM, the pandemic seemed to at least temporarily foreclose the possibility of opening the relationship.\nFor other participants with established relationships, the labor and thought that went into seeing existing partners appeared to take priority over the work of trying to safely meet new partners.\nOthers noted their reluctance to meet with new individuals given the politicization of responses to COVID-19.\nPerhaps because those in CNM relationships often have significant experience communicating needs and boundaries to partners (including negotiating expectations around safer sex behaviors), many participants mentioned the conversations they have with partners about COVID risk without characterizing them as challenging or conflictual.\nDifferences in protective measured ended some relationships. <br>In what ways are boundaries, as discussed by <a data-href=\"Family Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Systems Theory</a>, may be limiting to our understanding of CNM relationships?

We aim to review key insights from research on the benefits (i.e., diversification of need fulfillment) and challenges (i.e., continued stigma) of CNM relationships and how research on CNM highlights some limitations of the existing theories of relationships.\nRecent Findings The last two decades have seen a trend towards increasing diversity of family structures. Although monogamy remains the most common relationship structure, CNM relationships are increasing in prevalence and in interest to both lay people and researchers. Recent research has begun to uncover novel insights into who is more likely to be drawn to and engage in CNM, how CNM relationships compare to monogamous relationships, and the potential benefits and challenges of engaging in CNM relationships.\nSummary While people in CNM relationships still experience stigma, for those who desire such relationships, CNM can be a viable and healthy alternative to monogamy, and may even help people meet more of their needs through diversifying need fulfillment across multiple partners. Despite this, many existing relationship theories are not inclusive of CNM relationship experiences and aspects of existing theories of positive relationships and sexuality may not extend to people in CNM relationships. Moving forward it is important to consider whether our concepts and measures are inclusive to people in diverse relationships, including those in CNM relationships. <br>Keywords: <a

There are other purposes for which theory might be constructed (Klein &amp; White, 1996; Schneider, 2006; Swedberg, 2014), but in this chapter, I will discuss theory for the purpose of explanation (Bengtson et&nbsp; al., 2005a; Fine &amp; Fincham, 2013a). Theories are created by theorizing, and theorizing is thus any process by which a researcher develops explanations. While theorizing is about understanding the world, metatheorizing is about understanding theorizing. One may distinguish three different kinds of metatheorizing (Ritzer, 1988): • Metatheorizing to summarize, interpret, and/or critique (the contents of) prior theory. • Metatheorizing to propose rules for effective theorizing. This includes textbooks on theorizing (D.&nbsp;C. Bell, 2009; Chafetz, 1978; Hage, 1972; Swedberg, 2014). • Metatheorizing to describe and evaluate methods of theorizing, largely conducted by philosophers (e.g., Godfrey-Smith, 2003; Hempel, 1965; Popper, 1965; Staley, 2014). This chapter will emphasize the third type of metatheorizing, a discussion which will naturally touch to some extent on metatheorizing of the second type.\nKeywords: In Progress\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Metatheorizing in Family Theory","level":1,"id":"Metatheorizing_in_Family_Theory_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/readings/2.-family-science-and-demography-(literature)/@bellmetatheorizingfamilytheory2022.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724755448396,"modifiedTime":1739936681872,"sourceSize":2018,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Theoretical Perspectives on the Family (HDFS 8820)/Readings/2.

In fact, a family systems perspective, or seeing the whole as greater than the sum of the individual parts, is “core” to the discipline’s identity and much of what makes family science “a unique and unified discipline.” Consequently, this chapter describes the origins of general systems and family systems theories, outlines the theory’s core assumptions and key concepts, describes three middle-range theories of note, identifies limitations of the theory, and offers suggestions for growth and expansion of systems theory. In order to demonstrate how a theoretical framework can be challenged by collectivist culture, we use empirical exemplars highlighting Asian American family science in an illustration. This endeavor seems timely given that this chapter is written during the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-Asian racism is on the rise in the United States.\n<br>Systems theory emerged in the 1920 s when <a data-href=\"Ludwig von Bertalanffy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a>, an Austrian biologist, proposed a systems approach in the production and implementation of defense systems in order to optimize efficiency, success, and network interactions.\nIn 1954, von Bertalanffy, along with biomathematician Anatol Rapoport, economist Kenneth Boulding, and physiologist Ralph Gerard founded the Society for General Systems Research.\nIn the late 1940s, independent from von Bertalanffy, Norbert Weiner, a philosopher and mathematician, tried to unite mechanists, who saw living organisms functioning like machines, and vitalists who saw little connection between laws governing living and nonliving things. Weiner (1948) contributed the principles of homeostasis and self-regulation through feedback. Before the 1900s, there were no theories dedicated to analyzing families. The concept of the family system was fundamental to Talcott Parsons’ structural functional theory, the most important paradigm in the field of sociology during the 1940s and 1950s.

According to this model, contemporary Americans are asking their marriage to help them fulﬁll different sets of goals than in the past. Whereas they ask their marriage to help them fulﬁll their physiological and safety needs much less than in the past, they ask it to help them fulﬁll their esteem and self-actualization needs much more than in the past. Asking the marriage to help them fulﬁll the latter, higher level needs typically requires sufﬁcient investment of time and psychological resources to ensure that the two spouses develop a deep bond and profound insight into each other’s essential qualities. Although some spouses are investing sufﬁcient resources—and reaping the marital and psychological beneﬁts of doing so—most are not. Indeed, they are, on average, investing less than in the past. As a result, mean levels of marital quality and personal well-being are declining over time. According to the suffocation model, spouses who are struggling with an imbalance between what they are asking from their marriage and what they are investing in it have several promising options for corrective action: intervening to optimize their available resources, increasing their investment of resources in the marriage, and asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating the fulﬁllment of spouses’ higher needs. Discussion explores the implications of the suffocation model for understanding dating and courtship, sociodemographic variation, and marriage beyond American’s borders.\nKeywords: Marriage is a means to various ends, a pathway through which people pursue certain goals. Historical changes in American marriage since the late 1700 s, the time of the nation's founding, adopting the perspective that America has witnessed three dominant models of marriage. The first, which extended from the late 1700 s until around 1850, was a practical model in which marriage was primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their economic, political, and pragmatic goals. The second, from around 1850 until around 1965, was a breadwinner-homemaker model (which included romanticized and companionate subperiods) in which marriage was primarily oriented towards helping spouses meet their passion and intimacy needs. The third, from around 1865 until today, was (and continues to be) a self-expressive model in which marriage was (and is) primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their autonomy and personal growth needs. The primary functions of marriage have ascended Abraham Maslow's (1943, 1954/1970) hierarchy of needs, which, from bottom to top, encompasses physiological needs, safety needs, belonging and love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. The Suffocation Model\nThese tenets build upon three properties of Maslow's theory of human motivation. The first property is that needs people seek to fulfill are arranged hierarchically, with lower needs typically possessing greater motivational priority than higher needs. The second is that relative to the successful pursuit of higher needs (to achieve mastery, to experience personal growth, etc.) is more likely to require self-insight, and the development of such self-insight frequently requires considerable cognitive and psychological effort over a sustained period. The third is that the fulfillment of higher needs yields especially high levels of happiness, serenity, and richness of life. One central means through which Americans seek to fulfill their needs is through their marriage, especially as their access to nonspousal significant others has declined. Since the nation's founding, the extent to which Americans look to their marriage to help them fulfill their lower needs has decreased, whereas the extent to which they look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs has increased. Just as the pursuit of higher needs frequently requires substantial insights into the self, looking to the marriage to help individuals fulfill their higher needs frequently requires that each spouse have substantial insight into the partner, and the development of such insight into the partner, and the development of such insight typically requires considerable communication and responsiveness over a sustained period. Even as Americans increasingly look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs, they have, on average, reduced their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage. In conjunction, the resource imbalance, resulting from the trends described in Tenets 2, 3, and 4 - insufficient investment to meet the emphasis on higher needs - has undermined spouses' marital quality and personal well-being (although those spouses who manage to invest sufficient resources experience especially strong marital quality and personal well-being). Spouses experiencing the adverse effects described in Tenet 5 have three general options for ameliorating or reversing these consequences: Optimizing their usage of the resources that are available\nIncreasing their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage\nAsking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating their higher needs. The contemporary American model of marriage is the product of a succession of cultural developments that altered marriage's raisons d'etre over time. These raisons d'etre shifted from: Economics, politics, and pragmatism (late 1700s to 1850)\nPassion and affection (1850 to 1965)\nSelf-expression and personal growth (1965 to the present) Burgess and Locke (1945) characterized the shift from the first to the second emphasis as a transition from institutional to companionate marriage, and Cherline (2009) characterized the shift from the second to the third emphasis as a transition from companionate to individualistic, or self-expressive, marriage. It is important to recognize that, as with biological evolution, cultural evolution is more of a tinkering process than an engineering process. <br>Sociologist Ernest Burgess characterized institutional marriages as formal institutions that were strictly regulated by law, social norms, and religion. (<a data-href=\"Institutional Marriage\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Institutional Marriage</a>) According to Burgess, farm families dominated the marital landscape prior to the last few decades of the nineteenth century. In early America, strong and stable marriages were essential to the welfare of family members and the larger community. Family members relied on one another to meet basic needs, including economic production, child care, education, and elder care. Marriage also created bonds between families that facilitated the sharing of resources. Because cohesive, stable, and interconnected families were necessary for survival, society had an interest in regulating marriage and the behavior of individual spouses. In this model, the stability of the family was more important than the needs of the individual family members. Children typically were not allowed to marry without parental permission, and divorce was unacceptable except in the most extreme cases of abuse or abandonment. The raisons d’ˆ etre of marriage were, both directly and indirectly (via broader social processes), related to lower needs in Maslow’s hierarchy. Spouses looked to their marriage to help them fulfill physiological needs such as having enough food to eat, keeping warm in the winter, and having a place to sleep in inclement weather. Spouses also looked to their marriage to help them fulfill safety needs such as being protected from violent attack, having a predictable daily existence, and maintaining a sense of economic security.\nIn many late-1700 s American communities, market economies were strengthening, which began to enable young Americans to work for wages outside their home and to settle at greater distances from their family of origin. At the same time, the influence of Protestant churches, which had historically exerted substantial control over young adults’ marital choices, was declining. These changes dovetailed with an Enlightenment-era worldview that valued the so-called natural passions, including love and romantic desire. Such economic, geographic, and philosophical developments began to reduce the influence of parental approval in marital decisions, which afforded individuals greater freedom in selecting a spouse, trends that rapidly accelerated staring around 1850. Even with the trend toward wage labor outside the home, there was still a need for someone to attend to domestic tasks. For a wife to specialize in domestic production was often efficient, especially given women’s unique biological contributions to childbearing and early childrearing, and having women adopt the homemaking role aligned with prevalent views of women as delicate, virtuous, and sensitive. As wives' labor became less central to household economic success, society shifted to sentimental reasons for marriage. \"As the new rules surrounding marriage relaxed, a new idea gained prominence: rather being based on a code of obligations to society and religion, marriage should be based on ties of affection and companionship between spouses. \" ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Suffocation of Marriage: Climbing Mount Maslow Without Enough Oxygen","level":1,"id":"The_Suffocation_of_Marriage_Climbing_Mount_Maslow_Without_Enough_Oxygen_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Marriage as a Means to Goal Fulfillment","level":2,"id":"Marriage_as_a_Means_to_Goal_Fulfillment_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"The Suffocation Model of Marriage in America\" href=\"The Suffocation Model of Marriage in America\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Suffocation Model of Marriage in America</a>","level":2,"id":"[[The_Suffocation_Model_of_Marriage_in_America]]_0"},{"heading":"Key Tenets","level":3,"id":"Key_Tenets_0"},{"heading":"Three Major Models of Marriage in America","level":2,"id":"Three_Major_Models_of_Marriage_in_America_0"},{"heading":"The Institutional Model: Agrarian Society and the Practical Marriage (Late 1700 s - 1850)","level":3,"id":"The_Institutional_Model_Agrarian_Society_and_the_Practical_Marriage_(Late_1700_s_-_1850)_0"},{"heading":"The Companionate Model (And Its Romanticized Variant): Industrialization and the Breadwinner-Homemaker Marriage (1850 - 1965)","level":3,"id":"The_Companionate_Model_(And_Its_Romanticized_Variant)_Industrialization_and_the_Breadwinner-Homemaker_Marriage_(1850_-_1965)_0"}],"links":[".html",".html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/readings/4.-theory-and-research-about-romantic-relationships/@finkelsuffocationmarriageclimbing2014.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1725821419869,"modifiedTime":1725840054589,"sourceSize":10587,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Theoretical Perspectives on the Family (HDFS 8820)/Readings/4.

The topic is framed as part of the general issue of health disparities, which involves the oft-observed positive relationship between SES and the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical well-being of adults and children. A review of recent research and theory identiﬁes three general theoretical approaches that provide possible explanations for the association between SES and individual development: the social causation, social selection, and interactionist perspectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates support for the social causation view that SES affects families and the development of children in terms of both family stress processes (the family stress model) and family investments in children (the family investment model). However, there also is empirical support for the social selection argument that individual characteristics lead to differences in SES. Especially important, recent research is consistent with an interactionist approach, which proposes a dynamic relationship between SES and developmental change over time. Drawing on the combined set of research ﬁndings, the article concludes with the description of an interactionist model that serves as a heuristic for future studies of the links among SES, parenting behaviors, and child development.\nKeywords: In Progress\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"An Interactionist Perspective on the Socioeconomic Context of Human Development","level":1,"id":"An_Interactionist_Perspective_on_the_Socioeconomic_Context_of_Human_Development_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/readings/12.-ecological-theories-and-family-stress-theories/@congerinteractionistperspectivesocioeconomic2007.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1731596367590,"modifiedTime":1731596413169,"sourceSize":2265,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/HDFS Classes/Theoretical Perspectives on the Family (HDFS 8820)/Readings/12.

(1987). Romantic Love Conceptualized as an Attachment Process. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52(3), 511–524.\nType: Journal Article\nTitle: Romantic Love Conceptualized as an Attachment Process, Author: Kazan, Cindy; Shaver, Phillip; This article explores the possibility that romantic love is an attachment process—a biosocial process by which affectional bonds are formed between adult lovers, just as affectional bonds are formed earlier in life between human infants and their parents. Key components of attachment theory, developed by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and others to explain the development of affectional bonds in infancy, were translated into terms appropriate to adult romantic love. The translation centered on the three major styles of attachment in infancy—secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent—and on the notion that continuity of relationship style is due in part to mental models (Bowlby's \"inner working models\") of self and social life. These models, and hence a person's attachment style, are seen as determined in part by childhood relationships with parents. Two questionnaire studies indicated that (a) relative prevalence of the three attachment styles is roughly the same in adulthood as in infancy, (b) the three kinds of adults differ predictably in the way they experience romantic love, and (c) attachment style is related in theoretically meaningful ways to mental models of self and social relationships and to relationship experiences with parents. Implications for theories of romantic love are discussed, as are measurement problems and other issues related to future tests of the attachment perspective.\nKeywords: Bowlby's major purpose was to describe how infants become emotionally attached to their primary caregivers and emotionally distressed when separated from them, although he also contended that 'attachment behavior [characterizes] human beings from the cradle to the grave.'\nThe purpose of this article is to explore the possibility that Attachment Theory, designed primarily with infants in mind, offers a valuable perspective on adult romantic love. For our purpose, which is to create a coherent framework for understanding love, loneliness, and grief at different points in the life cycle. Love appears to take multiple forms. They have not said how the healthy and unhealthy forms git together in a single conceptual framework. <a data-href=\"Attachment Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/attachment-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attachment Theory</a> not only provides such a framework, but it also explains how both healthy and unhealthy forms of love originate as reasonable adaptations to specific social circumstances. Attachment theory deals with separation and loss and helps explain how loneliness and love are related. Attachment theory links adult love with socioemotional processes evident in children and nonhuman primates; it places love within an evolutionary context. When a human or primate infant is separated from its mother, the infant goes through a predictable series of emotional reactions. The first is protest, which involves crying, active searching, and resistance to others' soothing efforts. The second is despair, which is a state of passivity and obvious sadness. The third, discussed only with reference to humans, is detachment, an active, seemingly defensive disregard for and avoidance of the mother if she returns. The attachment system, as Bowlby called the complex constellation of attachment feelings and behaviors seems have evolved to protect infants from danger by keeping them close to the mother. When very young, a human infant can do little more than cry, make eye context, smile, and snuggle in to encourage its mother to keep it near. Once mobile, however, it can actively pursue its mother and vocalize to her. When an infant is healthy, alert, unafraid, and in the presence of its mother, it seems interested in exploring and mastering the environment and in establishing affiliative contact with other family and community members. Researchers call this using the mother as a secure base. Attachment theory can be summarized in three propositions: The first [proposition] is that when an individual is confident that an attachment figure will be available to him whenever he desires it, that person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will an individual who for any reason has no such confidence in the availability of attachment figures, or lack of it, is built up slowly during the years of immaturity - infancy, childhood, and adolescence - and that whatever expectations are developed during those years tend to persist relatively unchanged throughout the rest of life. The third proposition concerns the role of actual experience. It postulates that the varied expectations of the accessibility and responsiveness of attachment figures that individuals develop during the years of immaturity are tolerably accurate reflections of the experiences those individuals have actually had. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 235) Ainsworth's research suggested a mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her infant's signals and needs during the first year of life are important prerequisites. Mothers who are slow or inconsistent in responding to their infant's cries or who regularly intrude on or interfere with their infant's desired activities (sometimes to force affection on the infant at a particular moment) produce infants who cry more than usual, explore less than usual (even in the mother's presence), mingle attachment behaviors with overt expressions of anger, and seem generally anxious. If, instead, the mother consistently rebuffs or rejects the infant's attempts to establish physical contact, the infant may learn to avoid her. Delineated three styles or types of attachment, often called secure, anxious/ambivalent, and avoidant. Infants in the anxious/ambivalent category frequently exhibit the behaviors Bowlby called protest, and the avoidant infants frequently exhibit the behaviors he called detachment. According to Bowlby, working models (which we will also call mental models) and the behavior patterns influenced by them are central components of personality. The claim of cross-situational and cross-age continuity is still controversial but is supported by a growing list of longitudinal studies from infancy through the early elementary school years. Continuity, according to Bowlby (1973), is due primarily to the persistence of interrelated mental models of self and social life in the context of a fairly stable family setting: \"Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: Whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection\nWhether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming.\" (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238) No one has attempted to conceptualized the entire range of romantic love experiences in a way that parallels the typology developed by Ainsworth and her colleagues. Nor has anyone with an interest in romantic relationships pursued Bowlby's idea that continuity in relationship style is a matter of mental models of self and social life. Finally, no one has explored the possibility that the specific characteristics of parent-child relationships identified by Ainsworth et al., as the probable causes of differences in infant attachment styles are also among the determinants of adults' romantic attachment styles. We expected roughly 60% of adults to classify themselves as secure and the remainder to split fairly evenly between the two insecure types, with perhaps a few more in the avoidant than in the anxious/ambivalent category. In a summary of American studies of three types of infants Campos et al., (1983) concluded that 62% are secure, 23% avoidant, and 15% are anxious/ambivalent. We predicted that the most important love experience of a secure adult would be characterized by trust, friendship, and positive emotions. For avoidant adults, love was expected to be marked by fear of closeness and lack of trust. Anxious/ambivalent adults were expected to experience love as a preoccupying, almost painfully exciting struggle to merge with another person. This last style is similar to what Hindy and Schwarz (1984) called anxious romantic attachment and Tennov (1979) called limerence. Respondents' working models of self and relationships were also expected to differ according to attachment style. Secure types should believe in enduring love, generally find others trustworthy, and have confidence that the self is likable. Avoidant types should be more doubtful of the existence or durability of romantic love and believe that they do not need a love partner in order to be happy. Anxious/ambivalent types should fall in love frequently and easily but have difficulty finding true love. They should also have more serf-doubts than the other two types because, unlike avoidant respondents, they do not repress or attempt to hide feelings of insecurity. We expected respondents of the three types to report different attachment histories.

The family's holistic quality represents the unique entity created by the combination of individual members. The parts of a system work together to create something new and distinct. (Think of a cake. When the individual ingredients are combined, they create something totally new. Each ingredient plays a unique part in the quality of the cake as they interact). In family systems, these new systems-level properties or behaviors emerge as a result of the transactions of the parts and are known as emergent properties rather than purely summative qualities Family systems are comprised of interdependent parts. When one part of the system changes, all parts will be affected. Reverberations can be felt throughout the system. Family systems are self-reflexive and self-regulating. Systems are cybernetic and utilize feedback to maintain themselves and to achieve goals. While early family systems theorists focused on families' inclinations toward homeostasis or change resistance, contemporary theorists also note adaptive changes made possible as a result of family self-regulation. Communication in human systems facilitated the family's ability to create meaning, monitor behavior and attain goals, and modify plans and future goal-directed activities based on feedback. Individual and family behavior must be understood in context. Family systems have boundaries that demarcate families from their environments, indicating who is in and out of the family system. A family receives input or 'energy, matter, and information' from its environment returns output to the environment. This interchange of inputs and outputs generates change for both the family and the environment in which it is nested. One central means through which Americans seek to fulfill their needs is through their marriage, especially as their access to nonspousal significant others has declined. Since the nation's founding, the extend to which Americans look to their marriage to help them fulfill their lower needs has decreased, whereas the extent to which they look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs has increased. Just as the pursuit of higher needs frequently requires substantial insight into the self, looking to the marriage to help individuals fulfill their higher needs frequently requires that each spouse have substantial insight into the partner, and the development of such insight typically requires considerable communication and responsiveness over a sustained period.\nEven as Americans increasingly look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs, they have, on average, reduced their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage. In conjunction, the resource imbalance resulting from the trends described in tenets 2, 3 and 4 - insufficient investment to meet the emphasis on higher needs - has undermined spouses' marital quality and personal well-being (although those spouses who manage to invest sufficient resources experience especially strong marital quality and personal well-being). Spouses experiencing the adverse effects described in Tenet 5 have 3 general options for ameliorating or reversing these consequences: optimizing their usage of the resources that are available, increasing their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage, and asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating their higher needs. Suffocation model applying to more than just romantic relationshipsFamily System TheorySuffocation of Marriage ModelCompare and contrast two theoretical or conceptual perspectives that we have discussed in class to study a research topic or question of your choice in family science. How do the theoretical assumptions, methods used, and interpretation differ for these two different approaches? Which approach seems to you to be best supported by current data? What new directions do you recommend for future research in this area?You will need to support your arguments with additional citations beyond the article we have discussed in class. The additional reading section for each week in the syllabus will provide some relevant citations, but you will also need to identify your own citations as well.&nbsp;The paper should be:\n5-7 double-spaced pages, excluding references\n12-pt font and 1-inch margins\nFollow APA 7 format. Abraham Maslow, a psychologist, developed a 'Hierarchy of Needs' framework to show human potential (1943). He argues that a human being cannot achieve 'self-actualization' at the top of the hierarchy without having first met his needs at the lower levels. Bennet &amp; Shangreaux (2005) 'Physiological' Needs These needs that are the most dominant of all needs. The human being who is missing everything in life in an extreme fashion is most likely motivated to meet his physiological needs first, before turning his energy and attention to others needs. Safety Needs A human being requires a sense of safety in society wherein he feels protected. Love Needs Love, affection, and sense of belongingness in order to feel complete. A human being requires a family, friends, and sense of belonging in order to feel complete. Esteem Needs Human beings have a need or desire for self-respect and self-esteem, or a high evaluation of themselves. Human beings are motivated by the need to avhieve and the desire for freedom, independence, strength, mastery, and confidence in the face of the world. Human kind is also motivated by the need to be respected by other people, by a desire for reputation or prestige, recognition, attention, importance, and appreciation. Satisfying the self-esteem need leads to feelings of self-confidence and self-worth, while thwarting these needs produces feelings of inferiority and helplessness. Self-Actualization Need Self-actualization is a desire for self-fulfillment, a desire to be all that a person can potentially be.
