- The ethical principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.
	- [[Respect for Persons]]:![[Respect for Persons]]
	- [[Beneficence]]:![[Beneficence]]
	- [[Justice]]:![[Justice]]
- Balancing the Three Principles:
	- According to the [[Belmont Report]], "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
	- In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit)
- Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects:
	- The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the [[Belmont Report]]: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. 
		- Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review:
			- IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following:
				1. Risks to subjects are minimized:
					- By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
					- Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. 
				2. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. 
					- In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.
				3. Selection of subjects is equitable. 
					- In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons).
				4. Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. 
				5. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. 
				6. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. 
				7. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. 
				8. For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations:
					- Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. 
					- Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. 
					- If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. 
	- When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. 
	- Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the [[Belmont Report]].
