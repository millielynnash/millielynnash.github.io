Friendship processes control the effectiveness and thresholds of the repair of problematic interaction. Couple's construction of a 'shared meaning system' facilitates stability and happiness.

Discernment counseling ends with a decision to take one of three paths: Couple therapy\nDivorce\nStatus Quo Could be up to 30% of couples who come to therapy, but our models and techniques do not prepare us for these types of couples (one is leaning in the other leaning out).\nThese types of couples are difficult to treat because of their conflicting goals for therapy. One to say it is worth investing in the relationship and we can fix the problems, the other perhaps to prove that we have done all we can it is time to split. Doherty believed that before trying to do any sort of couple work, these couples needed to decide if that is what they wanted. Short term processes: 1-5 sessions\nGoal is to get a deeper understanding of what has happened in the relationship and each partner's contributions to the problems. Three paths: Status quo\nDivorce\nTherapy Couple together\nOne spouse separately\nSummary to the other spouse\nOne spouse separately\nSummary to the other spouse\nCouple together <br>Not much research on <a data-href=\"Mixed-Agenda Couples\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a> couples and how to work with them. Most work suggests that <a data-href=\"Mixed-Agenda Couples\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a> couples are common (about 30%). Outcome research is sparse but suggest that these couples when treated with couple therapy are more likely to separate. Also evidence that people going through the divorce process believe the marriage could be saved (about 26%) and are interested in reconciliation services (about 33%).\nLots of evidence of ambivalence about the divorce and the relationship. About 66.2% of folks in the divorce process were sure they wanted the divorce, 16.5% had mixed feelings, and 9.8% would consider reconciliation. Conclusion: We need some way of providing services to folks considering divorce to help them with their mixed feelings and decide on a path. 100 cases evaluated 97 heterosexual couples, 3 same-sex\nMarried an average of 15.5 years\nHighly distressed based on the DAS short form\n51% had consulted a divorce attorney\nWell educated\n48% came based on self-referral, 34% from therapists or social service agencies, 11% from attorneys or judges. Findings: Average number of sessions 3.61\n47% decided on path 3 (therapy), 41% separation/divorce, and 12% status quo. Contact with a divorce attorney associated with a lower likelihood of path 3, and higher likelihood of path 2. At follow-up, those who chose path 2: 90% were divorced or in the process, one couple reconciled, and 3 were on hold. Those who chose path 3: 36% reconciled, 6% in process, 28% had divorced, 17% were in process of divorce, and 13% were on hold. Ask what they understand about discernment counseling. For the leaning-out partner: Make sure they feel heard and that they understand the process of discernment and that it is different than couple therapy then ask if they are still seeking some sort of clarity on the process of divorce, and how confident they are in their decision. For the leaning-in partner: They recommend they read 'The Divorce Remedy by Michele Weiner-Davis', which provides advice for folks who have just found out their partner wants a divorce. Recommended that you contact both partners separately for these intake conversations. Block out 2 hours for the first session. Meet together to ask questions, meet with each partner separately, provide summaries to the partners after each individual session, then come back together to summarize the set of sessions, therapist's impressions of the couple, then if both partners agree, schedule the second session. Questions for both: What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility? Can you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?\nWhat role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?\nCan you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy? Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first): Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. (Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)\nAsk them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement. Now work with the leaning-in partner: Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. Summary statement: Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. Goals: Clarity\nConfidence\nMore understanding 90-minute sessions: Time together\nTime separately with summaries\nTime together wrap-up Check-in: 3 goals: Learning where each partner is in their discernment process\nReminding partners of the goals of discernment\nAcoiding an open-ended invitation to talk about the relationship problems. Leaning-out partner: Move to help them see their contributions Leaning-In partner: Move to help them develop a plan for change Discernment is not the same for both partners, leaning in partner carries a bigger burden of leadership about what they may need to change in order for the marriage to be more viable. Summaries should become more self-revealing and intense, therapist feedback can also be more in-depth in terms of positives and negatives. Need to prepare partners for the work that will need to be done in therapy. If you are going to be the couple therapist have a transition session possibly using the Agreement to Pursue Reconciliation Form (pg. 103). Generate personal agendas for change (pg. 105) and have them share with each other. Explore the divorce decision: Freedom\nRelief\nPainful letting go Deal with the emotional fall-out of the decision\nPrepare couple for a constructive divorce process in their interactions with each other, in their dealings with their children, and in choosing professional assistance. Offer more sessions about a constructive divorce process. Monitor the emotions and although emphasizing with each partner interrupt intense emotional outpourings from leaning-in partner, keep things as calm as possible. In your summary, state any commonalities you have heard about their divorce hopes and dreams for their children, co-parenting, and their interest in mediation and collaborative divorce processes. Why couples may choose this path: Leaning-out partner still can't decide and leaning-in partner is still leaning-in. The couple may have gotten enough from the session (relief, able to talk more calmly about the issues, feel heard for the first time, etc.) so they feel ready to continue the relationship without more therapy. It may also be it doesn't seem like the right time for a big change in their lives (considering their children or other situations).\nSome believe that situations that are impinging on their relationship might change so they decide to wait it out.

It is probably more common to see couples who do not have diagnosable disorders but have complaints about the sexual aspects of their relationships. The most common problem is desire discrepancy.

It is for individuals that struggle with sexual disorders/dysfunctions. Therapist directed or structured. You can collaborate, but the therapist is not coming up with their own examples. Related to practicing activities learned in sessions and other behaviors that are carefully crafted and explained during the session. Expected to facilitate a therapeutic effect. Need to be practical. Practiced in small increments toward a goal (typically not erection, penetration, or orgasm). Major goal is to reduce anxiety and reinforce new behavior. Need to be relevant to the issues, and within the ability of the client or couple. Make the assignment (perhaps in writing as well) and then work with the couple and what they think about the assignment, ay questions they have and any fears ,, they have about starting the assignment. Collaborate so that the clients are invested and the assignment is tailored to them. Negotiate the schedule, who initiates, and make sure they clearly understand what they are supposed to do. Process the assignment the next session, what worked, what didn't, etc. Access effort. Most effective evidence-based practices in combination with psychotherapy. For sex therapy, it includes information about sexual functioning, sexual disorders, sexual orientation, gender diversity, STI’s.

Incorporates psychoeducation about the sexual response and a series of incremental physical exercises performed outside of the therapeutic setting. Viewed as a form of desensitization intended to promote relaxation, communication and attention to physical sensations of touch, and the physical emotional connections between partners. Combined with mindfulness (being present in the moment, not thinking about past or future; making no judgements, not spectating). Authors use a more systemic approach to sensate focus then originally designed. They include both partners, and create smaller increments of behaviors moving toward genital touch then Masters and Johnson. 9 functions of sensate focus: Become more aware of sensations\nFocus solely on one's own needs for pleasure\nCommunicate sensual and sexual needs, wishes and desires\nIncrease awareness of partner's sensual and sexual needs\nExpand the repertoire of intimate touch, sensual and sexual behaviors\nLearn to appreciate foreplay or touch as an end in itself rather than a means to an end\nCreate positive relationship experiences\nBuild sexual desire\nEnhance the level of love, caring, commitment, intimacy cooperation, and sexual interest in the relationship Describe what is involved, noting each partner's reaction (see questions on page 183) What is 'good enough' sex? Go slowly if one or both partners express hesitation or ambivalence or simple refusal. Tailored to the specific needs of the couple. The 'goal' of the exercise is the touch and the experience of the sensations, not erection, orgasm, penetration, etc.\nSpecific assignments should occur weekly, so assignments can be reviewed and revised. Remind couples that this is a chance to rebuild physical and emotional intimacy and there is no hurry. Couple is instructed to avoid intercourse and any activity that is sexual. The idea is to create a non-demand atmosphere. (reducing performance anxiety, increasing pleasurable encounters).\nCreate a sensual environment. Partners are both givers and receivers (regardless of the <a data-href=\"Identified Patient (IP)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/identified-patient-(ip).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Identified Patient (IP)</a>)\nGradually build, first touch in general, no genital touch, with and without clothing to focus on sensations from touch, coach them to talk about what they like and what they want/need. During each session the giver listens to the receiver. The receiver progresses to being present (mindful) during the exercise only. Review the assignment at the next session (questions on page 187)\nOnce the couple is comfortable with nonsexual touch, move to erotic and genital touch, again in small increments. The goal is for the couple to experience sexual stimulation as a goal in itself. If desired, then the couple can move to intercourse (no pressure). This can also be done in gradual steps.

CBCT is a good example to help couples. Couples need to focus on emotions rather than logical thoughts that keep them stuck in their cycle.

Sexual Mythology: Misguided beliefs, misconceptions, and distortions that promote unrealistic standards and rigid expectations. Faculty Cognitions: These can be engrained and automatic.

While legally informed programs can offer mediation, these services can miss the underlying conflict that continues to plague postseparation couple relationships and, more importantly, their children. Divorce is a process with multiple transitions for a family, and the couples who separate or divorce may have a history of negative communication patterns that have long corroded their relationship. There is a need to develop a new coparenting relationship that can serve as a foundation for the long-term. The research literature varies in understanding the impact of divorce on children, but there is consistent agreement that parental conflict does affect child maladjustment. Emotionally focused therapy (EFT) is one effective means of working with a couple who are separated or divorced. EFT is an empirically supported couples’ treatment that was developed from attachment, emotion, and systems theories. This article explores the use of Stage 1 of EFT for couples who are separated or divorced, using a case example to further illustrate the model.\nKeywords: Need to Read\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Use of Emotionally Focused Therapy with Separated or Divorced Couples","level":1,"id":"The_Use_of_Emotionally_Focused_Therapy_with_Separated_or_Divorced_Couples_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@allanuseemotionallyfocused2016.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1717424510179,"modifiedTime":1724752433587,"sourceSize":1638,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Couples (HDFS 8876)/Readings/@allanUseEmotionallyFocused2016.md","exportPath":"couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@allanuseemotionallyfocused2016.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@armenticonjointtreatmentintimate2016.html":{"title":"@armentiConjointTreatmentIntimate2016","icon":"","description":"\nBibliography: Armenti, N.

This review outlines current U.S. state-mandated treatments for IPV, acknowledges how conjoint treatment may better address a subtype of IPV that is not motivated by power and control, examines and reviews previously conducted couples-based treatments, and highlights policy implications and future directions. Empirical ﬁndings and theoretical support for the Duluth model, cognitive– behavioral approaches, and IPV typologies are presented, followed by a systematic review of selected quasi- and true experimental studies on couplesbased approaches for IPV. U.S. state guidelines that absolutely exclude conjoint approaches are overly restrictive, considering the poor evidence of effectiveness for current gender-speciﬁc groups. Further, the theoretical foundations of most men-only groups assume unilateral, male-to-female violence, which does not ﬁt at least one-third of court-involved cases and leaves treatment needs of couples experiencing problematic relationship dynamics unmet. For a carefully screened subset of couples that experience predominantly “situational violence,” conjoint communication and relationship skills training groups may be a viable alternative to the Duluth model and cognitive–behavioral men-only groups.\n<br>Keywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:IPV\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#IPV\">#IPV</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Domestic-Violence\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Domestic-Violence\">#Domestic-Violence</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Battering-Intervention\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Battering-Intervention\">#Battering-Intervention</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Conjoint-Treatment\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Conjoint-Treatment\">#Conjoint-Treatment</a> <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Situational-Violence\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Situational-Violence\">#Situational-Violence</a> \"Some U.S. state guidelines are so restrictive that they appear to prohibit anything except a Duluth model intervention.\" (p. 109) \"No true experiments have found the Duluth model to be effective.\" (pg. 109) \"The intervention piece of the Duluth model has minimal impact on reducing recidivism over and above the effect of arrest and probation alone.\" (p. 110)\n\"Psychologists tried to improve men's group outcomes by incorporating cognitive-behavioral techniques known to be effective in treating other externalizing behaviors, including anger and substance abuse issues.\" (p. 110) \"The outcome statistics on these cognitive-behavioral men-only groups are disappointing, comparable with those of the Duluth model men's group.\" (p. 110) \"No single current battering intervention modality outperforms any other and there is room for improvement in adequately reducing IPV recidivism.\" (p. 110)\nPrimary Goal of Journal Article: \"The primary aim of this review is to introduce the potential utility of conjoint intervention as an alternative approach to both Duluth model and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions for a certain subset of intimate partner abusers.\"\n\"Reviewed studies included treatment conditions in which both members of a couple experiencing IPV were involved in direct intervention and follow-up measures obtained from a combination of victims only, both victims and perpetrators or conviction reports.\" \"Beginning in the 1980s, the Duluth model men’s groups were implemented as a deferred-adjudication intervention, prompted by judges so that the influx of new arrests for IPV did not overwhelm jails and prisons.\" (p. 110)\n\"The Duluth model was based on ideology and field-based interviewing rather than scientific testing.\" (p. 110)\n\"The Duluth model creators developed the “power and control wheel,” which conceptualizes IPV as one form of abuse to maintain male privilege.\" (p. 110)<br>\n<img alt=\"Duluth Power and Control Wheel.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/duluth-power-and-control-wheel.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe primary objective is to abandon authoritarian relationships and achieve effective forms of behavior that fall on the “equality wheel,” which fosters an egalitarian mindset within relationships.

(p. 111)\nSurvey data from a national longitudinal sample suggested reciprocal or bilateral violence, with both partners perpetuating violence against each other, occurs in \u000350% of U.S. couples reporting IPV, while another study suggested that the rate of couples experiencing bidirectional violence is as high as 60%. (p. 112)\nTreatment approaches that assume unilateral, male-to-female violence may not address a significant portion of the types of problems that couples present with when seeking treatment. (p. 112) First called Patriarchal Terrorism then to Intimate Partner Terrorism and then to Coercive Controlling Violence Patriarchal terrorism exemplifies men’s systematic use of control tactics against women, which can include violence but also economic subordination, isolation, and threats. (p. 112)\nBoth men and women can perpetuate. (p. 112)\nThis involves severe forms of severe forms of violence with a goal of dominating or controlling one's partner, and is often fueled by positive attitudes about violence in general. (p. 112)\nCoercive controlling violence is also a hallmark feature of the later coined term 'characterological violence.' (p. 112) A perpetrator of predominantly characterological violence is likely to be violent in all intimate relationships. (p. 112) Common Couple Violence (to Situational Couple Violence) Common couple violence was created to serve as a gender-neutral term, and is thought to result from relationship conflict that leads to violence, rather than patriarchic motivations related to control. (p. 112)\nCommon couple violence, a label that potentially minimized the seriousness of the problem, was changed to situational couple violence. (p. 112)\nSituational violence includes behavior such as pushing, grabbing, and slapping, and typically occurs with lower frequency. This type of violence is not motivated by underlying desires to dominate and control one’s partner, but rather occurs as a result of situational stressors within a relationship that are repeatedly remedied by using violence as a problem-solving strategy. (p. 112)\nThe manifestation of recurring, bilateral IPV is usually sustained by interactive and dyadic factors, such as distorted emotions, thoughts, and beliefs among intimate partners. Such factors contribute to relationship dysfunction associated with bilateral IPV, and situational violence is its most common form. (p. 112)\nFor couples that experience situational violence, the violence may stop when partners enter new relationships with less volatile partners. (p. 112)\nCharacterological violence is characterized by a pathological desire for power and control, but even levels of coercive control may fall on a continuum. (p. 112) Appropriateness for conjoint treatment will vary depending on levels of coercive violence, and whether characterological or situational features dominate the overall picture of violence. (p. 113) Female victims of violence who had participated in conjoint therapy said that they often felt intimated or afraid in therapy and refrained from sharing these feelings with their therapists. (p. 113)\nVictim blaming is always a possibility in the context of court-mandated interventions. Men sent to jail or to any type of mandated intervention often blame their female partners for putting them in such a situation. (p. 113)\nPlacing partner-violent men in a group setting can in actuality offer justification from other group members that beliefs about using violence in intimate partner relationships is acceptable. (p. 113) Failure to address dyadic conflict that occurs in relationships may contribute to further perpetration of violence, instead of protect individuals from it. (p. 113)\nTo date, eight studies have tested couples approaches for addressing IPV. (p. 113) One study concluded that conjoint interventions for IPV can be used safely, at least if they are used in conjunction with probation, and especially for couples with alcohol problems. (p. 113)\nResults from two studies showed that BCT lowered IPV in alcoholic men from 60% to 24% for men who continued to drink following treatment and to 12% for men who abstained from alcohol following treatment. (p. 114) Women who were victims of intimate terrorism/characterological violence would not—and should not—attend conjoint groups. To carefully and systematically designate which couples would be appropriate for conjoint treatment, researchers have created and validated the Situational Violence Screening Tool (SVST). (p. 118) Both men and women are interviewed to rule out controlling behavior, fear, severe abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, and antisocial and borderline personality disorder features. (p. 118) Validated screening tools are a critical first step for identifying situationally violent couples for whom conjoint interventions may be particularly effective. (p. 118)\nCreating Healthy Relationships Program (CHRP) The CHRP is a 22-week multi-couple group program that focuses primarily on skills including effective conflict management and creating a shared meaning within the relationship. This program is based on the sound relationship house theory, which emphasizes factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction and longevity in committed relationships.\n<br><a data-href=\"The Sound Relationship House.jpg\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Sound Relationship House.jpg</a> ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Conjoint treatment for intimate partner violence: A systematic review and implications.","level":1,"id":"Conjoint_treatment_for_intimate_partner_violence_A_systematic_review_and_implications._0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Paper Summary for Discussion","level":2,"id":"Paper_Summary_for_Discussion_0"},{"heading":"Introduction","level":3,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"The Duluth Model","level":3,"id":"The_Duluth_Model_0"},{"heading":"Cognitive-Behavior Approaches","level":3,"id":"Cognitive-Behavior_Approaches_0"},{"heading":"Johnson's Typologies of IPV","level":3,"id":"Johnson's_Typologies_of_IPV_0"},{"heading":"Criticisms of Conjoint Interventions","level":3,"id":"Criticisms_of_Conjoint_Interventions_0"},{"heading":"Evidence for Conjoint Interventions","level":3,"id":"Evidence_for_Conjoint_Interventions_0"},{"heading":"Intervention for Situational Violence: Creating Healthy Relationships Program","level":3,"id":"Intervention_for_Situational_Violence_Creating_Healthy_Relationships_Program_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:IPV","?query=tag:Domestic-Violence","?query=tag:Battering-Intervention","?query=tag:Conjoint-Treatment","?query=tag:Situational-Violence","therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0",".html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@armenticonjointtreatmentintimate2016.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["media/school-diagrams/duluth-power-and-control-wheel.png"],"createdTime":1716934231933,"modifiedTime":1724752433590,"sourceSize":11920,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Couples (HDFS 8876)/Readings/@armentiConjointTreatmentIntimate2016.md","exportPath":"couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@armenticonjointtreatmentintimate2016.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@dohertydiscernmentcounselingmixed2016.html":{"title":"@dohertyDiscernmentCounselingMixed2016","icon":"","description":"\nBibliography:\nType: Journal Article\nTitle: Discernment Counseling for “Mixed‐Agenda” Couples, Author: Doherty, William J.; Harris, Steven M.; Wilde, Jason L.; Journal: Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, Volume: 42,\nIssue: 2\nPages: 246-255\nYear: 2016 DOI: 10.1111/jmft.12132\nISSN: 0194-472X, 1752-0606\nThis article describes discernment counseling, an approach to working with couples where one partner is leaning toward divorce and the other wants to preserve the relationship and work on it in couples therapy.

From an EFT perspective, sexual functioning is viewed within the context of an attachment bond, but sexual satisfaction in EFT has not been empirically tested. We examined self-reported sexual satisfaction across 24 months in a sample of 32 couples who received an average of 21 EFT sessions. We found that sexual satisfaction increased across six time points from pre to post therapy and across follow-up (6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and that decreases in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy predicted increases in sexual satisfaction across time. These findings provide evidence that EFT may help couples improve their sexual satisfaction by reducing attachment avoidance in therapy.\nKeywords: Need to Read “While happy couples attribute 15–20% of their happiness in the relationship to a satisfying sex life, couples in distressed relationships attribute 50–70% of their distress to sexual problems” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 1) (Potential Question: With your couples at the clinic, do you often discuss the role of sex in the relationship?

We also found that reductions in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy significantly predicted higher sexual satisfaction across time points, suggesting that reductions in attachment avoidance (as facilitated through EFT) may be an important factor toward improving sexual satisfaction for couples over the long term. These results also suggest that attachment avoidance may play a significant role in the sexual relationship of distressed couples, and may have value as a target of change to improve sexual satisfaction for these couples.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 17)","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Attachment Change in Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy and Sexual Satisfaction Outcomes in a Two-year Follow-up Study","level":1,"id":"Attachment_Change_in_Emotionally_Focused_Couple_Therapy_and_Sexual_Satisfaction_Outcomes_in_a_Two-year_Follow-up_Study_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Introduction","level":2,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Sexual Satisfaction and Relationship Satisfaction","level":2,"id":"Sexual_Satisfaction_and_Relationship_Satisfaction_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@wiebeattachmentchangeemotionally2019.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1716170900297,"modifiedTime":1724752433598,"sourceSize":19107,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Couples (HDFS 8876)/Readings/@wiebeAttachmentChangeEmotionally2019.md","exportPath":"couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@wiebeattachmentchangeemotionally2019.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"couples-(hdfs-8876)/@dohertyhelpingcouplesbrink2017.html":{"title":"@dohertyHelpingCouplesBrink2017","icon":"","description":"\nBibliography: Doherty, W.

These are couples in which one spouse is seriously considering divorce and is reluctant to try couples therapy (but does show up for the first session) while the other spouse wants to preserve the marriage and is eager to start couples therapy. We refer to the first spouse as leaning-out and the second as leaning in. <br><a data-href=\"Discernment Counseling\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/discernment-counseling.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Discernment Counseling</a> creates a holding environment for the couple to develop clarity and confidence in deciding on the next step for their relationship, whether it is divorce or a shared commitment to couples therapy to repair the relationship. Proceeding with standard couple assessment and intervention risks alienating the leaning-out spouse who is resistant or ambivalent about doing therapy. Holding back from starting couples therapy risks alienating the leaning-in partner who is ready to go and may be desperate to stabilize a rocky marriage. Sometimes the divergent goals do not become clear until near the end of the first session after the therapist has done an initial assessment and outlined a provisional treatment plan. The therapist may fall into one of two traps: Trying to talk the leaning-out spouse into trying therapy for a number of sessions. This can put you into an alliance with the leaning-in spouse who may have been insisting they try couples therapy. In doing so, you risk pursuing the distancer, a strategy that works poorly in marriage and therapy. Sometimes the leaning-out spouse reluctantly goes along with, say, a contract for 3 months of couples therapy as an experiment to see whether things can change. But typically this spouse is not invested personally in the therapy; the burden falls on the leaning-in spouse to start making meaningful changes that will satisfy the other partner's desire to see progress. The therapy starts out unbalanced, with one customer or change agent and one observer or evaluator. Although trying to persuade an ambivalent spouse to try couples therapy is better than giving up on the marriage, it carries two risks that discernment counseling aims to avoid: allying with one partner and starting half-hearted couples therapy. Witholding any intervention plan until the couple is clear about their goals. Although they may believe this is a neutral stance, it ends up siding with the leaning-out spouse by offering nothing to deal with the impasse presented by competing agendas - in effect, saying to the leaning-in partner, \"I can't help you with your marriage unless your spouse agrees to try.\"\nAnother version of giving up is to try to get the leaning-in spouse to hear the reluctance of the other partner to stay in the marriage and then to accept the inevitability of divorce. Either way, the therapist distances themselves from the couple's dilemma by offering no meaningful way to deal with their differences over where to take the relationship. Some therapists work with mixed-agenda couples by offering several conjoint assessment sessions before making a decision on therapy or divorce. This approach is not in the category of a trap (because it does not create an alliance with one spouse), but it does involve the tactical mistake of seeing both spouses together in the room for this assessment and consensus building. The central problem is that this approach misses the reality that the decision to stay or leave is first an individual one, a personal choice made by each partner. The decision is best pursued in individual conversations with the therapist (the discernment counseling approach) rather than in conjoint sessions in which there is likely to be pressure to conform or resist. Having both spouses in the room for open-ended exploration invites the partners to share everything the think and feel in front of each other - a risky proposition in the face of possible rejection and divorce. Doing pre-therapy assessment primarily with both partners together in the room often leads to either painful disclosures with little immediate chance for healing because there is no contract for therapy, or to withholding and playing safe, which can lead to paralysis, after which someone announces that therapy is not working. <br>The discernment counseling protocol was inspired by <a data-href=\"Betty Carter\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Betty Carter</a>, who developed (but never published) an original way to work with mixed-agenda couples. There are two key insights. The first was that couples who are divided on whether to stay together bring such different needs and agendas to couples therapy that they should each be worked with separately, in individual conversations. The therapist helps the leaning-out spouse make a decision on whether to divorce or stay and work on the marriage. The therapist helps the leaning-in spouse bring their best self forward to try to save the marriage. The second key insight was that both spouses can tolerate knowing that the therapist is helping the other with a different, and seemingly competing, agenda. Discernment counseling became something more formal and public beginning in 2008, with Doherty and Bruce Peterson, a family court judge who was interesting in how many couples in the divorce process were open to reconciliation. Judge Peterson used two analogies: Filing for divorce is like getting on a superhighway with no exit ramps or rest stops, and it is also like having a trap door open and falling down a chute that leads to only one destination. Findings found that 30% of spouses in the divorce process (measured at the individual level) expressed interest in reconciliation services, and in 10% of couples, both partners independently expressed that interest. Discernment counseling was the term coined because the goal was for couples to work through the complexities of their situation and decide on a future direction for their marriage. (the term counseling is used deliberately to distinguish the approach from what people think of as problem-solving, relationship-improving couples therapy). Discernment counseling is a short-term process (one to five sessions) with the goal of greater clarity and confidence in the decision about a direction for the marriage, based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and each partner's contribution to the problems. It is not intended for cases in which one partner has made a final decision to divorce and simply wants a venue to convince their spouse to accept the decision. The immediate decision is whether to carve out a 6-month period of all-out effort in couples therapy to restore the marriage to health, with divorce off the table during that time. At the end of 6 months, they can reopen the decision about divorce on the basis of what they have learned about the prospect of successfully rebuilding their marriage. Therapy aims for improvement in the relationship (e.g., increased intimacy, decreased toxic conflict), whereas discernment counseling aims for clarity and confidence about a next step. The goal of discernment counseling is not to solve marriage problems but to see whether they can be solved.\nThere is no relationship homework for couples in discernment counseling, no teaching of skills during sessions, and no enactments of deeper ways to connect.\nIf clients ask for ways to manage their problems during discernment counseling, we use a 'restraint from change' approach by reminding them that relationship change should not be expected during discernment counseling. Path 1: The marraige as it has been: the status quo, neither divorce nor working in therapy to improve the relationship. Path 2: Separation or divorce Path 3: A 6-month commitment to couples therapy (and sometimes other forms of help, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, or individual therapy) with divorce off the table and with the possibility of putting divorce back on the table at the end of the 6 months. The idea behind path 3 is to move beyond amibalence about working on change and see whether it is possible to put the marriage into a place that would be good for both partners.\nPath 3, as we emphasize repeatedly, involves each partner developing a personal agenda for change on the basis of a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and their role in the problems. An advantage of framing the immediate outcomes as paths is that it moves clients past the dichotomous choice between staying together or breaking-up. The therapist too can support the idea that something has to change - the marriage cannot continue as it has been. So sometimes the discernment process begins with agreements instead of disagreement - something has to change; the old ways of being married is no longer viable. Implicitly we are saying that divorce is not a failure in this process; it is simply one of the options to be explored in a serious way, even thought only one spouse is actively considering it. Sometimes it has taken years to build up the courage to put divorce on the table in a chronically distressed marriage. Path 3 avoids the 'in or out' conundrum by offering a provisional commitment to work hard on the relationship for a period, with divorce not an option for this period but something that can be revisited later if things do not change enough. Most of the work occurs in separate conversations with each spouse, with carefully orchestrated sharing of take-home messages from the individual conversations. The flow of the sessions goes this way: Time with the couple together\nMeeting with one spouse alone (the other goes to the waiting room)\nThe other spouse returns and the first spouse summarizes key learning from the individual conversation Meeting with the second spouse alone\nThe second spouse shares learning from that conversation A check out with both spouses during which time the therapist shares reflections on the process thus far. The majority of the time is with each partner alone. Times when both parties are together in the room are carfully orchestrated to minimize demoralizing exchanges and to maximize the focus on what each is learning about themselves in the process, rather than what each wants the other to change. The individual conversations have both similar and different areas of focus for the leaning-in and leaning-out partners. similar themes are helping each better understand the dynamics of the relationship (their relational dance), their individual contributions to the problems, and how these relational and personal issues could be addressed in couples therapy (and sometimes with other helping resources). In terms of different themes, the therapist helps the leaning-out spouse figure out which path to take on the basis of an exploration of the sources of the person’s pain and discouragement about the prospect of change. The focus is on making a decision that has integrity for one’s self and others on the basis of a deeper understanding of self and the marriage and how the problems could be addressed in couples therapy if that is the chosen direction. The limit of five sessions, although not immutable, creates an expectation of intense work within a limited time frame. Going on much longer also makes it difficult for the couple not to expect relationship change and for the therapist to not lapse into doing couple interventions.\nWe say one to five sessions and not five sessions because clients are asked each time about whether they want to do an additional session up to five. some people are emotionally flat when their spouse is in the room and then liven up when our one-to-one time begins. There has been strikingly little clinical literature on how to work with these couples. One study recommended slowing down the decision-making process about divorce and then negotiating for a number of therapy sessions. No research study offered a detailed protocol for working with mixed-agenda couples or an evaluation of the approach the author used. A big part of this approach is helping clients see the difference between traditional marital therapy and discernment counseling and allowing them to indicate their willingness to engage in the process.\n<br>We are also interested in knowing exactly what the couple knows about <a data-href=\"Discernment Counseling\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/discernment-counseling.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Discernment Counseling</a> and what they hope to get out of a discernment counseling experience. The clients must leave the conversation with an understanding that the goal for discernment counseling is to help them gain greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage. If your practice has a website, include a page describing discernment counseling so potential clients can educate and even screen themselves before calling to set up the first appointment. We pay specific attention to whether they are currently living together and the status of any legal proceedings associated with divorce, including whether anyone has consulted with a lawyer. If so, do they have the lawyers on retainer, and how far along are they in the legal divorce process?\nAfter collecting some basic information over the phone, we typically ask something such as, \"Can you tell me a bit about your current situation and how do you think it might be helpful to your situation?\" It is recommended to ask them how they heard of discernment counseling. Knowing this source may also provide clues about how far into the formal divorce process they are. We listen specifically for which member of the couple is leaning-out of the relationship. Leaning-out partners often play a key role in determining whether couples come in at all for a first session. It is important that leaning-out partners feel heard and that they understand how this process is different from anything they have tried as a couple before. It is also important to assess whether leaning-out partners have made a decision to divorce or are open to the work of discernment. The following questions can be helpful in determining this: \"Would you say that you've made your decision about the future of your marriage or are you still seeking some level of clarity in this process?\"\nIf they report that they have made a decision, you can ask about their level of confidence in the decision: \"How confident are you that you're making the right decision?\" Those who call you will still be seeking some level of clarity in their decision making. They may say they are 'pretty sure' they want a divorce but feel they need to go through this process just to be 'sure,' or they may feel they 'owe it to' their partner, their marriage, or even their children. Both of these situations represent an appropriate use of the discernment counseling model. For those leaning-out partners who indicate they know they want a divorce and would like to use the session to 'break the news' to their partner, or for those who say they do not know how to tell their partner, you can inform them that this is not consistent with the goals of discernment counseling. You might respond in the following manner: \"It may be that discernment counseling is not exactly a good fit for what you want to do. The goals of discernment counseling are to help people get a greater sense of clarity and confidence in their decision making about a direction for the future of their marriage based on a better understanding of what happened to the marriage to get it to the brink of divorce and each person's role in that. If you're hoping for a different outcome, like helping your spouse understand why you want a divorce, discernment counseling is not appropriate for your situation.\" For those who ultimately want to help to annouce their divorce intentions, you can point them to other services such as divorce mediation or 'closure counseling.' When talking with the leaning-in partner at the intake, you should gather their perspective on the current situation in the marriage. Usually, the leaning-in partner makes it clear that they want to preserve the marriage, but if not, ask that question directly. Often the leaning-in partner is desperate to do something, anything, to save the marriage. In these situations, you can suggest that they purchase and begin reading Michele Weiner-Davis's (2002) book, The Divorce Remedy. They learn that they must first look at themselves and their own behavior before the marriage can get to a healthier place. You might use the following language to make this recommendation: \"Her book is written specifically for people who have recently found out that their spouse is considering divorce. She gives some practical advice on how you can act toward your partner at this stage of the process. There are probably things you can be working on that will make the situation somewhat better without making your partner feel as though he or she is committing to working on the relationship. This approach may be your best option at the moment.\" We cannot emphasize enough the value of respecting client autonomy during this process. Never assume that both parties are equally interested in attending discernment counseling. Discernment counseling is a way of meeting both parties where they are and not privileging one person's agenda over the other. \"It is really important that your spouse feel as though they have a choice in whether to come to discernment counseling. If he or she feels forced into it, it won't go well and will likely contribute to more estrangement from you on their part. \" Never assume that because one spouse has told you about something that has been happening in the relationship, the other spouse knows about it. The intake conversation must be conducted one on one, without the person's partner or anyone else in the room. The person on the intake phone call has to be able to speak freely about their perspective on the problems they are having and the struggles they are experiencing making a decision regarding the future of their marriage. \"Are you in a place that you can speak freely without interruptions?\" If there is noise or other distractions, you may want to suggest a different time or place for the call. You also should ascertain whether the client has told their spouse about discernment counseling. \"Have you discussed discernment counseling with your spouse? What do you think is his or her level of interest in participating? Does your spouse know that you and I are speaking today?\" Avoid the temptation to speak to one partner right after the other for the sake of convenience. It is probably worth taking the time at the phone intake to ensure that no one is feeling forced into having this conversation. There is also benefit to suggesting that the first partner you speak with explain to their partner that they have spoken with a discernment counselor and that if the spouse is interested, they can e-mail or phone the counselor to set up an interview. In no case should you cold call the other partner, who may not be aware of the initial contact from the spouse. Consider using the following script as a guide to the initiator of the phone call: \"It sounds like discernment counseling is appropriate for your situation according to what you've told me. The next step is for your partner and me to chat about their take on the situation and whether they are interested in discernment counseling. What might be a good idea for you is to tell your partner that we talked today, and point her to the website that describes discernment counseling. Further, you can tell them that if they are interested in doing this work, they can contact me directly and we can have a similar conversation to the one you and I just had. What is important here is that no one feels coerced to be part of this process. By putting the ball squarely in their court, they can demonstrate their willingness to do discernment counseling by initiating the call. \" Respect the autonomy of each person to engage in this process at their own pace. The phone intake is to describe, in sufficient detail, the purpose, goals, and process of discernment counseling. This overview helps ensure that you and the clients are on the same page with regard to expectation. It is important to point out how discernment counseling is different from marital therapy. The following is some language you can use: \"The goal of discernment is to help couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage based on a deeper understanding of the problems in the marriage and each person's contributions to them. \"\n\"Discernment counseling is typically a brief counseling modality and could last anywhere between one and five sessions. There is no need to commit to all five sessions because each of you would only commit to attending one session at a time. \"\n\"The format of the sessions consists of meeting as a couple with the counselor as well as having some time dedicated to one-on-one work with the counselor. After each one-on-one portion of the session, each partner will summarize what he or she is 'taking with them' from the time with the counselor and share it with the partner who was waiting outside the room. The first session is 2 hours, and subsequent sessions are an hour and a half each. \"\n\"In discernment counseling, we discuss the paths that are before every couple on the brink of divorce. Path 1 we call the status quo path and represents your relationship continuing the way it current is. Path 2 represents the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the possible reconciliation path, in which the couple agrees to take divorce off the table for a 6-month period of couples therapy, and each one commits to work on the relationship to see whether they can get the relationship to a healthier place. These three paths frame the discussions we have in discernment counseling.\"\n\"Discernment counseling is different from typical marriage counseling. The goal is not to solve your problems but to help you decide whether to try to solve your problems or choose a different path. It's not about immediate change in your relationship but seeing what changes each of you might need to make in the future if you decide to work on yourselves and your marriage.\"\nFinally, you can end this portion of the phone intake by asking how this process sounds to them and whether they are still interested on the basis of what you have discussed: \"Does this sound like a process that might hold some value for you in your current situation?\" We screen for safety and whether the couple has a history or any current experiences with intimate partner violence (IPV). What we are mostly concerned with is whether one of the partners is feeling coerced to participate and whether participating in discernment counseling will put one of the partners at risk of IPV. \"We want to make sure everyone who pariticpates in discernment counseling does so voluntarily and that no one is put at risk. So I have a few questions that we ask everyone who contacts us for an appointment. Are you feeling pressured by your spouse to participate in this project? Yes / No. If yes, does the pressure seem coercive (for example, is it accompanied by threats with personal or legal ramifications)? Yes / No Have you or your spouse ever had an order of protection from a court? Yes / No If yes, who? My last questions are about what happens when you and your partner get into arguments or fights. Again, our goal is to make sure everyone is safe. Has your partner ever done something to you out of anger that has caused you physical pain, bruises, or bodily injury? Yes / No (If yes, get specifics) Do you ever feel afraid of your spouse? Yes / No If yes, are you in danger now? Yes / No If yes to either, I can help you talk to someone at an agency that can help you. Would you like me to give you that information? In an emergency, urge the person to call 911. Ask if you can call back to check on the person. After having screened for safety and seeing no red flags, the individual on the phone is told that they seem to be an appropriate candidate for discernment counseling. Remember, it is not enough to just ask one partner these questions; both spouses have to be screened for this assessment to have validity. <br>We recommend that all couples therapy telephone intakes include an assessment or screening for <a data-href=\"Mixed-Agenda Couples\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a>. By adding the following questions to an agency phone intake protocol, you can reduce the chances of unintentionally assigning a <a data-href=\"Mixed-Agenda Couples\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a> to traditional couples therapy. “Leaning In or Out Measure.png” could not be found. Respecting autonomy and confidentiality is also a primary goal of the intake process. When intakes are correctly conducted, each spouse should feel heard and respected and believe that the discernment counseling process has something to offer each of them, regardless of their leaning-in or leaning-out status. We strongly recommend a 2-hour block of time because of the amount of ground to be covered in the session. After both partners' perspectives are heard in response to a series of questions, the discernment counselor meets one-on-one with both members of the couple, and each briefly shares what he or she learned in the individual conversations. The session ends with the couple in the room together for a summary of the work that was done that day and any impressions the discernment counselor has to share. If both spouses agree, the second discernment counseling session is then scheduled. <br>With <a data-href=\"Mixed-Agenda Couples\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a>, neither is much in touch specifically with their partner’s perspective, and often their estrangement can lead them to have little interest in understanding the other’s view. In this first meeting together, each person is asked to share their own and listen to the other’s views on how the relationship got to the point where divorce is a possibility, how they have tried to fix the problems they have identified, and how their children (if any) play a role in their decision making. They are also asked to provide a brief account of a time when things were going well in the relationship.\nThe important part in this session is that both people feel heard and respected. The discernment counselor begins this session with the first question: \"What do you hope to get out of our time together today?\"\nAfter each responds with his or her hopes for the session, you can either move on to the next question or simply acknowledge what you have heard. Sometimes people’s expectations are not directly in accord with the goals of discernment counseling. You can gently nudge them in the direction of more appropriate expectations for the 2-hour block of time: \"I know that you’re looking for answers and that right now things are really tough in this marriage, but I’m not sure this session will fully answer whether divorce or reconciliation is the right direction. And we won’t be trying to solve your marriage problems today. My hope is that the things we discuss today will help launch a conversation that contributes to you both being more clear and confident in how you’ll choose to proceed with your marriage.\" Continuing with both people in the room, there is a set of questions that all clients are asked in the first session. From the four key questions that launch discernment counseling, you should begin to get a sense of the couple’s overall relationship and some of the patterns that have governed their interactions. This is key to helping the couple see their current struggles in a new light. It is not just the recognition of the problems but seeing one’s role in the problems in the relationship and patterns of interaction.\nPay careful attention to the pain that is driving the leaning-out spouse to put divorce on the table and to whether the leaning-in spouse seems to understand that pain. Sometimes there is such a disconnect between the two narratives that you have a sense that neither partner is hearing a core message of the other. You can then offer the following brief exercise: \"I’d like each of you to take a moment to reflect on whether there is something important you want your spouse to hear that you are not sure he or she is hearing. Take a moment to reflect silently, and then I invite you to say it.\" Opening section of the session: Time management is crucial. Aim for no more than 40 minutes for the initial couple part of the first session, which means posing the questions, taking notes, nonverbally tracking, and just occasionally intervening to clarify and maintain the process of each speaking for him- or herself. \"What's happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?\"\nYou can ask either person to start, and you can ask either person to start, adn you can acknowledge that each partner will probably have a unique take on this question. At times you may have to be a bit of a traffic cop to control the flow of the conversation and to stop one person from interrupting to 'correct' the story of the other. We regularly find ourselves saying things such as, \"It sounds to me you don't quite agree on how they are presenting the story of how you got to this place in your marriage. That's understandable. In a moment I am going to ask you the same question because I know that you may see things somewhat differently. I'm mostly concerned with getting the views from both of you on how things got to be the way they are.\" Frequently one member of the couple responds for both people, as if they speak for the couple and there is high agreement on their version of the divorce narrative. When we hear this, we can stop the conversation and remind the person who is talking to speak only for themselves. \"I know you have a picture of how things got to be the way they are, but I'm concerned with the way you are referring to 'we' instead of 'I.' For example, you just said, \"We know we'll always love each other.\" That may be true for purposes of our conversation, I want to be really clear that each of you speaks only for yourselves - your thoughts and experiences. So, I'm wondering whether what you really meant to say was that you'll always love them. I just want to make sure I'm not reading into anything you say and that both of you understand that the other may have a unique perspective on the situation.\" We intervene when we hear these types of 'diagnostic' impressions. What we meant to avoid is one partner being an 'expert' on the other's psychological state. It takes away from one of the goals of the discernment process, which is for each person to see his or her own unique contributions to the decline of the marriage. It is important to hear each person so you can empathize with each one of them. A good discernment counselor has to convey that they understand both perspectives and are willing to help both partners. Another reason to know the divorce narrative well is to begin to hear and even map out the couple's relationship pattern. Most of them have never realized that their interactional pattern is predictable, routine, and can be changed and modified through good couples therapy. The process of asking for a divorce or initiating a divorce flies in the face of the decision and commitment to marry someone.\nIn discernment counseling, we get the divorce narratives of both partners so we can refer to them in future conversations. \"Can you tell me what you've done to try and fix the problems in your marriage, whether on your own or with help?\"\nThis might be because they are not sure what “counts” as a repair attempt. so, we often suggest things that might have happened: \"When you say you haven’t really done anything, I’m wondering whether there are things you actually have done, but you’re just not giving yourself credit for them. For example, you may have read a self-help book or connected with a therapist, even if it was just a temporary thing. Sometimes people seek out a wise family member to bounce ideas off but don’t consider this as “actively doing something” about their marital problems. When you consider all the ways you may have tried to fix things, what comes to mind?\" They are on the brink of divorce in part because they stopped turning toward each other at the developmental milestones of life. Fortunately, for many of these couples, just realizing that this has happened provides hope that if they expend effort in trying to get the marriage to a healthier place, they could see important changes.\nAfter hearing the couple’s responses to both the divorce and the repair narrative questions, you may be getting a sense of their unique interactional pattern. How do they deal with conflict or difficult situations? How do they respond to one another when life is stressful and one or both are experiencing anxiety? Later on, in individual conversations, you can begin to help them map out and describe how they respond to one another and see how they each “do” relationships, this one and probably any other intimate relationship in the future. You can begin to hypothesize possible ways to influence that pattern if the couple were to choose couples therapy in Path 3.\nThe divorce narrative and repair questions, you have not gotten a good sense of how the couple interacts when they differ or have conflict, we recommend asking the following explicit question before proceeding with the rest of the four basic questions: “Can you tell me a bit more about what happens between the two of you when you get into arguments or disagreements or when you experience conflict?” Once again, what you are trying to uncover is how the couple responds to relationship interactions when times are difficult or stressful.\nEach one of these patterns can be changed, but to do so, each member of the couple has to see his or her unique contribution to the pattern. \"What role, if any, do your children play in your decision-making about the future of your marriage?\" The purpose of this question is to open a space for the couple to talk about their concerns for the children, who are major stakeholders in any decision they make. Getting a sense of how the children figure into the decision-making process helps the discernment counselor understand what may be motivating each partner to work on the marriage or leave it. We do not comment on what they say in response to the children question but may refer to their answer in the individual conversations. \"Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy?\" It comes last to end the couple time on a positive note, if possible. But it is difficult to rewrite the relationship narrative to the point where they could escape any memories of a time when the couple found connection and joy with one another. The responses we get from this question typically center on good early years, with fun and sharing activities before the advent of children or significant work responsibilities. We encourage you not to settle for the minimalist response but rather probe for positive detail: Client: \"Well, the early days, when we were dating - those were the best times we had.\" Counselor: \"What was it about those early days that made it so good? What kinds of things were going on, or what felt good about being with her?\" We encourage you to get this description as thick as possible (while being brief) so you can draw on any strengths in future sessions or conversations. The response to this question can also be diagnostic. Before starting the individual conversations, it can be helpful to review the three paths that will be the focus of the individual conversations. You could say the following: \"As we turn next to individual conversations, I’d like to remind you that in discernment counseling we focus on three potential paths that are in front of you as a couple. Path 1 is staying together as you have been. It’s the status quo path. Path 2 is the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the reconciliation path and includes a commitment to 6 months of couples therapy to see whether you can put your marriage into a healthier place for both of you. It is not the path of staying married or avoiding divorce forever. It involves taking divorce off the table for 6 months, during which time you both commit to working on yourselves and the relationship. At the end of the 6 months, you can evaluate any progress you’ve made and make a determination whether your overall relationship health is on a positive trajectory. At that point, you may have a better sense as to whether you want to pursue divorce or continue in your marriage. These three paths will frame our individual conversations today.\" At this point in the session you are not looking for a response about the paths from either of them. In some cases, a leaning-in partner can be all too eager to let you know that he or she is “all in” on Path 3 at this stage of the session. If that occurs, gently remind him or her that you will talk more about the paths in the individual sessions. End the couple time by letting them know that the rest of the session will consist of individual conversations followed by a brief summary of what each has learned in the individual time, followed by a brief couple time at the end for reflections and wrap-up. We typically begin first with leaning-out partners. our rationale is that they are usually the ones who are less interested in the discernment process and less open to reconciliation and who may be feeling misunderstood and judged by the spouse and others who worry about a possible divorce. A partner who does not feel understood by the discernment counselor will have little incentive to engage in the process fully. Therefore, begin by inviting the leaning-out partner to tell you more about his or her pain in the marriage and the reasons for considering divorce. Be empathic, and listen for additional relationship patterns or significant events that have contributed to the decline of the marital relationship. Within no more than 10 minutes, switch to a conversation about the paths. Almost everyone, when asked about the three paths, rules out Path 1. The status quo is what brought them to the brink of divorce and to your office. Neither one is likely, at this stage, to suggest that things are just fine the way they are. For the leaning-out partner Path 2 has been on his or her mind quite a bit. You should find out more about exactly what steps he or she has taken to formalize the divorce.\nEach answer to questions asked to understand what attempts towards divorce the leaning-out partner has done Point to a different level of intentionality and may even address how serious the leaning-out partner is about the divorce, with more formal actions speaking the loudest.

Maladaptive process is 'he does it because he does not care about me' distress, mixture of contextual factors. DEEP analysis, useful to think about and assessment device, EFT is an integration of an experiential/gestalt approach with an interactional/family systems approach. It is a constructivist approach, in that it focuses on the ongoing construction of present experience (particularly experience that is emotionally charged), and a systemic approach, in that it also focuses on the construction of patterns of interaction with intimate others. <a data-href=\"Sue Johnson\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sue Johnson</a> and <a data-href=\"Leslie Greenberg\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leslie Greenberg</a> integrated these ideas. EFT adheres to the following basic premises of experiential therapies: The therapeutic alliance is healing in and of itself and should be as egalitarian as possible. In attachment terms, it offers a safe haven where emotion can be tolerated and reflected on, and a secure base where experience can be explored and expanded. The acceptance and validation of each partner's experience is a key element in therapy. This involves an active commitment to validating each person's experience of the relationship, without marginalizing or invalidating the experience of the other. The essence of the experiential perspective is a belief in the ability of human beings to make creative, healthy choices, if given the opportunity. It assumes that we find ways to survive and cope in dire circumstances, when choices are few, then later find those ways limiting and inadequate for creating fulfilling relationships and lifestyles. Experiential therapies encourage an examination of how inner and outer realities define each other; that is, the inner construction of experience evokes interactional responses that organize the world in a particular way. Experiential approaches take the position that we are all formed and transformed by our relationships with others. By helping partners change the shape of their relationships, the EFT therapist is also helping them reshape their sense of who they are.\nExperiential approaches attempt to foster new corrective experiences that emerge as part of personal encounters in the here and now of the therapy session. <br>EFT falls within the tradition of family systems therapies, drawing on systemic techniques - particularly those of <a data-href=\"Salvador Minuchin\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/salvador-minuchin.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Salvador Minuchin</a> 's structural approach, with its focus on the enactment of 'new' patterns of interaction. The unique contribution of EFT is the use of emotion in breaking destructive cycles of interaction. By helping partners identify, express, and restructure their emotional responses at key points in patterned interactions, the EFT therapist helps them to develop new responses to each other and a different 'frame' in the nature of the problems. EFT adheres to the following basic premises of family systems theory: Causality is circular, so it cannot be said that action A 'caused' action B. We must consider behavior in context. 'The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.' To be understood, the behavior of one partner must be considered in the context of the behavior of the other partner. And the behavior of each partner is to be considered in the context of their lives, including experiences of marginalization and sources of resilience. <br>The elements of a system have a predictable and consistent relationship with each other. This is represented by the systems concept of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Homeostasis\" data-href=\"Homeostasis\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Homeostasis</a>. The amygdala (the part of the brain that sets off the fight-or-flight response when one senses threat) is particularly affected by early experience; it also stores and processes emotional components of memories. Experience not only shapes neuronal circuits; it also affects the expression of genes, or epigenetics. It appears that some of these epigenetic changes are passed on intergenerationally. Intergenerational transmission of trauma is likely shaped by epigenetics as well as lived experience in the family. <br>There is a fine line between tracing old wounds to the family of origin and blaming parents for clients’ problems—a not uncommon phenomenon in therapy. Within the family field, “the <a data-href=\"Schizophrenogenic Mother\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/schizophrenogenic-mother.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schizophrenogenic Mother</a>” and “refrigerator parents” of children with autism\nThe contextual therapist extends concern to parents as well as the adult child client, holding a compassionate rather than a blaming stance toward the family of origin. Interventions are geared to help clients “grow up” their views of parents and siblings, toward a more complex and compassionate perspective. <br><a data-href=\"Murray Bowen\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Murray Bowen</a>, <a data-href=\"Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/ivan-boszormenyi-nagy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy</a>, and <a data-href=\"James Framo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">James Framo</a> were some of the founders of family therapy. <br>Bowen’s theory of <a data-href=\"Differentiation of Self\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Differentiation of Self</a> was a major contribution to the field. Framo (1981) was one of the earliest pioneers of family-of-origin work in couple therapy.\n<br><a data-href=\"Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/ivan-boszormenyi-nagy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy</a> developed contextual therapy which focuses on healing wounds from the past, repairing problematic intergenerational relationships in the present, and cultivating legacies for the future. Bowen (1978) posited that anxiety leads to fusion or cutoffs within the family of origin, affecting subsequent adult relationships. His approach emphasizes autonomy and differentiation, being able to hold one's own ground and not be excessively influenced by the needs and opinions of others. Bowen theory addresses the forces of autonomy versus togetherness, and the struggles to find a balance between them. His emphasis on autonomy and pathologizing of fusion has been criticized for being culturally myopic; many cultures value greater connectedness than Bowen endorsed. Bowen also identified tensions between reason and emotion, encouraging greater rational control. Feminists have critiqued this perspective, pointing to a male bias toward reason over emotion. From a neuroscience perspective, both reason and emotion are important; it is their integration that allows for healthy functioning. <br>Bowen developed the concept of <a data-href=\"Triangle\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Triangle</a>s. Where there is anxiety in the family, it passes from one member to another. Tension between two people is often managed by 'triangling in' a third party. <br><a data-href=\"Boundaries\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundaries</a> are important in Bowen theory: ideally clear and strong, but flexible, and culture-dependent in their form and function. <br>Intergenerational therapists, influenced by Bowen practice, routinely use <a data-href=\"Genogram\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Genogram</a>s in their work: drawing a family tree for each client, identifying losses and patterns of closeness–distance, mental illness, divorce, substance abuse, and so forth, going back multiple generations. <br><a data-href=\"James Framo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">James Framo</a> encouraged adult clients to get to know their parents as real people.

Framo supported clients becoming compassionate and forgiving rather than heightening anger at parents. <br><a data-href=\"Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/ivan-boszormenyi-nagy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy</a> developed ' <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Contextual Therapy\" data-href=\"Contextual Therapy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/contextual-therapy/contextual-therapy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Contextual Therapy</a>, an intergenerational approach that highlights family obligations, loyalties, and legacies. Nagy contends that adults owe their parents a debt of 'filial loyalty' - the loyalty of a child towards parents - for the care given them in childhood, even if that care wasn't optimal. He claims that if adults are stuck in resentment or cutoff with their parents, and don't repay the filial debt, they are likely to live out unhealthy patterns from their family of origin in their current relationships. They may seek to collect damages for the wounds of their childhood, but at the wrong address - looking to their partner or child to make up for what they did not receive early in life. Nagy claims, \"The victim becomes the victimizer\" through \"the revolving slate of vindictive behavior.\" Nagy's contextual therapy focuses on 'relationship ethics,' the balance of give-and-take in family and other relationships.\nNagy emphasized the obligations people have to the others with whom they interact. The therapist, while addressing problematic intergenerational family dynamics, also helps clients identify sources of resilience or 'resource of trustworthiness' in the family of origin. The neurobiology of emotional memories, behavioral patterns, and traumas from childhood impact couples in their current interactions\nIntergenerational transmission of stress and trauma, and research around emotional dysregulation, emotional regulation, and empathy. Experiences of discrimination such as racism, sexism, or homophobia, or of trauma from war, immigration, or poverty, shape partners' vulnerabilities and survival strategies. The couple therapist informed by intergenerational theory is sensitive to the cultural background and values of clients, assessing intergenerational-cultural wounds, as well as strengths that impact couple functioning. The dominant US culture privileges 'Power Over' (a win-lose competitive model of relationships) and individualism, valuing individual rights over responsibility to others. By contrast, many collectivist cultures emphasize responsibility and concern for other as well as self and obligations within the intergenerational family. Couple therapy is enhanced by incorporating a nuanced view of power, addressing Power Over imbalances between partners, while offering clients techniques for developing 'Power To' (living according to one's higher values) and 'Power With' (co-creating a relationship of respect, fairness, care, and compassion) Identity is not something one authors alone; it emerges in relational contexts. Within couples, partners enhance or diminish each other's identity. Intergenerational therapy addresses legacies inherited from prior generations (consciously or unconsciously) and legacies passed on to the future (intentionally or unintentionally). How one relates to the past affects how one acts in the present and what is bequeathed to the future: \"The dimension of relational ethics can be thought of as a bridge from one's past, stretching through oneself to the future.\" The language clinicians use affects interaction with clients. It is more productive to describe unhappy couples as “distressed” rather than “dysfunctional.”\nBehaviors that are causing distress within the couple—often based in survival strategies—while problematic now, may have been adaptive in the family of origin.\nProblematic survival strategies do need to be challenged in couple therapy - but from a place of respect and compassion for the contexts in which they evolved. Long-term love takes work, commitment, compassion, and generosity of spirit. But this is easier said than done. The pain and disillusionment when the rose-colored glasses come off are often exacerbated by seeing the partner through the filter of unfinished business from one's family of origin. For the couple to withstand the disappointment of infatuation's passing and work together to build a more lasting love, they need to reckon with wounds from the past that are reactivated with each other. Vulnerabilities from childhood are activated (e.g., a sense of inadequacy, feeling unprotexted, overwhelmed, or abandoned), triggering self-protective survival strategies (e.g., defending, withdrawing, criticizing, or attacking). The survival strategies of one trigger the vulnerabilities of the other, activating in turn the other's survival strategies, as the couple gets caught in an escalating cycle of reactivity. Distressed couples see their interaction in linear terms, each feeling like a victim and blaming the other. Happier couples, while they may get upset with each other, are able to look at their cycle from above; they see their interactions as circular, taking responsibility for their own contribution to the cycle. When partners are able to speak directly from vulnerability rather than attack from survival strategy, they are more likely to get a sympathetic response. Speaking from vulnerability elicits empathy; attacking from survival strategy begets defensivesness, counterattack, or withdrawal. Partners with flexible and adaptive survival strategies are more likely to be successful in relationships. If survival strategies haven't evolved since childhood, they may be rigid and inflexible. Happy couples repair well and often. Repair is a complex process, including awareness of the other’s hurt and perhaps feeling guilt over one’s role in the hurt. Many people are allergic to guilt.\nWhile neurotic guilt is damaging and pervasive, healthy guilt is one’s conscience, an acknowledgment of having hurt another, prompting repair. Repair also entails apology. If one was forced or humiliated into apologizing as a child, it may be hard to apologize to the partner now. Finally, repair entails forgiveness. Some people refuse to forgive, fearing that if they do, they will lose their leverage or be taken advantage of in the future. The experiences and role models each partner had in the family of origin for apology and forgiveness can help or hinder the partners now in their attempts at repair. Secure attachment with parents in childhood promotes trust and a sense that relationships are benevolent and safe. This sense of trust is brought to the adult intimate relationship, as the couple develops a secure bond. But if one or both partners did not experience secure attachment in childhood, it may be harder to trust each other. A blaming, resentful stance from childhood may be reenacted with the partner. Feeling like a victim of parents often leads to a more generalized victim stance, including in the couple relationship.\nEach partner’s vulnerabilities and survival strategies, which fuel the couple’s cycle or impasse, stem from experiences earlier in life, particularly in the family of origin.\nLinking these internal processes of hurt and self-protection to experiences in childhood can soften the couple interaction, facilitating partners’ increased capacity for self-responsibility and compassion. Humans function on autopilot most of the time, driven by emotions and habits wired into the brain since childhood. Happier couples are more thoughtful and able to choose their responses, and less driven by old habits or emotional reactivity.\nThe therapist helps distressed couples develop skills of emotion regulation, increasing proactive choice rather than knee-jerk reactivity. Unhappy couples get caught up in negativity, becoming emotionally dysregulated, driven to fight-or-flight by their amygdala. Instead of offering comfort, partners become sources of threat to each other.\nEven in the absence of physical violence, partners can become reactive. The nature of the threat is frequently related to experiences in childhood. Thus, a critical partner evokes emotional memories of a critical parent. And emotions are contagious. When the amygdala takes over, the higher brain, the prefrontal cortex, goes offline.\nThe therapist helps distressed couples develop tools for emotion regulation and explore issues from the family of origin that are activated in the couple escalation. In identifying their survival strategies and reflecting on the intergenerational contexts in which they evolved, clients increase thoughtfulness and decrease knee-jerk reactivity. A competitive, Power Over approach to conflict characterizes many unhappy couples. Clients who grew up feeling disrespected or disempowered may be more inclined to utilize Power Over behaviors with their partner. Happier couples are able to share power, rejoicing in each other’s successes, offering compassion in the face of hurt, making room for each other’s voice. Distressed couples often struggle over reality. Underneath the fight lurks the question of whose fault it was. Happier couples make room for both their realities. Each one cares about how the other sees the world and their relationship. If partners were raised in families where there wasn't room for their own experience, they may be more inclined to fight over reality with their partner. The therapist helps clients consider the stories they tell about their partner and family of origin. The lenses through which adults see their parents are often the same lenses through which adults see their partner. The capacity to rethink one's narratives and make room for multiple perspectives differentiates happy from distressed couples. <br>Nagy's concept of <a data-href=\"Multidirected Partiality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/multidirected-partiality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Multidirected Partiality</a>, the therapist sides with each individual, while also holding concern for the relationship itself. It is 'couple therapy': a space for two individuals to see if they can co-create a more satisfying relationship. The therapist helps each explore family-of-origin experiences relevant to their relational impasse. 'Corrective scripts' can be as constraining as 'replicative scripts', when one either repeats the same patterns as the family of origin or goes in the opposite direction. Both partners were shaped by their family-of-origin wounds. The therapist helps create a new script for their relationship that isn't haunted by the past. With a contextual perspective, the therapist is concerned about the impact of the couple's relationship on the children and about the impact on the couple relationship of children who are particularly challenging. Couple therapy is enhanced when each partner is or has been in individual therapy that increases reflectiveness and self-responsibility. The exception is if the individual therapist sees their client as victim and blames the partner, without encouraging the client to explore their own issues. In couples where partners have not been in individual therapy, the therapist may refer one or both to an individual therapist to do parallel work to the couple therapy; or the couple therapist may periodically see both partners individuals in addition to couple sessions. In individual sessions, clients are encouraged to consider their own survival strategies in the context of their families growing up. Reflecting on how and when one uses these survival strategies in the couple relationship facilitates differentiation, self-responsibility, and relational empowerment.\nAn agreement is created about confidentiality around individual disclosures in these sessions. Couple therapy is not viable if one partner asks the therapist to keep a secret (e.g., an affair).\nTrust in the therapeutic relationship is key, and secrets betray that trust. A balanced therapeutic alliance is crucial for the success of couple therapy; the therapist does not accept the role of judge. If there is egregious or abusive behavior, the therapist takes a stand; violence is out of bounds and the principle of safety first is bedrock in any therapy. Nevertheless, even setting limits and identifying problematic behavior is done from a place of concern and compassion. The therapist maintains a stance of “multidirected partiality” partial to each partner, on each one’s side. When clients feel understood and affirmed, the therapist can challenge them. Multidirected partiality is not neutrality; the therapist cares about both partners, is partial to each. But the partiality is balanced. The couple therapy office must be a “shame-free, blame-free zone,” a safe environment for clients to explore their vulnerabilities and relational disappointments. It is crucial that clinicians be aware of their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies, and note when they get caught up in a vulnerability cycle with clients. Therapists need to address unfinished business with their own family of origin. The therapist holds a stance of compassion, helping clients give voice to their vulnerabilities, yearnings, and pain. Each must feel understood and validated, that their vulnerabilities are held with care, their survival strategies respected.\nOnce the therapist hears the family-of-origin context in which vulnerabilities and survival strategies evolved, it is easier to convey that respect. It is only from this position of affirmation that problematic aspects of survival strategies can be challenged. The therapist must constantly balance validating and holding both partners, even while challenging them. Clients “resist” clinical interventions. This approach is collaborative, viewing “resistance” as important feedback. It is vital that the therapist not engage in a power struggle with clients. The intergenerationally oriented couple therapist is active, wearing different hats at different times: witness, coach, teacher, explorer of past influences on current impasses, facilitator of emotional expression and dialogue. Informed by contextual theory, the therapist holds in mind every person affected by this therapy, not just the individual or couple who comes in for treatment.\nTherapists who blame parents for a client’s problems create “iatrogenic” problems for the client. Parent-blaming by the therapist sets up a loyalty bind for the client between the “good” therapist and “bad” parents.\nWhile on rare occasions a parent may be currently dangerous (e.g., violent or abusing substances), most parents are not evil, violent, or psychotic; they are simply functioning with their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies. Pitting client against parents is damaging, likely to keep the client stuck in a victim position—lived out now in the couple relationship. Contextual therapists endorse a more expansive and compassionate view of parents in their own intergenerational context, extending multidirected partiality to the family of origin. The therapist is not challenging the client’s story of childhood pain, or denying or whitewashing the wounds of the past. Rather, the client is helped to understand parents’ limitations in terms of their life journey. Formal questionnaires or screening tools are not utilized, but individual and relational strengths and challenges are assessed, considering individual, interpersonal, intergenerational, neurobiological, and sociocultural levels of functioning. Why is this couple calling now? What has changed in their lives that is prompting them to seek treatment? Who makes the call? Do both partners want to come to therapy? What are their agendas (which may differ)? Does one want to leave the relationship, while the other wants to work on it? Did a crisis prompt the call for treatment? Partners may not be equally motivated to work on their relationship or stay together. Assessing motivations and goals is crucial. Assessing for safety is always a central concern. Is there a risk or history of violence, drug or alcohol abuse? Does one feel threatened, or unsafe, even without physical abuse? What are the couple’s power dynamics? Does one partner regularly defer and the other prevail? What options does each have outside the relationship?\nIf one partner is dependent on the other financially, with no resources of their own, power may be limited. Rather than assuming that partners are equal, the therapist assesses power differentials, including those related to race, class, or education. In mixed-gender couples, power issues related to gender have particular import. From the beginning, the therapist assesses couple interaction. As therapy progresses, the interactional patterns emerge more fully, and couple and therapist co-construct the vulnerability cycle diagram. The therapist assesses the flexibility or rigidity of each partner’s survival strategies, identifying the vulnerabilities underneath. Over time, the intergenerational backstory of each partner’s vulnerabilities and survival strategies emerges. Family history is discussed, including attachment histories, losses, or abuse. The therapist evaluates the emotional stability and functioning of each partner. Is there depression, anxiety, or other mental illness? If so, is it being treated? Does either have physical or health challenges? How able are they to tolerate frustration, criticism, or emotional intensity? What are their emotion regulation skills? What is their capacity for mentalization and dialogue?\nCan they make room for each other's perspective?\nHow generous is each partner with the other? Or are they more competitive? The therapist assesses the couple’s sociocultural resources and stressors. If they have children, are there emotional, cognitive, or health issues? What are the stressors or strains for the couple vis-à-vis their families of origin? Have they experienced trauma or oppression such as racism, marginalization, or homophobia? The assessment may extend further back, to trauma in preceding generations, as in Holocaust survivor families, descendants of slaves, or war or immigration experiences. What are the intergenerational legacies of pain or humiliation, trauma or loss, that may be impacting these partners now? In addition to considering stressors in the larger familial and cultural context, the therapist evaluates strengths and resources. What support is available to this couple from families or friends? Are there faith resources or other communal connections that sustain them? The therapist considers clients’ developmental journeys as individuals and as a couple. What prior relationships has each had? How did they get together? Did they fall in love? How has their relationship evolved? When did their problems start? The couple’s work and financial status are assessed as well. As the couple tells their story, the therapist begins drawing their genograms. This isn’t a formal project in the first session; the therapist meets them where they are, hearing the story of their current pain. At some point during the first few sessions, therapist and couple fill in the genograms, identifying family members and exploring the quality of the relationships and experiences of loss, abuse, or other violations in the multigenerational family. The therapist attunes to the interplay of relational ethics in the couple. What are the levels of trust and trustworthiness in each partner? Do they experience their relationship as fair? Are they able to hold each other in mind and tolerate multiple viewpoints? Does each have a voice, and can they hear the other? The ability to consider the impact of their behavior on the other’s wellbeing is explored. Of particular import is each partner’s capacity for taking responsibility and listening with respect and curiosity. The therapist assesses the extent of blame in their interactions, the ways they have disappointed and hurt each other, and their ability for empathy and repair. The identification of more specific goals is a collaborative process between therapist and couple. Initially, each partner may have different goals. Yet, fundamentally, most partners want similar things. As homework, I ask each to write 'The Ten Commandments of Our Relationship' From these lists, their joint values and goals are identified and operationalized, targeting behaviors that reflect these goals. Occasionally, partners have very different values that cannot be mutually accommodated. Therapy can be used productively to identify irreconcilable differences and, if the couple chooses, to separate with the least possible damage. For a clinician informed by intergenerational and particularly by contextual theory, a core goal is facilitating mutual responsibility and relational ethics. Distressed couples often feel disconnected, each partner disconfirming the other. One of the goals of therapy is to develop a shared narrative that incorporates a “we,” as well as each “I,” rekindling the connection and affirmation they had early on. Values from the culture of individualism and competition can be damaging to couples. The therapist helps partners consider their responsibility to each other, as well as their rights. They are encouraged to become more empowered, live up to their higher values, and “reach for their best self.”\nCarrying old wounds and resentments from the family of origin can impair the ability to be one’s best self with the partner; “growing up” one’s survival strategies is enhanced by “growing up” views of and relationships with family of origin. Therapist and clients jointly assess regularly how the couple is progressing toward their goals. When they have largely met their goals, or want to practice more on their own, they may stop, take a break, or have longer spacing between sessions, using monthly or bimonthly meetings as “checkups.”\nTreatment is not “terminated”; the therapist is available in the future should the need arise. Couples are encouraged to call if needed, without waiting for a crisis. Reengaging in couple therapy is not a sign of failure. The therapist is a long-term resource for the couple. Healing old wounds and developing new perspectives on intergenerational relationships can free the couple to coauthor their relationship in keeping with their values. After many repetitions of their cycle, distressed couples often experience the five “disses”: Partners are discouraged, disconnected, dysregulated, disempowered, and “dissing” each other. Each is helpless as the familiar cycle unfolds. The therapist facilitates the development of hope and agency through increasing connection, learning techniques for emotion regulation, building skills of relational empowerment, and enhancing respect—antidotes to the “five disses.”\nThe therapist offers a circular view of their interaction, working toward mutual empowerment and responsibility. The shift from blame and self-protection to empathy and self-responsibility engenders a proactive rather than reactive stance in each partner. Couples caught up in reactivity are driven by their emotional brains. Living on autopilot, they enact habitual, unproductive sequences based in survival strategies developed in the family of origin. The therapist helps each partner bring prefrontal thoughtfulness to amygdala reactivity. The ability to choose their response rather than react habitually is empowering for clients. Partners work to become authors of their own responses and coauthors of their relationship rather than victims of each other. They consider the impact of their behavior on the other’s sense of self, cultivating “preferred relationship practices”—lived aspects of relational ethics. This shift to thoughtful authorship in their responses to each other is enhanced as partners explore family-of-origin factors that have fueled their own reactivity. Emotion regulation is key to transforming the vulnerability cycle. There are individual differences in the capacity to self-regulate, due to both genetic variation in stress reactivity and childhood experiences.\nTechniques for emotional regulation: “Top-down” cognitive techniques, such as naming one’s emotion (which activates the prefrontal cortex and calms the amygdala). Reappraisal (reframing), a mental shift that allows one to see the partner in more open or sympathetic ways. Identifying goals, values, and intentions can also help clients moderate their reactions. More body-based, “bottom-up” techniques such as deep belly breathing, mindfulness meditation, or taking a break to calm down. Partners in a couple, seeing the same moment in different ways, may engage in “dueling realities.”\nMaking room for multiple narratives and differences of perspective and opinion, and recognizing the right of each to their own experience, are key aspects of relational ethics. Mentalization is the awareness that others have their own ways of thinking and experiencing. The therapist offers “construal humility” as a model, noting that we all construe or make sense of our world, but there are multiple ways to look at most interactions. Making room for dual narratives rather than dueling narratives is a key skill of relational ethics in both couple and intergenerational relationships. The nuances of each partner’s survival strategies and the vulnerabilities fueling them are not so readily apparent, but emerge over the course of several sessions, at which point couple and therapist together draw the diagram.\nCouples appreciate seeing their personal and interpersonal dynamics in the diagram, understanding how each one’s self-defense is triggering the other. The circular nature of the interaction becomes clear. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,295 deaths nationwide in 2010 as a result of IPV - 10% of all homicides. Rates among female and male same-sex couples are similar to those among mixed-sex couples. Aggression often begins at young ages, with 9% of high school students reporting physical violence by a boyfriend or girlfriend.\nClinic samples show similar rates of injury to men (15%) and women (12%). Men are more likely to use severe violence, and women experience greater psychological (e.g., depression, trauma symptoms) and physical (injury, death) consequences. Partner aggression is more common among couples who seek therapy, with on average half reporting physical aggression and 76–95% reporting psychological aggression by males and 69–95% psychological aggression by females.\nAs advocates for victims drew attention to battering of women in the 1970s, cases were addressed by providing shelters and using courts to mandate treatment for male perpetrators.\nIn the 1980s, some writers still suggested that women played a role in maintaining abusive relationships and were blameworthy for not leaving violent male partners.\nDue to gender-based power imbalances and patriarchal values, couple therapy was dangerous for victimized women. Four patterns of physical violence among mixed-sex couples: Patriarchal Terrorism or Battering (primarily by a male against a female to exercise control)\nViolent Resistance (by a female to counteract male violence)\nMutual Violent Control (bilateral violence for control)\nSituational or Common Couple Violence (bilateral, mild to moderate, expressing unhappiness) Partner aggression is not restricted to mixed-sex couples. Forms of psychological aggression (e.g., hostile withdrawal, denigration of the partner, domination and threats of violence, and restriction of the partner’s freedom) commonly precede and co-occur with physical aggression. Rates of psychological aggression among community couples are approximately 75%.

Diagnostic Principles","icon":"","description":"\nDSM-TR is a manual for assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders and does not include information or guidelines for treatment of any disorder. Determining an accurate diagnosis is the first step toward being able to appropriately treat any medical condition, and mental disorders are no exception. DSM-5-TR is helpful in measuring the effectiveness of treatment, as dimensional assessments will assist clinicians in assessing changes in severity levels as a response to treatment. 1840: Category 'insanity' first attempt to quantify and name psychiatric diagnoses. 1844: APA published a predecessor of the DSM: A classification of institutionalized mental patients Early 1900s: First description of schizophrenia by Emil Kraeplin. 1917: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, included 22 diagnoses. 1952: First DSM, 130 pages long, 106 disorders 1994: DSM IV, 886 pages long, 297 disorders 2000: DSM IV-TR, 943 pages long, 365 disorders 2013: DSM 5, 991 pages long, 157 disorders 2022: DSM-5-TR, 1050 pages long A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from dysfunction in the individual, as described above. The DSM is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria which facilitate diagnosis.\nIt is the standard reference for clinical practice in mental health. Please also be familiar with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-10 Codes) The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continues to evolve.\nToo rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... the degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder).\nClinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress. Reliable diagnoses are essential for: Guiding treatment\nIdentifying prevalence rates\nIdentifying clients for clinical research\nDocumenting public health information Standardizes billing and coding\nStandardizes diagnoses and treatment\nGuides research\nGuides treatment Oversimplifies human behavior\nIncreases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis\nProvides labels, which can be stigmatizing Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders.\nTakes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation. Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process.\nIntegrates measures administered at initial interview and over time to track symptom status and response to treatment. A categorical approach to assessment relies on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity. Ask Categorical (Yes/No)\nAsk Frequency (How often?)\nAsk Intensity/Severity (Rating: mild, moderate, severe)\nAsk Duration (How long does it last?) Disorder-specific and correspond closely to the diagnostic criteria. Some are self-completed by the individual, couple, or family. Interpreted by clinician\nShared back with the individual, couple, or family Others require a clinician to complete Categories: Cognition (understanding and communicating)\nMobility (moving and getting around)\nSelf-Care (hygiene, dressing, eating, and staying alone)\nGetting Along (interacting with other people)\nLife Activities (domestic responsibilities, leisure, work and school)\nParticipation (joining in community activities) A generic assessment instrument for health and disability\nUsed across all diseases, including mental, neurological, and addictive disorders\nShort, simple and easy to administer (5 to 20 minutes)\nApplicable in both clinical and general population settings\nA tool to produce standardized disability levels and profiles\nApplicable across cultures, in all adult populations\nDirectly linked at the level of the concepts to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) An assessment of the member's needs based on: Baseline measurements\nSymptoms\nBehavior\nSkills\nAbilities\nResources\nVulnerabilities\nSafety Assessment methods and use of standardized assessment tools. Clinical summary, including recommendations and prioritization of needed mental health or other services.\nInvolvement of the member and member's family in the assessment and his or her preferences or referrals to services.\nSufficient data to support findings on all axes of the current Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM), and any differential diagnosis.

Globally, it is estimated that 5-10% of adults suffer from depression. Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. More women are affected by depression than men. Depression can lead to suicide. There is effective treatment for mild, moderate, and severe depression.

History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs. Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain, or heart disease. Certain medications, such as high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills. Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence\nNeglect\nAbuse or poverty May make some people more vulnerable to depression Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical, or pessimistic. People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression. Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression. Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems.

Some part of their life was profoundly impacted. Think about the time part. Severe because it can lead to serious consequences. How long did it last. Bipolar I and II is not a difference. Is it lasting for a long period of time or a short period of time? It is a common misperception that children cannot have bipolar disorder. Although most people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood, the symptoms can appear earlier in childhood. In children, happiness, silliness, and “goofiness” are normal in many social contexts; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet the Criterion A mood requirement of abnormally elevated mood. For the happiness or silliness of a child to meet Criterion A, it must be distinctly increased from the child’s baseline and accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that to those who know the child well are clearly unusual for that child. For a child’s symptoms to meet criteria for a manic episode, the symptoms must also meet Criterion B for mania and must also represent a change from the child’s usual baseline.\nIn children, overestimation of abilities and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the child’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.\nThe increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal association with other symptoms of mania.\nThe peak age at onset of bipolar I disorder across studies is between 20 and 30 years, but onset occurs throughout the life cycle. Special considerations are necessary to apply the diagnosis in children. Because children of the same chronological age may be at different developmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “expected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her own baseline in determining whether a particular behavior is “normal” or evidence of a manic episode. Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier than for major depressive disorder. Age at onset does not reliably distinguish between bipolar I and II disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode. Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter. The vast majority of youth with cyclothymic disorder experience the onset of mood symptoms before age 10. Bipolar I Disorder\nBipolar II Disorder\nCyclothymic Disorder Bipolar I disorder is a manic-depressive disorder that can exist both with and without psychotic episodes. Bipolar II disorder consists of depressive and manic episodes which alternate and are typically less severe and do not inhibit function. Cyclothymic disorder is a cyclic disorder that causes brief episodes of hypomania and depression. Bipolar I (Mania)\nBipolar II (Hypomania) Lasts at least one week, or any length if hospitalized due to mania Abnormal and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy. During Criterion A symptoms, three or more of these symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity\nDecrease in need for sleep\nMore talkative than baseline or fast talking\nFlight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing\nDistractibility (reported or seen)\nIncrease in goal-oriented activity (especially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose\nExcessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (e.g., unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretion or foolish business investments) Mood disturbance severity Causes marked impairment in social or occupational functioning OR\nRequires hospitalization to prevent harm OR\nThere are psychotic traits Differential diagnosis Substance use and medical causes are ruled out Distinct period that lasts at least four consecutive days and is present most of the day, nearly every day. Abnormally and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy. In context of Criterion A above, three or more of these symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) have persisted and are markedly different from baseline and have been present to a significant degree. Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity\nDecrease in need for sleep\nMore talkative than baseline or fast talking\nFlight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing\nDistractibility (reported or seen)\nIncrease in goal-directed activity (socially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose\nExcessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions or foolish business investments) Unambigious change in functionining not characteristic of the person when not symptomatic\nMood disturbance and change in function are observable by others\nEpisode does not cause significant impairment and is not severe enough to require hospitalization If there are psychotic features, it is a manic (not hypomanic) episode. Not attributable to different diagnosis Substance use and medical causes are ruled out Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day\nDiminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day\nSignificant weight loss or gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day\nInsomnia or hypersomnia\nA slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)\nFatigue or loss of energy nearly every day\nFeelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day\nRecurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode. During the above 2 year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time.

Reckless or self-destructive behavior. Hypervigilance\nExaggerated startle response\nProblems with concentration\nSleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep) With dissociative symptoms: The individual's symptoms meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in response to the stressor, the individual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following: Depersonalization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of one's mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly).

Restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in functioning (social, academic, occupational) There is not just one cause of ASD\nThere are many different factors that have been identified that may make a child more likely to have ASD, including environmental, biologic, and genetic factors. Although we know little about specific causes, the available evidence suggests that the following may put children at greater risk for developing ASD: Having a sibling with ASD\nHaving certain genetic or chromosomal conditions, such as fragile X syndrome or tuberous scierosis\nExperiencing complications at birth\nBeing born older parents Developmental monitoring (collecting or gathering information) and screening (testing). Surveillance or developmental monitoring is an active ongoing process of watching a child grow and encouraging conversations between parents and providers about a child's skills and abilities. CDC's Learn the Signs Act Early program has developed free materials, including CDC's Milestone Tracker app, to help parents and prociders work together to monitor children's development and know when there might be a concern and if more screening is needed. Screening is when a parent or provider completes a checklist or questionnaire specifically designed to identify problems that need further evaluation. General developmental screening should occur at the 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well child visits and whenever a concern is expressed. Autism-specific screening should additionally occur at the 18- and 24- or 30-month visits and whenever a concern is expressed. 1% of the population\nUnclear whether higher rates reflect expansion of diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, or true increase. Intervention and support may mask difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the severity of the condition, developmental level, and chronological age; hence the term spectrum. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple sources of information: clinical observations, caregiver history, self-report (when possible) 'Red Flags' for autism. Do not use this language when discussing symptomatology. DSM-5 perpetuated that \"only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work independently in adulthood; those who tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills.\"\nDSM-5-TR: While it was once the case that only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder lived and worked independently in adulthood, as diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made more frequently in those who have superior language and intellectual abilities, more individuals are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills and thus are productively employed. Access to vocational rehabilitation services significantly improves competitive employment outcomes for transition-age youth with autism spectrum disorder. In general, individuals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently. 1 in 11 children\nBoys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as girls\nSymptoms can change over time Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms may decrease, but inattentive symptoms often remain Inattention and impulsivity can put children's health at risk from injury and disease.

Disturbances in sexual response or sexual pleasure. Clinically significant. Destigmatize clinical assessment of sexual dysfunctions. Understand the risk factors. Assess for sexual functioning in the clinical interview. Remember that in many couples, underlying sexual dysfunctions exacerbate the presenting problem - whether that be issues in intimacy, communication, conflict resolution, infidelity, mood disorders, etc. Conduct the evaluation in comfortable surroundings and ensure privacy\nBe empathic, nonjudgmental, and understanding\nPreferably use the language in which patient is comfortable\nUse neutral terms (as opposed to vulgar terms) and proper medical terms as long as there are in common usage (e.g., use 'penis' and 'vagina,' but perhaps 'lips' rather than 'labia')\nUse anatomical drawings to understand patients knowledge and explain sexual issues to the patient\nReassure the patient that sexual dysfunction or adjustment problems are common and treatable. (\"It is common for some people to...\")\nExplain things in simple, clear and specific terms. Some patients may not be able to understand the language which is commonly used by clinicians and may feel embarrassed to admit this. Hence, whenever new terms are used, provide alternatives or explanations. Check with the patients that they understand the terms used\nStart with general, non-threatening questions first (e.g., \"Do you have a regular partner?\") then ask more specific and potentially embarrassing questions (e.g., \"Do you also experience this problem when you masturbate, that is, when you touch or stimulate yourself?\")\nAssumptions must be avoided (e.g., sexual orientation, numbers of partners, sexual practices)\nIf a couple has presented together, gather the information for a sexual history from each individual separately (i.e., not in each other's presence)\nConduct the evaluation in presence of a female attendant/relative while examining patients of opposite gender\nMake sure that the 'problem' does not just reflect a lack of knowledge or unrealistic expectations on the part of the presenting individual or their partner.

The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... The degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder)\nClinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis.\nThe diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress.\nReliable diagnoses are essential for: Guiding treatment\nIdentifying prevalence rates\nIdentifying clients for clinical research\nDocumenting public health information Physicians\nPsychologists\nSocial Workers\nNurses\nCounselors\nEpidemiologists\nNeuroscientists\nNeuropsychologists\nCouple and Family Therapist It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Manic Episode A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).\nDuring the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\nMore talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness non-global-directed activity).\nExcessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by related changes that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. (pg. 178)\nWhat differs among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology. The presentation of children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol.\nFor children up to 12 years of age. Children with this symptom pattern typically develop unipolar depressive disorders or <a data-href=\"anxiety disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">anxiety disorders</a>, rather than bipolar disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood. (pg. 178) Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).\nThe mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. <br>The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href=\"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href=\"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href=\"Separation Anxiety Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>) <br>This diagnosis cannot coexist with <a data-href=\"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a>, or <a data-href=\"Bipolar Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bipolar Disorder</a>, though it can coexist with others, including <a data-href=\"Major Depressive Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Major Depressive Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href=\"Conduct Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/conduct-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Conduct Disorder</a>, and <a data-href=\"Substance Use Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/substance-use-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Substance Use Disorder</a> s. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. A diagnosis based on a single episode is possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of cases. <br>Careful consideration should be given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. <a data-href=\"Bereavement\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bereavement</a> may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode of major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the depressive symptoms and functional impairment tend to be more severe and the prognosis is worse compared with bereavement that is not accompanied by major depressive disorder. Bereavement-related major depressive episodes tend to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders.

Book\nTitle: DSM-5 and family systems, Editor: Russo, Jessica A.; Coker, J. Kelly; King, Jason H.; Publisher: Springer Publishing Company, LLC,\nLocation: New York, NY,\nYear: 2017 ISBN: 978-0-8261-8399-6 Keywords: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; Family Therapy; In Progress; Mental Disorders; diagnosis; methods Neurodevelopmental disorders can be defined as a series of complex traits that emerge as a result of genetic determinants interacting with various poorly understood environmental components resulting in a diverse clinical presentation. The onset and diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders occurs in childhood. These disorders rarely experience a remission or relapse and are considered to be a stable set of symptoms over time, and thus neurodevelopmental disorders appear throughout the individual's life span. Bipolar disorder affects and is affected by the family system and successful treatment is enhanced when family embers understand the course and treatment of the illness, respond in supportive ways, and stay patient and empathetic within the context of constructive communication and problem-solving. Bipolar Disorder takes a significant toll on personal efficacy and self-worth and is often bewildering to family members as they try to manage the symptoms of the illness and support their affected loved ones in the midst of frustrating and competing interpersonal, social, and logistical factors. The emergence of Bipolar Disorder as manifested by intense periods of mania, often followed by periods of deep depression, disrupts peace, tests relationships, clouds future dreams and aspirations, and often destroys marriage and family relationships. The presence of mania (As manifest in Bipolar I Disorder) or hypomania (As manifested in Bipolar II Disorder), which is a state of intense, energized mood, cognition, and behavior, resulting in an increased capacity for creativity and clarity of thought (Rational and irrational), rapid ideas and racing thoughts, sometimes irritability and impatience with others, reduced need for sleep, distractibility, and objective-focused activity, and/or energy present most of the time during the episode. With mania and hypomania, there is a decreased need for sleep, increased sexual desire, and a need for stimulation, which can involve risk-taking behaviors resulting in painful and/or harmful consequences. The subjective experience of mania is also characterized as paradoxical where there is a lightning-fast epiphany beyond the vision of all others, which produces a feeling of grandiosity and power. Many who experience mania describe feeling frustrated at their limited capacity to experience and carry forward these creative insights, like drinking water from a fire hose. Mania, but not hypomania, is also sometimes accompanied by delusional thinking and psychosis, which mimic symptoms of <a data-href=\"Schizophrenia\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schizophrenia</a>. Hypomania contains similar symptoms manifest in mania, but of a lesser duration and lesser intensity, and is a characteristic of Bipolar II Disorder. The most frightening time for those experiencing mania is when it begins to dissipate because for many it signals the descent into depression. Another complex manifestation of depression is Bipolar With Mixed Episodes. These depressive episodes are characterized by deep sadness, hopelessness, feelings of emptiness, fatigue, lack of energy, loss of appetite, listlessness, dysphoria, and apathy for a minimum of 2 weeks. Depressive episodes are often attended by shame and embarrassment for the consequence of manic actions, a lack of pleasure in activities once enjoyable, the need to isolate from others, a sense of worthlessness, guilt, stomach aches and pains, troubled sleep, and thoughts of death. Whereas in mania, the risk of death is typically from thrill seeking, in depressed individuals, the primary risk of death is suicide. Many who suffer from bipolar depression describe the subjective feeling of depression as intense as is the feeling of mania. Mania is characterized as the 'highest of highs' whereas depression is characterized by the 'lowest of lows.'\nSuicide is a very real concern for the bipolar client, family, and friends, and those treating bipolar persons. In the course of antidepressant of bipolar disorder, or depression, the first symptoms that respond to treatment are a lack of energy (i.e., people become more energized) and sleep (i.e., people tend to sleep between when on antidepressants), and one of the last symptoms to clear up is mood. This makes people with Bipolar Disorder especially susceptible to suicide because they actually have the energy to kill themselves. States of high energy along with depression increase suicidal risk. <br>The <a data-href=\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-of-mental-disorders-(dsm).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</a> categorizes Bipolar and Related Disorders as: Bipolar I Disorder: Characterized by a manic episode lasting 7 days or longer Bipolar II Disorder: Characterized by a hypomanic episode lasting no more than 4 days. Cyclothymic Disorder: Characterized by hypomanic symptoms that would not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a hypomanic 'episode' and depressive symptoms that would not meet the full symptom criteria for a depressive 'episode.' This includes a lower level of intensity of both extremes, a lower level of frequency with symptoms occurring for 4 days compared to 7 days for a manic episode, and a subthreshold of symptoms necessary to meet the disorder. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder: Characterized by symptoms of mania precipitated by a particular medication or substance (e.g., illicit or prescribed) and Bipolar Disorder Related to a Medical Condition, in which symptoms of mania can be precipitated by a health-related condition. Mania becomes the primary symptom distinguishing Bipolar Disorder from other depressive disorders and causes significant 'impairment in social and occupational functioning,' as well as a disruption to family relationships and functioning, which is the general standard that distinguishes problematic behavior from a mental disorder. Prevalence rates for all Bipolar Disorders for adults are 3.9% over the lifetime with 2.6% of the adult population meeting diagnostic criteria in a given year and 2.5% of adolescents meeting them over the lifetime with 2.2% of the population meeting criteria in a given year. Approximately 1.7% of adolescents report having mania along during the lifetime, and 1.3% report having manic symptoms in a given year. 50% to 67% of adults reported the onset of Bipolar Disorder before the age of 18 and 15% to 28% reported experiencing symptoms before 13 years. There is some evidence suggesting that women experience Bipolar II Disorder at a higher rate. Women also tend to experience higher 'rapid cycling' (i.e., four or more mood episodes within a single year) and more 'mixed states' (i.e., mixed symptoms or 'features' of mania and depression within a single episode) than men. Bipolar Disorder with Mixed Features is especially difficult to treat with psychotropic medication because of the nature of simultaneous manic and depressive symptoms. There is a hereditary component in Bipolar Disorder, 'A family history of Bipolar Disorder is one of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for Bipolar Disorders.'\nOver 90% of those experiencing a manic episode eventually have recurring episodes and roughly 60% of individuals having a manic episode also have a depressive episode, so the likelihood is high that mania persists within individuals with multiple episodes, including episodes of depression. The persistence of symptoms within the interepisode phases of the illness indicates that, for many, there is never a break within this chronic condition. Depressive episodes in the bipolar cycle are much more difficult to treat and that individuals spend much more time in depressive states than manic ones; research suggests as much as three times as many weeks during the year with depressive symptoms versus symptoms of mania. Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, often debilitating condition that requires a multifaceted treatment approach to manage effectivity.\n<br>For both adults and adolescents, symptoms of Bipolar Disorder can be comorbid with a wide variety of other disorders including <a data-href=\"anxiety disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">anxiety disorders</a> (including specific phobias), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, serious and often untreated medical conditions, and, for adolescents, disruptive and/or conduct disorder, and 'disorders with prominent irritability.' The primary treatment of Bipolar Disorder is psychopharmacologic, and typically starts with lithium bicarbonate and other mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics and anxiolytics that are often prescribed in the acute phase of the illness. Because individuals with Bipolar Disorder often have sleep disturbance, sleep medications are often prescribed to regulate circadian rhythms. Good sleep hygiene is one of the easiest and best ways to help prevent triggering mania. The use of electroconvulsive therapy is an option for entrenched, severe, and persistent depressive symptoms. A common and frustrating feature of medication treatment for bipolar individuals is medication compliance. Individuals affected with Bipolar Disorder often find the effects of drug therapy as blunting the euphoric effects of the experience of mania, and develop abhorrence to the side effects of the medication. They are also often resistant to the idea that they will be taking medications for the rest of their lives in order to maintain a balances mood, to help them make reasoned choices, maintain their interpersonal relationships, and support systems, and lower the incidence of additional and severe episodes. Re-hospitalizations for bipolar patients was lowest in the multifamily group, and the researchers pointed to the potential that patients may have learned to see themselves as less of a burden on family members, to experience more support from others (especially their own families), to feel less isolated, and to feel enhanced hope in learning how to cope more successfully with their condition. Family and social relationships are central to the affected person's ability to live successfully with this condition. Individuals experiencing manic and depressive symptoms reflect the bewilderment, anger, hopelessness, and existential despair often felt in family members who struggle to support their impacted loved one while at the same time trying to make sense of what is difficult to accept: that their loved one has a chronic condition that will persist throughout their life and, as family members, they too travel a parallel path. The tangible consequences include being introduced into the legal system with adolescent or adult family members who may act out during a manic episode and violate the law. Other potential, practical consequences include unemployment resulting from inconsistent or poor job performance; impulsive and poor financial decisions resulting in loss of income, savings, or retirement resources; loss of social status within the community; interfacing with mental health agencies and social services and a wide variety of mental health personnel; and often being marginalized by a mental health system that does not recognize the legitimate burden family members carry and the inability to access important treatment information on behalf of their affected loved one because of right to privacy and confidentiality. Sometimes partners of spouses, sons and daughters of parents, and parents of children may cut off and/or leave or divorce the impacted relative because of the stress attendant to this condition. These life disruptions cast a pall on other family and social activities and center the collective energy and family resources on addressing the problem. It is difficult to maintain hope in the future under these conditions. The intangible or emotional fallout for the family is a real and felt experience and centers on working to accept the disorder and attendant consequences. When an affected individual is in a manic state, family members may initially find the observed behavior as interesting or exciting, but soon turn to distress and anxiety as their loved one becomes more impulsive, unpredictable, and erratic; the family member may leave and not return home for days. If the manic episode is new to family members, there is often confusion about how to respond and about the immediate need for perspective. Often, family members seek to discern differences between the illness and the characteristics of the affected loved one in an attempt to make sense of their behaviors. If the affected individual is a parent, children and other family members need reassurance; if a child, parents may seek to discipline or reason with their loved one with little success. Some become violent, destructive, and/or manifest delusional and psychotic symptoms that are frightening, and family members are faced with having to protect and be protected from the affected family member. If the manic episode is repeated as part of the course of the illness, family members become retraumatized to the episode and may seek equilibrium through a variety of behaviors, ranging from acting out themselves (mostly in children) to calm responding to the situation and following a predetermined plan. Often family members try to reason with the affected member with little success. During episodes of depression, family members seek to motivate and instill hope within their family member and often face their own sense of hopelessness and despair when attempts to support, encourage, and offer solutions are rejected or treated with indifference. \"One's attention is focused on the wellbeing of the person with Bipolar Disorder in such a way that one's own needs take second place. Being closely related to someone with Bipolar Disorder also means simultaneously foreseeing and following the often sudden and unexpected changes of the person with Bipolar Disorder.\" The DSM system is based on a medical model and is inherently limited in validating treatment approaches other than medical. <br>The <a data-href=\"Cultural Formulation Interview\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/cultural-formulation-interview.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cultural Formulation Interview</a> provides a framework to assist clinicians in assessing the cultural identity of the affected individual, perceptions of the distress (including how the cultural group of the client would view the problem), psychosocial stressors and 'cultural features of vulnerability and resilience,' and cultural aspects of both the client and the clinician that might impact treatment. Viewing culture therapeutically includes a perceptual expansion of cultural groups to include age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, occupation, military service, social networks, substance use, migration status, geographical region, relationship status (i.e., married or divorced), and not simply race and ethnicity. Though Bipolar Disorder presents with similar incidence in men and women across races and cultures, there is some observable difference in the course and progression of the disorder. This is due primarily to differences in initial diagnosis, access to treatment, and perceptions of stigma associated with mental health. <br>Comparing individuals with Bipolar Disorder from African ancestry with those with European ancestry, a trend was observed in the misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, most often as <a data-href=\"Schizophrenia\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schizophrenia</a>. It is possible that behaviors observed in minority patients during a manic phase are more commonly misconstrued as psychotic rather than manic. Another possibility for the misdiagnosis of schizophrenia in minority patients with Bipolar Disorder may be related to fears associated with seeking mental health services and an inherent mistrust of a system that has historically oppressed and marginalized them. Presenting as extremely guarded, paranoid, or having a blunt affect - all common symptoms of schizophrenia - may be rational expressions resulting from their previous experience of racism. Minority groups are disproportionately affected by challenges to healthcare access and experience greater stigmatization for seeking mental health services. Some minority groups may be disproportionately affected by environmental factors and social inequities, which may directly and indirectly contribute to both the development and progression of Bipolar Disorder. It is advocated that clinicians use empathy and authenticity when working with Bipolar Disorder clients, and to not be afraid of conflict within the process of making therapeutic contact. \"The meeting and initial work with manic persons is often complicated. When we meet with them, we collide with them. We have to confirm the collision, not deny it.\" Demonstrating empathy for paranoid and grandiose thinking is not only critical for a successful therapeutic alliance, but gives the clinician a more accurate assessment as to the extent of the client's delusions, grandiosity, and paranoia. Counselors modeling for clients a sense of humor and often a playful attitude in their interactions together help clients learn to more realistically view themselves and reality-test relationships. Humor, appropriately and skillfully used, also helps reinforce for clients that their counselors do not view them as a culmination of their manic and depressive episodes, but as people who can be related to, which is empowering to them. Bipolar-affected clients often know that they negatively impact loved ones and others, and, as a result, feel deep shame and guilt for what is often irritating and offensive behavior, having a place that is safe for them to explore different ways of seeing themselves is important. The job of the clinician: First, to seek to existentially be with manic patients and then, to counterprojectively give perspective to those patients about their manic worldview, without completely denying it. This can lead to a healthy therapeutic alliance, which itself has a mood-stabilizing effect. Along with mood-stabilizing medications, this alliance can lead patients towards full recovery. The therapeutic relationship provides a place where the bipolar client can experience acceptance and the family can receive real and targeted support. It is important therapists show patience and adaptibility in working with patients with Bipolar Disorder and their families. Self-esteem, belief in one's own efficacy, and engendering hope for the present and future functioning is vital for those suffering from Bipolar Disorder. This awareness on the part of the therapist guides treatment and ameliorates the dysfunctional beliefs, the black-and-white thinking, and blunts the corrosive effects of mania and depression. Counselors should directly involve the family in the treatment of the identified family member with Bipolar Disorder. Family members can often provide much more accurate and rich perspectives regarding what happens when the family member with Bipolar Disorder is manic and/or severely depressed. Counselors can help clients with Bipolar Disorder to develop 'advanced directives' that may include signed consent from clients about how the illness is to be addressed or treated, including being treated against their will if they are in a full-blown manic or depressed episode. We want clients with Bipolar Disorder to be thinking about the course of their illness and making decisions about treatment when they are balanced, lucid, and making rational judgements rather than when they are manic or depressed. This can best be accomplished within the context of supportive family members who can express understanding and empathy, while at the same time express clearly the consequences of clients' manic and depressive behaviors and advocate strongly for responsive and responsible actions to be take. Genetic, biological, and environmental factors do not appear independent of each other but all 'interact in bringing about episodes of mood disorder or in protecting against their occurrence.' Understanding how these factors mutually impact and are impacted by each other over the course of the disorder can help manage episode occurrence and develop resilience in affected individuals and their families. Genetic and biological vulnerability includes the manifestation of the disorder in members of an affected person's family (i.e., who in the family has or has had the bipolar or related disorders), brain functioning (i.e., to what level may there be structural or brain abnormalities and quality of functioning and dysfunction in neurotransmitters), and other biological factors (e.g., chemical imbalances, changes in hormonal and immune system functioninig, sleep regulation). When vulnerability is high in these areas, the amount of environmental stress needed to trigger a manic or deppressive episode tends to be low. Those with high vulnerability have a low tolerance for and little protection form events that others without the disorder might manage quite well. Those with low vulnerability to genetic, neurologic, and biological factors would likely not be vulnerable to mood episodes unless there were high social stressors at play. Low environmental stress acts as a protective factor from the occurrence and reoccurrence of mood episodes. Because the nature of genetic or biological vulnerability may be hard to detect and determine, managing environmental stress becomes a high priority in treating and managing bipolar episodes and their severity. Psychosocial Provoking Agents: Largely impact vulnerability and the manifestation of manic and depressive states. Because Bipolar Disorder impacts individuals and families in often unpredictable and disorientating ways, and because of the consequences within the family, family members often assume patterns of responsing that range form being long-suffering, helpful, and supportive to being critical, blaming, and something uncooperative. These reactions contribute significantly to the emotional climate within the home and impact the perpetuation of continued episodes. 'Cause and Effect relationships between mood disorder symptoms and family environmental factors are bidirectional: Families are affected by Bipolar Disorder as much as they affect it.' The Vulnerability-Stress Model was developed from research on family interactions with patients with schizophrenia. Emotional Expression (EE) is a measure of emotional attitudes among relatives of a psychiatric patient. It is defined as critical, hostile, or emotional overinvolvement statements and attitudes family members communicate overtly or indirectly to the member (s) affected by the disorder. High EE Level within Family (Z 63.8) captures this dynamic. Individuals with Bipolar Disorder are two or three times more likely to deteriorate into a manic or deppressive episode in families where high EE exists and experience prolonged and more severe manic or depressive states.\nHigh EE causes stress that contributes significantly to the perpetuation of mood episodes. EE develops and is perpetuated between the affected child and their parents. The child reinforces high EE reactions within parents, which impacts all relationship functioning. Children who exhibit behaviors and attitudes consistent with a low tolerance for stress, unstable mood, elevated anxiety, irritability, and problematic cognitive functionining largely meet the criteria for high biological and generic bulnerability. Generational influences within high EE families can significantly impact the vulnerabilities of family members who may be predisposed to Bipolar Disorder and bulnerable to criticism toward their condition. The Vulnerability-Stress Model helps clinicians assess and further understand not only the relationships between genetic, biological, and socioenvironmental factors, but helps focus attention on the EE and the quality of interpersonal reactions in the home that could be either provoking manic or depressive mood states or protecting affected individuals from their recurrence. Assessments for Bipolar Disorder are characterized as the individual assessment and diagnosis of the disorder while family assessment addresses essential aspects of the family environment including the quality of family interactions. A thorough biopsychosocial assessment should be conducted on the client upon the initial intake (or shortly thereafter) to capture a comprehensive context in which the presenting problems occur. All biopsychosocial assessments should include: Mental health history\nMedical family history\nPersonal history that includes a developmental timeline\nConducting a mental status exam (i.e., appearance, behaviors/psychomotor activity, attitudes affect and mood, intelligence, and reliability, judgement, and insight)\nLegal problems\nSubstance use\nSpirituality/religion\nCultural/ethnic background\nSuicidal ideation (including ideation, plan, attempts)\nFinancial concerns and socioeconomic status\nResources and Resiliency factors\nUtilizing the Level I and Level II Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures associated with the DSM-5 can also provide a targeted assessment of symptoms, including the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale. Another helpful measure that can detect both threshold and subthreshold levels of mania is the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Bipolar Disorder Screening Scale. The goal of individual assessment is to obtain a differential diagnosis; it is important to: (a) administer formal assessments ethically and according to the protocols specified in specific instruments including being trained in the administration and interpretation of data\n(b) gather and make sense of the data and share the results with clients in a manner that is comprehensible, clearly explaining the eliminations of assessment and assessment results. (c) use the data to confirm existing clinical impressions and/or to generate new clinical directions. Consultation with other professionals, including those of a treatment team is essential. The family can provide important context for the counselor in diagnosis and treatment, which leads to the process of family assessment. As part of the protocol of a comprehensive family assessment with all willing family members present, the counselor have the family (or a family member and the affected bipolar member) engage in conversation regarding their relationships or how they have attempted to solve problems they experience for 5 to 10 minutes and to observe and note the number of EE statements that are generated within the interaction and what the statements are. This gives important data about the level of EE, but sensitizes counselors to what family members value, what they may be struggling with, and the process and context of their conversations. <br>Developing sensitivity to the quality and types of interactions family members have can give counselors useful information in designing treatment, including the <a data-href=\"Genogram\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Genogram</a>, which can be used to develop an understanding of where Bipolar Disorder (and other mental health problems) has occurred within the family. A genogram is a multigenerational family tree that symbolically represents different dynamics related to family and individual functioning that is psychologic, cultural, and interpersonal in nature. The Mood Disorder Burden Index was developed to assess caregiver perceptions and experiences in three core domains: patient mood symptoms, caregiver's worries about the future, and caregivers' interpersonal difficulties with the patient. The Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale: A self-administered instrument designed as an alternative to psychiatric measures that fail to assess for treatment outcome and recovery and well-being for those afflicted with Bipolar Disorder. It can give counselors insight into how the individual with Bipolar Disorder has been impacted by the disorder and, indirectly, how the family has been impacted. Counselors should always be mindful of being client centered, empathically inquisitive, and validating of the subjective experience of clients and their families as information is gathered during the assessment process. Assessment is a continuous process of measuring symptom reduction, improvement in family communication and problem-solving, acceptance, and self-efficacy living with Bipolar Disorder. Pharmacological intervention with an integration of individual psychotherapy is more effective than either protocol alone. Goals for treatment have focused on symptom reduction and prevention of future episodes. Psychosocial stressors can directly contribute to, or even catalyze, the occurrence of a bipolar episode. The occurrence of an episode can aggravate psychosocial stressors. Broader systemic influences including systemic racism, poverty, a global health crisis can all put a strain on an individual's ability to regulate emotion, something that is particularly difficult for individuals with Bipolar Disorder. A cycle can develop of constant challenge and crisis, which may self-perpetuate without the disruption of systemic treatment. Treatment of Bipolar Disorder should take an integrative approach to best serve the client's needs which invariably includes family systems work. Bipolar Disorder actually comprises a group of heterogeneous disorders, with significant variations in etiology, manifestation, and severity. The questions becomes not whether family systems treatment is or is not effective for Bipolar Disorder, but how and when it can be applied and adapted according to the needs of the client and family. FFT is an integrative approach to treatment of Bipolar Disorder, which combines psychoeducation and family therapy. It has been shown to enhance family cohesion and reduce family conflict. FFT begins with a thorough assessment of individual symptomology and family systems dynamics, and proceeds through a structured and preset treatment, with specific goals throughout the duration. Important elements of assessment: Gather as much information during intake as possible. Identify family conflicts that may be contributing to the stress across the system, which in turn can exacerbate Bipolar Disorder symptomology in the identified client. Determine the presence and severity of other environmental stressors - such as low socioeconomic status, experiences of oppression and marginalization, or experiences of extreme stress or trauma - which can impact family members individually as well as the relationships across the system. Understand the strengths and protective factors across the system that can support the emotional regulation of the individual with Bipolar Disorder, as well as the overall health of the family system. This information informs both the psychoeducation and therapy components of treatment, as it guides both specific goals and interventions. Understand the clients' cultural beliefs, practices, and influences on the family system. This is important to not only to provide a context to the experiences and dynamics of the system, but also to provide the counselor with a perspective on how FFT may need to be adapted somewhat to maximize efficacy. Determine appropriateness of the type of intervention. The extremes of bipolar episodes cause significant conflict in family systems, and may make some or all members unwilling to participate. Not all individuals are appropriate for the FFT protocol. Persons who are in acute phases of Bipolar Disorder, have developmental disabilities or other biological conditions that impact cognition, refuse to adhere to medication protocols or have a comorbid active substance use disorder are among those for whom FFT is not recommended. FFT is an effective treatment for Bipolar Disorder and its use can significantly impact relapse of the disorder. Higher rates of anxiety, depression, and general distress were found in caregivers of those diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Family-based interventions improve illness outcome and caregiver well-being. FFT has been found to have a positive impact on the mental health of caregivers, even when the diagnosed family member is not participating in the treatment. The course of treatment of FFT for Bipolar Disorder is fairly structured and is based on three treatment stages: (a) psychoeducation, (b) communication enhancement training (CET), and (c) problem solving. Treatment using FFT usually lasts approximately 9 months, and is structured around 21 sessions that generally generally begin following an acute phase of Bipolar Disorder. Clinical sessions are conducted weekly for the first 3 months, followed by a step-down to bi-weekly, then once per month. The philosophy of FFT is that Bipolar Disorder is experienced by the family, not just by the diagnosed client. As Bipolar Disorder episodes are viewed as 'disaster' experiences shared by the family system, which in turn cause disequilibrium. The treatment is reestablishing balance and harmony to the system, which in turn supports the health and wellness of the diagnosed client. Counseling goals are identified early in treatment and are informed from intake and assessment sessions. FFT for Bipolar Disorder begins with 6 general goals that outline and guide the overall process: Integrate the experiences associated with episodes of Bipolar Disorder. The focus of this goal is to understanding the diagnostic features of Bipolar Disorder as well as the experience of it from the perspective of the diagnosed individual. It also helps family members accept both the severity and significance of the diagnosis. Accept the notion of a vulnerability to future episodes. The focus of this goal is in the recognition that Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, persistent, lifelong diagnosis that requires continual support. The diagnosed individual - as well as the family - may believe that the condition can be 'cured' and thus have an unrealistic expectation of treatment. The periods of stability that occur between episodes can often contribute to this incorrect assumption. Accept a dependency on mood-stabilizing medication for symptom control. Consistent use of mood-stabilizing medication can minimize the intensity of Bipolar Disorder episodes and prevent future occurences. The undesirable side effects of many medications can make the client less willing to maintain this portion of the treatment protocol. Distinguish between the client's personality and the Bipolar Disorder. Over time, the diagnosed individual may be viewed by family members solely through the lens of the disorder. This can lead to inaccurate assumptions about the meaning and importance of behaviors. Recognize and learn to cope with stressful life events that trigger recurrences of Bipolar Disorder. FFT is based on the Vulnerability-Stress Model. This model includes both an understanding of preexisting biological conditions that create vulnerability and the environmental stimuli that trigger or catalyze reactions based on this vulnerability. While biological components cannot be altered, clients and families should understand how psychosocial stressors such as conflictual relationships, major life changes, and severe emotional stressors can impact the vulnerability of an individual with Bipolar Disorder. Reestablish functional relationships after the episode. The key features of this goal are support and connection. The before, during, and after phases of Bipolar Disorder episodes can be aggravated by the conflicts that arise across family systems in response to the situation. A goal for treatment is enhancing communication patterns within the family system and providing families with coping skills. In the initial stage of treatment using the FFT model, the primary goal is psychoeducation. This stage is broken down into phases with focus on different informational needs. In the beginning, the clinician imparts a great deal of vital information to the family system. It is important for this to be done in a warm, interactive manner. Clinicians using FFT must be aware of the potential for this stage to devolve into a solely instructional experience and take intentional, conscious steps to avoid this. Continually checking in with family members and encouraging discussion about the material can minimize this risk and enhance rapport with family members. In the beginning of the psychoeducation stage, the clinician should provide an overview of the FFT protocol, reasons for family participation, and the role of the clinician in the treatment process. Treatment goals should also be addressed, both the general FFT-based goals and the specific goals for the family system. This is also a good time to provide an overview of Bipolar symptomology, as well as prodromal symptoms and environmental triggers. The clinician should take the time to explore the unique experiences and perspectives of each family member. Often it is the associated meaning for the system members that impacts the manner in which they cope with and react to a Bipolar Disorder episode. Discussions around environmental triggers are an important way for families to better understand the blind spots they may have regarding the diagnosed family member's vulnerabilities. Events that may be considered minor, benign, or otherwise simply normal life events to some family members may prove to be substantially more stressful for the family member with Bipolar Disorder. A lack of empathy for the different experiences of the family member with Bipolar Disorder may also create conflict, as the affected family member may feel unsupported and misunderstood. <br>The DSM-5-TR <a data-href=\"anxiety disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of excessive or paralyzing fear and/or intense anxiety with associated disturbances in behavior. More adults were reporting anxiety-related symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic while more youths reported anxiety-related symptoms by the end of 2020. Various factors such as fear for the health and welfare of themselves and their families, inconsistent daily routines including school closures, and mounting tension in their homes have led to increased reports of anxiety in children. Despite experiencing anxiety-related symptoms to be diagnosed the individual must exhibit symptoms of significant distress or impairment across multiple domains in functioning (e.g., familial, social, academic, or occupational). <br><a data-href=\"Anxiety disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of intense fear or anxiety, avoidance of feared stimulus, and can cause life interferences, emotional distress, and impaired functioning. <br>The distinguishing features differentiating the DSM-5-TR <a data-href=\"anxiety disorders\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">anxiety disorders</a> are the focus of each anxiety disorder or the core feared stimuli, and the focus of the fear informing the other individual domains of focus in the DSM. These domains include: Cognitive Response The cognitive response for the anxiety disorders is worry. Individuals with anxiety tend to exhibit two cognitive errors: Overestimating the probability of a negative event (i.e., thinking a negative event or outcome is much more likely to happen than objective reality)\nCatastrophizing (i.e., thinking the worst-case scenario will happen) Physical Response The physical component is the physical response to fear such as muscle tension, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, and other symptoms associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Behavioral Response The behavioral response to anxiety is the active avoidance of the feared stimuli. In SAD (social phobia), the core feature is the fear of negative evaluation by others. It follows that across the other individual domains the core feature of fear, anxiety, or both would be consistent. An individual meeting criterion for SAD would fear being evaluated by others (core focus of their anxiety; cognitive component). The individual may sweat, tremble, or experience heart palpitations (physical component) as well as avoid giving speeches or talking in class (behavioral component). Anxiety disorders represent one of the highest prevalent disorders within children and adults. It is estimated that 15%-20% of children and adolescents are affected by an anxiety disorder. An estimated 40 million adults in the US have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. <br><a data-href=\"Lifetime Prevalence\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/lifetime-prevalence.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lifetime Prevalence</a> is the percentage of individuals who meet criteria for a disorder during their lifetime. <br><a data-href=\"Point Prevalence\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/point-prevalence.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Point Prevalence</a> is the percentage of individuals who meet criteria for a disorder during a specific period of time. Anxiety disorders severely impair physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, academic functioning, and the overall quality of life of an individual. Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are sick more days from work and have lower work productivity. Individuals with anxiety disorders are common patrons of primary care settings, specialty clinics, and emergency room services. Individuals with anxiety disorders have higher rates of relationship distress and divorce. <br>A <a data-href=\"Risk Factor\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Risk Factor</a> is defined as any attribute, characteristic, or experience that increases the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder. A risk factor and the root cause of an anxiety disorder may differ greatly; therefore, having a risk factor is not the same as causing an anxiety disorder. Genetics or hereditability increases risk for all of the anxiety disorders. Individuals with first-degree relatives (e.g., parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder are at an increased risk to develop an anxiety disorder. 30% to 40% of variance in the anxiety disorders is due to genetics. Other risk factors contribute more than half of the variance to the development of anxiety disorders. <br>A strong link between the <a data-href=\"Temperament\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/temperament.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Temperament</a> style that is of <a data-href=\"Behavioral Inhibition (BI)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-inhibition-(bi).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Behavioral Inhibition (BI)</a> and anxiety disorders.

Most temperaments are inherited, and family members are also likely to have similar temperaments. Parents are likely to model and reinforce their child's tendency toward BI or emotionality. Stressful life events and trauma relate to an increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder, such as early parental loss, childhood abuse, previous trauma, and peer victimization. Anxiety disorders are often maintained by several individual factors. An individual factor is identified as something that is internal or based on the individual as opposed to a family or societal factor that maintains anxiety disorders. The individual factors and systemic factors influence one another in a reciprocal manner. An individual's behavioral response and cognitions develop within the context of their family. <br>Several behavioral factors have been linked to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. <a data-href=\"Behavioral Avoidance\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-avoidance.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Behavioral Avoidance</a> maintains all of the anxiety disorders. In the short term, behavioral avoidance is a coping strategy that temporarily relieves anxiety; however, long-term behavioral avoidance is a key factor in maintaining all anxiety disorders. Many times the larger system, either the family or school, reinforces behavioral avoidance of feared stimuli. Cognitive factors that maintain anxiety are the thoughts and thinking styles contributing to maintaining an anxiety disorder. <br><a data-href=\"Attentional Bias\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/attentional-bias.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attentional Bias</a> for threat maintains anxiety disorders. Individuals with an anxiety disorder tend to pay more attention to stimuli that appear threatening to them, and they have difficulty noticing anything else other than the perceived threatening stimuli. Individuals with anxiety disorders perceive neutral stimuli as dangerous compared to individuals without an anxiety disorder. <br>A second cognitive factor related to the maintenance of anxiety disorders is <a data-href=\"Cognitive Avoidance\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-avoidance.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive Avoidance</a>. Attentional bias and cognitive avoidance are internal processes; however, the family system or larger systems influence the internal process of attentional bias and cognitive avoidance. Many parents model attention bias for children. Parent may model cognitive avoidance, teaching their children to respond in the same manner. In adult romantic relationships, a partner may influence the process of cognitive avoidance as well. The majority of research on the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders focuses on the individual variables or individual therapy. Relational factors related to the etiology or maintenance of anxiety disorders: <br><a data-href=\"Relationship Quality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/relationship-quality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Relationship Quality</a> Lower relationship quality within the couple or family system relates to anxiety disorders.\nCouple conflict, lower relationship satisfaction, and couple violence all correlate with adult anxiety disorders. Couple distress has been linked to an increased risk in developing an adult anxiety disorder. Conflict between parents consistently relates to childhood anxiety disorders. Individuals within a relationship who experience high attachment anxiety will often question their partner and behave in hypersensitive ways in an effort to avoid rejection which increases relationship distress. <br><a data-href=\"Communication\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/communication.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Communication</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Accommodation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Accommodation</a> Sexual dysfunction (SD) is typically viewed as biologically based, yet a person's lived sense of sexual wellness is most often situated within relational, interpersonal, and cultural contexts.\nSexual health is shaped by the interaction of a person's unique biological, psychologic, and cultural experiences and has significant impacts on mental, emotional, and relational well-being. Earlier editions of the DSM were also critiqued for omitting gendered differences in sexual functioning. Clinical judgement based on biopsychosocial context is recommended in diagnosis, particularly when the client possesses identities that are marginalized socially and within clinical research. <br>Sexual Dysfunctions (SD) in the DSM-5-TR include <a data-href=\"Delayed Ejaculation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Delayed Ejaculation</a>, <a data-href=\"Erectile Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Erectile Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Female Orgasmic Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/female-orgasmic-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Female Orgasmic Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD)</a>, <a data-href=\"Induc ed Sexual Dysfunction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Induc ed Sexual Dysfunction</a>, <a data-href=\"Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/male-hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder</a>, <a data-href=\"Premature Ejaculation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Premature Ejaculation</a>, <a data-href=\"Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction</a>, <a data-href=\"Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction</a>, <a data-href=\"Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction</a>. Clinical judgement is urged in ruling out the following causal factors: Inadequate sexual stimulation\nCultural factors that may impact the experience of pleasure\nProblems better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, substance use, a medical condition, or by several relational distress, partner violence or other stressors. The DSM-5-TR uses the subtypes of lifelong, acquired, generalized, and situational to designate the onset of the sexual problem. A variety of factors that should be considered during diagnostic assessment include: Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems; partner's health status)\nRelationship factors (e.g., poor communication; discrepancies in desire for sexual activity)\nIndividual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement)\nCultural or religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity or pleasure, and attitudes toward sexuality)\nMedical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code for the relationship problem or stressor may be listed. The usefulness of reframing the term dysfunction as a 'sexual concern,' 'issue,' or 'challenge' in the effort to depathologize sexual difficulties and adopt a more normalizing perspective when discussing sexual issues with clients. Modalities of family/relationship systems therapy (e.g., internal family systems, Imago therapy, and emotionally focused therapy) to support the treatment of sexual issues for individuals and relationships. Sexual issues are most often first encountered and then subsequently treated and resolved within the context of intimate partnerships. <br><a data-href=\"Sexuality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/sexuality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sexuality</a> encompasses sex, m gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, and reproduction and is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles, and relationships.\nIn the United States, societal sexual norms are often extensions of cisgender, heterosexual, White, patriarchal, Judeo-Christian, and able-bodied assumptions of sexuality. For this reason, many individuals - especially those with historically marginalized identities - develop an internalized sexual worldview that lies in contrast with their own sexual realities. This incongruence can lead to misinformation about one's sexuality, internalized shame, insecurity, and a myriad of other barriers that may negatively impact sexual functioning, sexual pleasure, and sexual communication and negotiation with partners. Culturally or religiously imposed values can shape a person's emotional experience related to sexuality in meaningful ways that can hinder and/or support one's sexual well-being.\n<br><a data-href=\"Intersectionality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/intersectionality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intersectionality</a> - which posits that individuals hold multiple, intersecting social and cultural identities, each carrying certain privileges and oppressions given the individual's broader sociocultural and political landscape. Counselors seek to understand the ways in which a client's complex experience of power and oppression shapes their sexual functioning, as well as to explore the client's unique protective and risk factors given their multifaceted identities. Even in instances when sexual concerns are not the primary reason for seeking counseling, sexual assessment provides the clinician with an important opportunity to assess for possible comorbidity with presenting issues, better understand the client's cultural and relational values, and normalize the presence of sexual discussion amidst the counseling process. General sexual wellness assessment can be included in initial intake paperwork, as well as in follow-up sessions once therapeutic rapport has been established. Examples include: How would you currently describe your overall sexual wellness?\nWhat concerns, if any, do you currently have about your sex life or current level of sexual satisfaction?\nOn a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), how would you currently rate your sexual wellness? How did you arrive at that number? What changes would you like to see in that number? Are there any issues related to your sexual health and wellness that you would like to discuss in counseling? For couples, general sexual wellness assessment can include other items on couple intimacy and sexual wellness. Examples include: How would you currently rate your sexual intimacy today? How does that compare to other times in your relationship?\nIf you could have any changes to your current sexual relationship, what would you hope to see?\nHow do you define physical intimacy in your relationship? How important is physical intimacy to your overall relationship health?\nHow might your sexual relationships be related to your primary reasons for seeking couples counseling at this time? Counselors can help clients with initial discomfort by emphasizing: Sexuality is a normal and natural element of human existence\nSexual health often has important implications for clients' mental health and may assist the counselor in providing holistic and informed mental healthcare\nClients are free to answer only those questions that they feel comfortable answering, and they are also welcome to respond at a later time. Following an intersystemic framework, counselors can approach sexual assessment systematically and contextually. An intersectional systemic approach, 'balances attention to the individual, couple, and family system, as well as the larger systems in which we live.'\nThis framework outlines the five domains impacting client sexual wellness: Individual-biological/medical\nIndividual-psychologic\nDyadic relationship or couple dynamics\nIntergenerational influences\nContextual factors such as society, culture, history, religion, and physical/geographic environment. The first level of assessment, individual-biological/medical, is aimed at understanding what if any, underlying biological and/or medical issues might be causing the sexual issue, including causes related to natural aging and developmental hormonal changes. People who have recently given birth may experience hormonal shifts that limit sexual desire, which may also be connected to culturally deprived beliefs about sexuality and motherhood related to reduced sexual drive. Examples include: Do you currently have any physical issues and/or medical conditions? How has this impacted your sexual wellness and functioning?\nAre you currently taking any medications? What affect, if any, does this medication ahve on your sexual wellness and functioning?\nHas disability impacted your sexual wellness? If so, how?\nHow has your sexual wellness and functioning changed as you have aged? Even if no medical/biological issue is reported, referral to a medical doctor or sexual health specialist (if the client has not done so already) is advised if sexual issues are present that appear to be biologically/physiologically based. The second level of assessment is individual-psychologic, which assesses potential psychological factors for sexual dysfunction, including comorbidity with existing and prior mental health issues. Psychotropic medications used to treat mental health issues can also interrupt sexual functioning. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., SSRIs) have been shown to further induce sexual side effects, such as lowered libido, and arousal/orgasm difficulties. Assessment questions of the psychologic dynamics of sexual dysfunction include: Have you previously experienced mental health issues? If so, what was the impact of those issues on your sexual wellness?\nHow does your mood typically impact your libido and sexual functioning?\nWhen you feel (client's mental health symptoms), how does that tend to impact your sexual well-being? How, if at all, does your sexual desire and ability to experience pleasure shift when your symptoms are at their worst? Over the course of treatment, it is recommended to regularly monitor any changes in the client's sexual function as an additional point of insight into the client's overall mental health, as well as to establish a timeline of the sexual problem. The counselor will assess the relational dynamics of the sexual issue, which includes relational attachment, conflict history, communication, intimacy, and the presence of intimate partner violence (IPV). The goals of relational assessment are for the client(s) and counselor to explore how the dynamics of the relationship may be contributing to the sexual issue, as well as how each individual partner is coping with the presence of sexual difficulties. Common areas to explore include the client's sexual history with their current partner, communication strategies used by the client(s) when discussing sexual issues with their partners, and patterns of initiating, negotiating, and engaging in sexual activities. A sexual history assessment may also be a helpful tool in discovering the couple's shared and individual levels of sexual knowledge, communication patterns, and sexual desires/interests.\nExample items for sexual history assessment include: How did you first become sexually intimate with your partner? How would you describe your initial sexual connection? How has this changed over time?\nWhat types of sexual activities do you and your partner engage in?\nWhat types of partners and solo activities give you the most pleasure?\nHow would you like to see your sexual relationships change or grow?\nHow is sex initiated in your relationship? How do each of you respond when you're interested in sex, but your partner isn't?\nHow do you communicate your sexual needs and desires to your partner?\nWhat challenges do you face, if any, in talking to your partner about sex? The sexual worldview of individuals in a relationship may also have significant impacts on the quality of sex in the relationship, as well as the quality of the total relationship. Sexual problems can cause physical and emotional distress, shame, and embarrassment during sexual encounters, which can inhibit the level of satisfaction and pleasure derived by all partners. How do you feel when you're experiencing the sexual issue?\nHow does your partner respond to you when you're experiencing the sexual issue?\nWhat are your major fears or insecurities about this issue?\nHow, if at all, are these fears related messages you received about gender/race/sexuality growing up? An imbalance of power (e.g., physical, emotional, financial, and/or childcare responsibilities) in the relationship can create challenges to the development of trust and intimacy, which can affect the sexual relationship and can further affect the individual's sexual functioning. Before addressing the sexual wellbeing of the relationship, existing violence and/or severe conflict would first need to be addressed. Example items to assess the presence of relational distress and violence include: How do you typically address, navigate, and resolve conflict in your relationship?\nHow does your relationship typically handle jealousy, anger, and resentment?\nWhen, if ever, have you experienced physical or emotional violence in your relationship?\nHow does conflict tend to impact your sexual relationship with your partner? <br>The <a data-href=\"Genogram\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Genogram</a>, which allows for the clinician to interview the client, sketch out family patterns of relating through generations, and assess the client's present difficulties from an intergenerational point of view. By creating a genogram with the client or couple, the counselor can locate patterns of <a data-href=\"Enmeshment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enmeshment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enmeshment</a>, <a data-href=\"Emotional Cutoff\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-cutoff.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Emotional Cutoff</a>, and <a data-href=\"Triangulation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangulation.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Triangulation</a> that may be connected to the sexual issues experienced by the client or couple. The genogram allows the couple to understand the sexual issue from a more contextual and systemic perspective, which can initiate new, more functional patterns of relating. In this way, the genogram is both an assessment tool and an intervention strategy (McGoldrick, 2008) Questions on the sexual genogram focus on six core areas: Messages received about sexuality/intimacy and gender\nCommunication and behaviors related to sexuality\nSexual secrets\nLacking information\nEach partner's response to the other's genogram\nGoals for growth in the client's/couple's genogram. Sample items to include on the sexual genogram include: How did you first learn about sexuality?\nHow do members of your family, community, and cultural background(s) tend to view sexuality?\nHow did your caregivers and family members respond to your sexual development (e.g., secondary sex characteristics, masturbation, first dating experiences, and access to safer sex/family planning resources)?\nAre there sexual events that are silenced or not talked about in your family-of-origin?\nHave you previously experienced difficulties with your arousal or orgasm?\nHow have these difficulties impacted you and your partner(s)?\nHow do you feel about the look, smell, and taste of your genitals? How does this impact your sexual connection with your partner(s)?\nWhat is the meaning/purpose of sex for you? The goals of this final level of assessment are for the client to gain awareness of impact of cultural values on their sexual wellness, as well as to affirm the unique resiliencies the client has developed in response to these overarching systems. Example items to include in the contextual assessment: How, if at all, did religion impact your understanding of sexuality growing up? How about your cultural backgrounds?\nWhich of your identities are most salient to you? What assumptions/expectations exist for each of your identities with respect to sex (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc.)?\nHow do members of your cultural background tend to view sex and gender? Masturbation? Sexual pleasure?\nIn what ways, if at all, have you felt like your sexual well-being was limited because of your identities?\nWhat sexuality supports do you wish you had received as a young person?\nWhat changes have you made to your personal understanding of sexuality throughout your life? What is most empowering about your current sexual worldview? Often when clients simply articulate the unspoken limitations of sex-negative value systems on their lives, they are empowered to update these perspectives in ways that are more congruent with their current ethical framework. A primary aim of family systems counseling is for the client to glean new insights into the relational dynamics in their life and to subsequently feel empowered to shift the boundaries, attachments, and communication patterns of those relationships that are not actively serving the client's mental and sexual wellness. The PLISSIT model describes four levels of care ranging from introductory to specialized - Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, and Intensive Therapy - which can be applied to client. The first level of care, permission, describes the counselor's role in giving the client express permission to discuss sexual issues in counseling, while emphasizing that sexuality is a normal, natural, and worthwhile topic of examination throughout a person's life. Permission-giving is intended to affirm clients' sexual well-being, destigmatize sexual discussion, and invite continued and ongoing sexual exploration throughout treatment. Often limited information is needed in order to provide the client with additional knowledge related to their specific sexual issue (i.e., psychoeducation).\nSpecific Suggestions may be required to improve the issue, such as giving a client a homework assignment to view their genitals in the mirror, practice sensate focus with their partner, or engage in a series of nonsexual touch exercises with their partner in the counseling office. (Counselors are recommended to join sexuality-specific organizations for additional learning opportunities such as the Association for Counseling Sexology and Sexual Wellness (ACSSW) and the American Association for Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT))\nThe final level of care, intensive therapy, ins indicated in situations when the client is not finding relief from previous levels of treatment, which often signals comorbidity with underlying trauma, mental illness, and/or addiction issues. The need for intensive therapy may also prompt referral to a certified sex therapist, sexologist, or some other sexual healthcare. PLISSIT is not used in lieu of an evidence-based treatment approach, but rather as a supplemental directive informing the progression of treatment. Sexual assessment should be invitational, responsive to the client's cultural background and comfort level, and expressly relevant to the client's presenting issues. Questions based on the counselor's personal, nontherapeutic curiosity should be avoided.\n<br><a data-href=\"University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference</a> can occur when a client brings up a topic that has personal resonance with the counselor and in situations where the client or client's situation reminds the counselor of someone/something in their own life. Countertransference is a normative experience for counselors; however, the counselor's initial awareness of countertransference must be followed up with consultation, supervision, personal therapy, and/or continued education in order to prevent personal reactions from further impacting the therapeutic process.\nArousal can be a naturally occurring response to sexual discussion; however, it is important for the client and counselor to adhere to clear boundaries if arousal/attraction occurs. \"Sexual discussion can often stir up a wide range of confusing and exciting emotions. Maintaining a professional counselor-client relationship is critical in keeping this space safe and sacred for you. \"\n\"I am getting the sense that this conversation is exciting you right now. While that can be a common response to sharing intimate sexual details, I want to remind you of our professional boundaries. If you need a break from this conversation, you are welcome to step outside, grab some water, or reschedule for a later time.\" The importance of normalizing the existence of client attraction and focusing on creating opportunities aimed at supporting counselors as they establish and uphold boundaries, process 'forbidden' feelings, and practice enhanced bracketing skills with a peer or supervisor. Counselors must clearly communicate goals, priorities, and rationale for the decision to apply a sexual dysfunction diagnosis, as well as facilitate an informed discussion of the risks associated with sharing a diagnosis with an outside source, such as a health insurance company or in the case of a judicial subpoena. Before the client consents to formal diagnosis for healthcare coverage reasons, the counselor and client must collaboratively weight out the benefits and limitations of this formal documentation. <br><a data-href=\"Gender Assignment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gender Assignment</a>: At birth, doctors make an initial assessment of gender as either female or male <br><a data-href=\"Gender Identity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/gender-identity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gender Identity</a>: A category of social identity and refers to an individual's identification as male, female, or occasionally, some category other than male and female <br><a data-href=\"Cisgender\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cisgender</a>: When assigned gender and gender identity match <br><a data-href=\"Gender Expansiveness\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gender Expansiveness</a>: There are many ways people can express and identify their gender expansiveness, such as gender nonconforming, gender queer, nonbinary, or a variety of other terms that indicate a gender identity falls outside of the traditional options of only male and female. <br><a data-href=\"Gender Transition\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gender Transition</a>: Where persons take social and often medical steps to be seen externally as their gender identity.

The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society. Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal. The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change. The -isms all work to establish a defined norm or standard of rightness under which everyone is judged. This defined norm is backed up with individual and institutional violence which makes the oppression possible. The defined norm is a notion that all of us might accept and promote for various reasons probably connected to a sense of inferiority or economic vulnerability. 'Whiteness as Poverty' argues that law has come to embody and legitimize benefits that accrue to citizens just because they are right. Despite the end to formal racial discrimination in the legal system race matters in how the law is carried out. Due to the embedded racism in American society, Whiteness can be considered a property interest. Right of Possession\nRight to Use and Enjoyment\nRight to Disposition\nRight of Exclusion Critics of Harris' argument suggest that distributive justice sets up harm for the dominant group (in this case whites). Harris argues, \"Acknowledging Black identity does not involve the systematic subordination of whites, nor does it even set up a danger of doing so.\" <br><a data-href=\"Equality\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/equality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Equality</a> Treating everyone the same (aims to promote fairness) <br><a data-href=\"Equity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/diversity/equity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Equity</a> Giving everyone what they need to be successful (may appear unfair) A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)\nFor all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. This occurs when social structures that create and organize different social groups, e.g., gender and race, interact to produce effects that may not be intended. Example: Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment. This occurs when the political movements working towards justice for different groups, e.g., feminism and antiracism, interact to exclude or marginalize the interests of some subset of the groups, or reinforced another form of injustice. Examples: For women of color anti-racist and feminist political agendas often conflict with one another\nThis is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism. A concept that refers to the cultural construction of an identity, including the production and the contemporary critiques of the identity. This occurs when images or tropes are taken to be representative of the group ignore or distort the complexity of the group. <br>\"Representational intersectionality would include both the ways in which these images are produced through a confluence of prevalent narrative of race and gender, as well as the recognition of how contemporary critiques of racist and sexist representations marginalize women of color.\" (<a data-href=\"@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991</a>, p. 1283) The experience of being a member of more than one social group that cannot be decomposed into the experience of being a member of each. Example: The experience of being a Black woman is not just the experience of being Black and the experience of being a woman. The experience of being a Black woman is a proper compound of the two. Critical Race Theory (CRT) states that, 'Racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental categorization, attitude and discourse.' (Stefancic and Delgado, 2012, p. 21) and it challenges the 'ontological and epistemological biases subtly inculcated in the law, policies, or in empirical research that would otherwise hinter contextualization of harm and dysfunction resulting from racial stratification.' (Brown, 2003, p. 294) CRT helps focus our attention on the recursive interactions between institutionalized and interpersonal discrimination. Through the application of CRT to counseling and psychotherapy it is possible to interrogate the Eurocentric, ethnocentric and individualistic ways in which mental health practices are undertaken. Clients in need of psychological support can then be given a safe space for them to explore (in their own vernacular if necessary) their experiences of living in a capitalistic, racist, and misogynistic world.

The aim is to deepen engagement and mutual understanding in hopes of working and healing together. Informed by evidenced-based theories and tools, the KCCM emphasizes the following: Understanding barriers to constructive conversations\nSelf-awareness and regulation\nValues as anchors\nPersonal skills development\nHealing in relationship connection The KCCM Goal\nBarriers\nValues\nOpeners\nTake Action\nListen\nRespond\nRepeat Use both clinician skill and client perspective to understand the problem\nCollaborate and jointly define the problem. Jointly formulate a hypothesis regarding the cause of the problem. Jointly develop ways to confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis on the problem, continuing to consider alternative hypotheses. Test out the hypothesis using both the client and the therapist as evaluators. If the conceptualization appears to be valid, develop a treatment plan. If the hypothesis is not borne out, jointly collect additional data and formulate new, testable hypotheses. Deliberate practice is individualized training activities specially designed by a coach or teacher to improve specific aspects of an individual's performance through repetition and successive refinement. Deliberate practice is an evidenced-based method of skill development.\nDeliberate practice works best when training targets each student's personal skill thresholds or current ability. If a deliberate practice exercise is either too easy or too hard, the student is unlikely to benefit from it.\nTo maximize training productivity, performers follow a 'challenging but not overwhelming' training principle. This means that deliberate practice requires ongoing assessment of the student's current skill and tailoring the difficulty of exercises to consistently target a 'good enough' challenge. Skill Criteria for Attention to Diversity Convey a brief empathic response to a client/family member that indicates you hear their problem or the session content. Reflect on the problem/session content, looking for opportunities to deepen the conversation as it relates to their identity and unique experiences. Ask a question that conveys continued empathy and curiosity about their identity and unique experiences with the problem.

In other words, it refers to people who lived there before colonists or settlers arrived, defined new borders, and began to occupy the land. The term 'indigeneity' has emerged to describe the state of being indigenous or related to Indigenous-ness. There are over 476 million indigenous people living in 90 countries across the world, accounting for 6.2% of the global population: Of those, there are more than 5,000 distinct groups.

White feminist lens (i.e., White binary, heterosexual perspective, Patriarchy, and sexism) Postmodern approach to gender (still binary and biologically determined) Fmaily therapy theory rests on normative concepts of the traditional family and idealized conceptions of family relationships. Inequalities in the family associated with gender have been regarded as of little importance to the development of macro theory in the field. The two most influential therapeutic models, psychodynamic and systemic approaches, are each marked by gender bias. Feminist therapy is an integrative approach to psychotherapy that focused on the challenges that women face as a result of bias, stereotyping, oppression, discrimination, and other factors, and how those stressors can negatively affect their mental health. 'Feminist Family Therapy is the application of feminist theory and values to family therapy.' Acknowledge and examine the roles of values in therapy for both the therapist and the client (s).\nIntentionally introduce a discussion of gender into the therapy process using clinical language and techinques that acknowledge experiences across genders. Assess power inequalities in relationships rather than assuming equity in relationships. Include discussion of individual choice and responsibility in conceptualizations of family dynamics. Honor and appreciate the diversity inherent to families. Consider the clinical implications of interventions on both the family and on individual members of the family. Work actively to reduce power inequalities between therapist and client. (Leslie &amp; Southard 2009) According to intersectional feminists, there is not enough emphasis on the intersection of patriarchy with other factors, such as race, religion, and class. Intersectional feminists argue that other types of feminism assume that all women are exploited in the same way in the family.

This may include checking in at each session and using a different name and pronoun when their family is present if this is more comfortable for them. Explore the power in the system and the political climate in which you are seeing a TGNDB person.

Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart\nLike most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. While the 13 th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries. We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community. We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.\nWe mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them.

In 2020, a larger percentage of older men (70%) than older women (48%) were married. Of older adults age 65+ living in the community, 61% lived with their spouse/partner in 2020. About 27% lived alone The 2019 median income of older persons was $27,398 ($36, 921 for men and $21,815 for women)\nIn 2019, 4.9 million people age 65+ lived below the poverty level. Another 2.6 million were 'near-poor' The median household income of older homeowners was $36,200 in 2019. In 2020, 9.8 million Americans age 65+ were in the labor force (working or actively seeking work). Consumers age 65+ averaged out-of-pocket health care expenditures of $6,833 in 2019, up 41% from 2009. In 2019, about 1.1 million people age 60+ were responsible for the basic needs of at least one grandchild under age 18 living with them. During COVID-19, between March and April 2020, the unemployment rate for adults age 65+ more than quadrupled.

How can we think about care with older adults as suicide prevention?\nAs clinicians, what can we do to address the physical limitations that an older adult client may face to make sure these challenges do not impede the treatment process? 26% of adults in the US have some types of disability (61 million)\n2 in 5 adults age 65 years and older have a disability\n1 in 4 women have a disability\n2 in 5 non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaskan Natives have a disability\nAdults living with disabilities are more likely to be obese, smoke, and have heart disease and diabetes. 1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years do not have a usual health care provider\n1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years have an unmet healthcare need because of cost in the past year\n1 in 4 adults with disabilities 45 to 64 years did not have a routine check-up in the past year. Over 3 million children (4.3% of the under-18 population) in the US had a disability in 2019. The most common disability type among children both years was cognitive difficulty\nAmerican Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) children had the highest rate of childhood disability of all racial groups, at 5.9% in 2019. In the moral model (or religious), disability is seen as having meaning about the person's or family's character, deeds, thoughts, and karma. From this perspective, disability can carry stigma, shame and blame, particularly if the disability is seen as a mark of wrongdoing. It can also be seen as a sign of honor, faith, or strength (although this is less common)\nThe moral model is very prevalent worldwide and is often depicted in the media The Medical model views disability as resulting from an individual person's physical or mental limitations\nThe Medical Model focuses on find a 'cure' or making a person more 'normal'\nThe Medical Model uses the terms 'Disability,' 'Disease,' 'Dysfunctional,' 'Disorder' to categorize type of symptoms, differences in mechanisms, below average based on standardized measure of functioning, that causes challenges in life. “Pasted image 20240410205740.jpg” could not be found.

We must consider how we can become better allies for individuals with disabilities by ensuring that society is accessible (Social Model)\nWe must examine how we interact with and view people with disabilities..

Due to added caregiving responsibilities that are necessary for individuals with disabilities, members of families affected by disabilities have an increased prevalence of physical, psychological, and relational distress. Parents, spouses, and siblings of children with disabilities experience higher rates of mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression. Caregivers have higher rates of health problems and reports a variety of physical symptoms such as migraines, heart conditions, and sleep problems. The mental and physical health effects lead to reports of decreased quality of life and general wellbeing. Many of the adverse physical, mental, and relational health effects described by family members of individuals with disabilities are compounded by a lack of social support. Families often explain that there is a notable deficit in available social support, which they generally attribute to two main reasons: Family members’ lack of free time to socialize with friends and family due to the added caregiving responsibilities\nSocietal stigma associated with disabilities that may be attributed to personal shame and embarrassment of family members or the disapproval and ostracization by others Clinicians working with families affected by disabilities can support caregivers by connecting them with appropriate online platforms to increase social support, which acts as a protective factor against the harmful effects of caregiver stress and burnout.

Its cutting-edge presentation of multicultural counseling and therapy (MCT) is used in an overwhelming majority of graduate training programs in counseling and clinical psychology, and it has produced generations of culturally sensitive mental health practitioners. It now forms the multicultural knowledge base of licensing and certification exams at both the masters and the doctoral levels in psychology. In 2021, Social Science Space identified the book as one of the most important works across social science disciplines that has contributed to the ongoing need to understand, analyze, resist, and dismantle racism, bias, and bigotry.

CCD upholds the highest standards of scholarship, and is the most frequently cited source in multicultural psychology and mental health. The expert and global perspectives of the four co-authors, each active researchers and practitioners in the field, strengthen the newly minted ninth edition of CCD.

Accreditation and Legal Issues","icon":"","description":" The idea of first year student being paired up with a second year therapist to help guide. Working with agencies? No surprises act: Giving clients an estimate about how much they are going to pay for services Struggle with terminating services. As long as file is open, you are legally their therapist. Case is closed because once the case is closed you are no longer their therapist. They can always come back. What will be different for you when we are ready to move on? What does it need to be life for this to end? We make a mistake of not planting that seed early on. When clients start thinking of me as a person, such as asking questions. When you are no longer in the therapist role, when you stop becoming a person's therapist and become a person to them. They begin to see you as yourself rather than a therapist. If you have not scheduled within 30 days, we would terminate and close their case. They can always call back. Purpose of accreditation: Ensure the quality of marriage and family therapy programs. Accredited programs meet or exceed all standards for accreditation. Standards for Accreditation: Version 12.5 Outcome Based Education (You have to show that your people are meeting target): Vs input based (You offer these courses, your people are confident). 360 Quality and Improvement Review Process\nStart with Program goals, then student learning outcomes, and then targets for those outcomes. Review and gather data to show that you are meeting the targets or not and what you are doing to change the program to allow students to meet the SLO's If programs are accredited, licensure boards typically accept that they meet the educational requirements and client contact contact hour requirements for licensure (again, typically, always check with the state board) State of Ohio -&gt; 500 hour requirement\nBoard -&gt; 300 hour requirement Set standards for what adequate education and training is in the field. Protect students in those programs, knowing that they are able to be licensed in their state with that education, and protects the public in general, knowing that a therapist who graduated from an accredited program has the education and training needed to provide the service. Legal Age for Marriage in Ohio: 16 What are the Marriage Age Requirement Laws in Ohio? While females in Ohio may get married as young as 16 with the consent of both parents, only a juvenile court (in limiting cases) may consent to a marriage involving a male under 18. Same-sex marriage has been 'legal' and recognized in Ohio since 2015. Parentage: A man is presumed to be the natural father of a child in certain circumstances, including: The man and the child's mother are or have been married to each other, and the child is born during the marriage or is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated.\nAn acknowledgement of paternity has been filed pursuant to Sec. 3111.23\nThe term 'Punative Father' means a man, including one under age 18, who may be a child's father and to whom all of the following apply. He is not married to the child's mother at the time of the child's conception or birth. He has not adopted the child. He has not been determined, prior to the date a petition to adopt the child is filed, to have a parent and child relationship with the child by a court proceeding or an administrative agency proceeding. He has not acknowledged paternity of the child pursuant to Sec. 3111.21 to 3111.35. Understanding Divorce and Custody Issues: Dissolution vs. Divorce: Dissolution is when both parties can agree on all matters pertaining to separation (i.e., no fault divorce).\nDivorce is when both parties can't come to an agreement. To get a no-fault divorce, you need to state in the Complaint for Divorce that 'that the parties are incompatible,' or 'the parties have been living separate and apart without cohabitation for 1 year.' The grounds of being incompatible can be defeated if your spouse denies incompatibility.\nThe fault-based grounds for divorce are bigamy, willful absence of the other party for 1 year, adultery, extreme cruelty, fraudulent contract, gross neglect of duty, habitual drunkness, imprisonment in a state or federal prison at the time of filing, and when the divorce decree of another state does not use any of these, since they had complexity to the process by requiring proof. If parties don't agree about custody agreements, the judge will decide based on child's best interest: The wishes of the parties,\nThe wishes of the child, if the judge interviewed the child in private, The child's adjustment to home, school, and community,\nThe mental and physical health of all persons involved, You may get subpoenaed, good idea to contact attorney and ask. If private practice, have attorney on retainer, The party more likely to honor and facilitate parenting time rights,\nWhether either party failed to make all child support payments, including arrearages,\nWhether either party or a household member was a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect, or a violent or sexually oriented offense involving a member of the family,\nWhether either party has continuously and willfully, denied the other party's rights to parenting time in accordance with an an order of the court,\nWhether either party has, or has plans to, establish a residence outside of Ohio. Other Considerations: The ability of the parties to cooperate and make decisions jointly,\nEach party's ability to encourage contact between the child and the other party,\nAny history of, or potential for, child abuse, domestic violence, or parental kidnapping,\nThe geographic proximity of the parties to each other, The recommendation of any guardian ad litem of the child Child support is determined by reference to the Ohio Child Support Guidelines and includes a chart to calculate the child's needs based upon the combined income of the parties. For example, if the combined income of you and your spouse is $96,000 Recommend learn the laws around divorce and custody in the state you are located in. Don't. (I am not unbiased) (There are training programs for this)\nIf you decide you want to do that work, then you are not also the therapist for the parties involved. Sometimes you may be asked to testify based on the work you have done with one of the parents, do your best not to. You can put that into your consent form, although might not be considered a legal document. Whenever there is a divorce with custody agreements about children, then you need to review those custody agreements and get the consent of parents who share custody with their children. If a parent has sole custody then their consent is enough. If there is shared custody, then both parents must provide consent to treatment, unless there is a stipulation in the custody agreement that says otherwise. You can work with child and parent of up to 6 session without consent.

MFTs are concerned with developing laws and regulations pertaining to MFT that serve the public interest, and with altering such laws and regulations that are not in the public interest. MFTs also encourage public participation in the design and delivery of professional services and in the regulation of practitioners. ==**Seeking Consultation: The absence of an explicit reference to a specific behavior or situation in the Code does not meant that the behavior is ethical or unethical\nMFTs who are uncertain about the ethics should seek counsel from consultants, attorneys, supervisors, colleagues, or other appropriate authorities ==**Ethical Decision-Making: If the AAMFT Code of Ethics prescribes a standard higher than that required by law, MFTs must meet the higher standard of the AAMFT Code of Ethics. MFTs comply with the mandates of law, but make known their commitment to the AAMFT Code of Ethics and take steps to resolve the conflict in a responsible manner. MFTs remain accountable to the AAMFT Code of Ethics when acting as members or employees of organizations. MFTs make known to the organization their commitment to the AAMFT Code of Ethics and resolve any conflict in a way that allows the fullest adherence to the Code of Ethics ==**Binding Expectations: The AAMFT Code of Ethics is binding on members of AAMFT in all membership categories, all AAMFT Approved Supervisors and all applicants for membership or the Approved Supervisor designation. AAMFT members have an obligation to be familiar with the AAMFT Code of Ethics and its application to their professional service.\nLack of awareness or misunderstanding of an ethical standard is not a defense to a charge of unethical conduct. ==**Resolving Complaints: The process for filing, investigating, and resolving complains of unethical conduct is described in the current AAMFT Procedures for Handling Ethical Matters. Persons Accused are considered innocent by the Ethics Committee until proven guilty, except as otherwise provided, and are entitled to due process. If an AAMFT member resigns in anticipation of, or during the course of, an ethics investigation, the Ethics Committee will complete its investigation. Any publication of action taken by the Association will include the fact that the member attempted to resign during the investigation. ==**Aspirational Core Values: These values are intended to provide an aspirational framework within which MFTs may pursue the highest goals of practice. ==___The core values of AAMFT embody: Acceptance, appreciation, and inclusion of a diverse membership. Distinctiveness and excellence in training of MFTs and those desiring to advance their skills, knowledge, and expertise in systemic and relational therapies. Responsiveness and excellence in service to members. Diversity, equity, and excellence in clinical practice, research, education, and administration. Integrity evidence by a high threshold of ethical and honest behavior within Association governance and by members. Innovation and the advancement of knowledge of systemic and relational therapies. ==**Ethical Standards: Ethical standards are rules of practice upon which the MFT is obliged and judged. ==**Responsibility to Clients: MFTs advance the welfare of families and individuals and make reasonable efforts to find the appropriate balance between conflicting goals within the family system. ***1.1 Non-Discrimination: MFTs provide professional assistance to persons without discrimination on the basis of race, age, ethnicity, SES, disability, gender, health status, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or relationship status. ***1.2 Informed Consent: MFTs obtain appropriate informed consent to therapy or related procedures and use language that is reasonably understandable to clients. When persons, due to age or mental status, are legally incapable of giving informed consent.\nInformed consent generally necessitates that the client: Has the capacity to consent\nHas been adequately informed of significant information concerning treatment processes and procedures\nHas been adequately informed of potential risks and benefits of treatments for which generally recognized standards do not yet exist\nHas freely and without undue influence expressed consent\nHas provided consent that is appropriately documented\n(Verbal consent can be for a little while, e-document can be used for informed consent) ***1.3 Multiple Relationships: MFTs are aware of their influential positions with respect to clients, and they avoid exploiting the trust and dependency of such persons. MFTs make every effort to avoid conditions and multiple relationships with clients that could impair professional judgement or increase the risk of exploitation.\nWhen the risk of impairment or exploitation exists due to conditions or multiple roles, therapists document the appropriate precautions taken.\n(Don't observe people you know) **1.4 Sexual Intimacy with Current Clients and Others: Sexual intimacy with current clients or with known members of the client's family system is prohibited. (may want to talk to supervisor if suspect, protecting our profession by reporting) ***1.5 Sexual Intimacy with Former Clients and Others: Sexual intimacy with former clients or with known members of the client's family system is prohibited. ***1.6: Reports of Unethical Conduct: MFTs comply with applicable laws regarding the reporting of *alleged unethical conduct. **1.7 Abuse of the Therapeutic Relationship: MFTs do not abuse their power in therapeutic relationships. **1.8 Client Autonomy in Decision Making: MFTs respect the rights of clients to make decisions and help them to understand the consequences of these decisions. MFTs clearly advise clients that clients have the responsibility to make decisions regarding relationships such as cohabitation, marriage, divorce, separation, reconciliation, custody, and visitation. (We may be lulled in to helping our clients solve their problems, but that is not our job) **1.9 Relationship Beneficial to Client: MFTs continue therapeutic relationships only so long as it is reasonably clear that clients are benefiting from the relationship. **1.10: Referrals: MFTs respectfully assist persons in obtaining appropriate therapeutic services if the therapist is unable or unwilling to provide professional help.\n(Maintaining beneficial relationship but also could not abandon clients) ***1.11 Non-Abandonment: MFTs do not abandon or neglect clients in treatment without making reasonable arrangements for the continuation of treatment. () ***1.12 Written Consent to Record: MFTs obtain written informed consent from clients before recording any images or audio or permitting third-party observation. ***1.13 Relationships with Third Parties: MFTs, upon agreeing to provide services or entity at the request of a third party, clarify, to the extent feasible and at the outset of the service, the nature of the relationship with each party and the limits of confidentiality. ==**Confidentiality: MFTs have unique confidentiality concerns because the client in a therapeutic relationship may be more than one person. Therapists respect and guard the confidences of each individual client. ***2.1 Disclosing Limits of Confidentiality: MFTs disclose to clients and other interested parties at the outset of services the nature of confidentiality and possible limitations of the clients' right to confidentiality. Circumstances may necessitate repeated disclosures. ***2.2 Written Authorization to Release Client Information: MFTs do not disclose client confidences except by written authorization or waiver, or where mandated or permitted by law. Verbal authorization will not be sufficient except in emergency situations, unless prohibited by law. MFT does not disclose information outside the treatment context without a written authorization from each individual competent to execute a waiver. MFT may not reveal any individual's confidences to others in the client unit without the prior written permission of that individual. ***2.3 Client Access to Records: MFTs provide clients with reasonable access to records concerning the clients. MFT does not provide access to records (family/couple) without a written authorization from each individual competent to execute a waiver. MFTs limit client's access to their records only in exceptional circumstances when they are concerned, based on compelling evidence, that such access could cause serious harm to the client. The client's request and the rationale for withholding some or all of the record should be documented in the client's file. MFTs take steps to protect the confidentiality of other individuals identified in client records. ***2.4 Confidentiality in Non-Clinical Activities: MFTs use client and/or clinical materials in teaching, writing, consulting, research, and public presentations only if a written waiver had been obtained in accordance with Standard 2.2, or when appropriate steps have been taken to protect client identity and confidentiality. ***2.5 Protection of Records: MFTs store, safeguard, and dispose of client records in ways that maintain confidentiality and safeguard the welfare of clients. ***2.6 Preparation for Practice Changes: In preparation for moving a practice, closing a practice, or death, marriage and family therapists arrange for the storage, transfer, or disposal of client records in conformance with applicable laws and in ways that maintain confidentiality and safeguard the welfare of clients. ***2.7 Confidentiality in Consultations: Marriage and family therapists, when consulting with colleagues or referral sources, do not share confidential information that could reasonably lead to the identification of a client, research participant, supervisee, or other person with whom they have a confidential relationship unless they have obtained the prior written consent of the client, research participant, supervisee, or other person with whom they have a confidential relationship. Information may be shared only to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes of the consultation **==Professional Competence and Integrity Marriage and family therapists maintain high standards of professional competence and integrity. ***3.1 Maintenance of Competency: Marriage and family therapists pursue knowledge of new developments and maintain their competence in marriage and family therapy through education, training, and/or supervised experience. ***3.2 Knowledge of Regulatory Standards: Marriage and family therapists pursue appropriate consultation and training to ensure adequate knowledge of and adherence to applicable laws, ethics, and professional standards. ***3.3 Seek Assistance: Marriage and family therapists seek appropriate professional assistance for issues that may impair work performance or clinical judgment. 3.4 Conflicts of Interest: Marriage and family therapists do not provide services that create a conflict of interest that may impair work performance or clinical judgment. ***3.5 Maintenance of Records: Marriage and family therapists maintain accurate and adequate clinical and financial records in accordance with applicable law. ***3.6 Development of New Skills: While developing new skills in specialty areas, marriage and family therapists take steps to ensure the competence of their work and to protect clients from possible harm. Marriage and family therapists practice in specialty areas new to them only after appropriate education, training, and/or supervised experience. ***3.7 Harassment: Marriage and family therapists do not engage in sexual or other forms of harassment of clients, students, trainees, supervisees, employees, colleagues, or research subjects. ***3.8 Exploitation: Marriage and family therapists do not engage in the exploitation of clients, students, trainees, supervisees, employees, colleagues, or research subjects. ***3.9 Gifts: Marriage and family therapists attend to cultural norms when considering whether to accept gifts from or give gifts to clients. Marriage and family therapists consider the potential effects that receiving or giving gifts may have on clients and on the integrity and efficacy of the therapeutic relationship. ***3.10 Scope of Competence: Marriage and family therapists do not diagnose, treat, or advise on problems outside the recognized boundaries of their competencies. ***3.11 Public Statements: Marriage and family therapists, because of their ability to influence and alter the lives of others, exercise special care when making public their professional recommendations and opinions through testimony or other public statements. ***3.12 Professional Misconduct: Marriage and family therapists may be in violation of this Code and subject to termination of membership or other appropriate action if they: (a) are convicted of any felony; (b) are convicted of a misdemeanor related to their qualifications or functions; (c) engage in conduct which could lead to conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor related to their qualifications or functions; (d) are expelled from or disciplined by other professional organizations; (e) have their licenses or certificates suspended or revoked or are otherwise disciplined by regulatory bodies; (f) continue to practice marriage and family therapy while no longer competent to do so because they are impaired by physical or mental causes or the abuse of alcohol or other substances; or (g) fail to cooperate with the Association at any point from the inception of an ethical complaint through the completion of all proceedings regarding that complaint Responsibility to Students and Supervisees Marriage and family therapists do not exploit the trust and dependency of students and supervisees. ***4.1 Exploitation. Marriage and family therapists who are in a supervisory role are aware of their influential positions with respect to students and supervisees, and they avoid exploiting the trust and dependency of such persons. Therapists, therefore, make every effort to avoid conditions and multiple relationships that could impair professional objectivity or increase the risk of exploitation. When the risk of impairment or exploitation exists due to conditions or multiple roles, therapists take appropriate precautions. ***4.2 Therapy with Students or Supervisees. Marriage and family therapists do not provide therapy to current students or supervisees. ***4.3 Sexual Intimacy with Students or Supervisees. Marriage and family therapists do not engage in sexual intimacy with students or supervisees during the evaluative or training relationship between the therapist and student or supervisee. ***4.4 Oversight of Supervisee Competence. Marriage and family therapists do not permit students or supervisees to perform or to hold themselves out as competent to perform professional services beyond their training, level of experience, and competence. ***4.5 Oversight of Supervisee Professionalism. Marriage and family therapists take reasonable measures to ensure that services provided by supervisees are professional. ***4.6 Existing Relationship with Students or Supervisees: Marriage and family therapists are aware of their influential positions with respect to supervisees, and they avoid exploiting the trust and dependency of such persons. Supervisors, therefore, make every effort to avoid conditions and multiple relationships with supervisees that could impair professional judgment or increase the risk of exploitation. Examples of such relationships include, but are not limited to, business or close personal relationships with supervisees or the supervisee’s immediate family. When the risk of impairment or exploitation exists due to conditions or multiple roles, supervisors document the appropriate precautions taken. ***4.7 Confidentiality with Supervisees: Marriage and family therapists do not disclose supervisee confidences except by written authorization or waiver, or when mandated or permitted by law. In educational or training settings where there are multiple supervisors, disclosures are permitted only to other professional colleagues, administrators, or employers who share responsibility for training of the supervisee. Verbal authorization will not be sufficient except in emergency situations, unless prohibited by law. ***4.8 Payment for Supervision: Marriage and family therapists providing clinical supervision shall not enter into financial arrangements with supervisees through deceptive or exploitative practices, nor shall marriage and family therapists providing clinical supervision exert undue influence over supervisees when establishing supervision fees. Marriage and family therapists shall also not engage in other exploitative practices of supervisees. ==**Research and Publication: Marriage and family therapists respect the dignity and protect the welfare of research participants, and are aware of applicable laws, regulations, and professional standards governing the conduct of research. ***5.1 Institutional Approval: When institutional approval is required, marriage and family therapists submit accurate information about their research proposals and obtain appropriate approval prior to conducting the research ***5.2 Protection of Research Participants: Marriage and family therapists are responsible for making careful examinations of ethical acceptability in planning research. To the extent that services to research participants may be compromised by participation in research, marriage and family therapists seek the ethical advice of qualified professionals not directly involved in the investigation and observe safeguards to protect the rights of research participants. ***5.3 Informed Consent to Research. Marriage and family therapists inform participants about the purpose of the research, expected length, and research procedures. They also inform participants of the aspects of the research that might reasonably be expected to influence willingness to participate such as potential risks, discomforts, or adverse effects. Marriage and family therapists are especially sensitive to the possibility of diminished consent when participants are also receiving clinical services, or have impairments which limit understanding and/or communication, or when participants are children. Marriage and family therapists inform participants about any potential research benefits, the limits of confidentiality, and whom to contact concerning questions about the research and their rights as research participants. ***5.4 Right to Decline or Withdraw Participation: Marriage and family therapists respect each participant’s freedom to decline participation in or to withdraw from a research study at any time. This obligation requires special thought and consideration when investigators or other members of the research team are in positions of authority or influence over participants. Marriage and family therapists, therefore, make every effort to avoid multiple relationships with research participants that could impair professional judgment or increase the risk of exploitation. When offering inducements for research participation, marriage and family therapists make reasonable efforts to avoid offering inappropriate or excessive inducements when such inducements are likely to coerce participation. ***5.5 Confidentiality of Research Data. Information obtained about a research participant during the course of an investigation is confidential unless there is a waiver previously obtained in writing. When the possibility exists that others, including family members, may obtain access to such information, this possibility, together with the plan for protecting confidentiality, is explained as part of the procedure for obtaining informed consent. ***5.6 Publication. Marriage and family therapists do not fabricate research results. Marriage and family therapists disclose potential conflicts of interest and take authorship credit only for work they have performed or to which they have contributed. Publication credits accurately reflect the relative contributions of the individual involved. ***5.7 Authorship of Student Work. Marriage and family therapists do not accept or require authorship credit for a publication based from student’s research, unless the marriage and family therapist made a substantial contribution beyond being a faculty advisor or research committee member. Co-authorship on student research should be determined in accordance with principles of fairness and justice. ***5.8 Plagiarism. Marriage and family therapists who are the authors of books or other materials that are published or distributed do not plagiarize or fail to cite persons to whom credit for original ideas or work is due. ***5.9 Accuracy in Publication. Marriage and family therapists who are authors of books or other materials published or distributed by an organization take reasonable precautions to ensure that the published materials are accurate and factual. Therapy, supervision, and other professional services engaged in by marriage and family therapists take place over an increasing number of technological platforms. There are great benefits and responsibilities inherent in both the traditional therapeutic and supervision contexts, as well as in the utilization of technologically-assisted professional services. This standard addresses basic ethical requirements of offering therapy, supervision, and related professional services using electronic means\n***6.1 Technology Assisted Services: Prior to commencing therapy or supervision services through electronic means (including but not limited to phone and Internet), marriage and family therapists ensure that they are compliant with all relevant laws for the delivery of such services. Additionally, marriage and family therapists must: (a) determine that technologically assisted services or supervision are appropriate for clients or supervisees, considering professional, intellectual, emotional, and physical needs; (b) inform clients or supervisees of the potential risks and benefits associated with technologically-assisted services; (c) ensure the security of their communication medium; and (d) only commence electronic therapy or supervision after appropriate education, training, or supervised experience using the relevant technology. 6.2 Consent to Treat or Supervise: Clients and supervisees, whether contracting for services as individuals, dyads, families, or groups, must be made aware of the risks and responsibilities associated with technology-assisted services. Therapists are to advise clients and supervisees in writing of these risks, and of both the therapist’s and clients’/supervisees’ responsibilities for minimizing such risks. ***6.3 Confidentiality and Professional Responsibilities: It is the therapist’s or supervisor’s responsibility to choose technological platforms that adhere to standards of best practices related to confidentiality and quality of services, and that meet applicable laws. Clients and supervisees are to be made aware in writing of the limitations and protections offered by the therapist’s or supervisor’s technology. ***6.4 Technology and Documentation: Therapists and supervisors are to ensure that all documentation containing identifying or otherwise sensitive information which is electronically stored and/or transferred is done using technology that adhere to standards of best practices related to confidentiality and quality of services, and that meet applicable laws. Clients and supervisees are to be made aware in writing of the limitations and protections offered by the therapist’s or supervisor’s technology. ***6.5 Location of Services and Practice: Therapists and supervisors follow all applicable laws regarding location of practice and services, and do not use technologically-assisted means for practicing outside of their allowed jurisdictions. ***6.6 Training and Use of Current Technology: Marriage and family therapists ensure that they are well trained and competent in the use of all chosen technology-assisted professional services. Careful choices of audio, video, and other options are made in order to optimize quality and security of services, and to adhere to standards of best practices for technology-assisted services. Furthermore, such choices of technology are to be suitably advanced and current so as to best serve the professional needs of clients and supervisees. Marriage and family therapists aspire to the highest of standards in providing testimony in various contexts within the legal system. ***7.1 Performance of Forensic Services: Marriage and family therapists may perform forensic services which may include interviews, consultations, evaluations, reports, and assessments both formal and informal, in keeping with applicable laws and competencies. ***7.2 Testimony in Legal Proceedings: Marriage and family therapists who provide expert or fact witness testimony in legal proceedings avoid misleading judgments, base conclusions and opinions on appropriate data, and avoid inaccuracies insofar as possible. When offering testimony, as marriage and family therapy experts, they shall strive to be accurate, objective, fair, and independent. ***7.3 Competence: Marriage and family therapists demonstrate competence via education and experience in providing testimony in legal systems ***7.4 Informed Consent: Marriage and family therapists provide written notice and make reasonable efforts to obtain written consents of persons who are the subject(s) of evaluations and inform clients about the evaluation process, use of information and recommendations, financial arrangements, and the role of the therapist within the legal system. ***7.5 Avoiding Conflicts: Clear distinctions are made between therapy and evaluations. Marriage and family therapists avoid conflict in roles in legal proceedings wherever possible and disclose potential conflicts. As therapy begins, marriage and family therapists clarify roles and the extent of confidentiality when legal systems are involved. ***7.6 Avoiding Dual Roles: Marriage and family therapists avoid providing therapy to clients for whom the therapist has provided a forensic evaluation and avoid providing evaluations for those who are clients, unless otherwise mandated by legal systems. ***7.7 Separation of Custody Evaluation from Therapy: Marriage and family therapists avoid conflicts of interest in treating minors or adults involved in custody or visitation actions by not performing evaluations for custody, residence, or visitation of the minor. Marriage and family therapists who treat minors may provide the court or mental health professional performing the evaluation with information about the minor from the marriage and family therapist’s perspective as a treating marriage and family therapist, so long as the marriage and family therapist obtains appropriate consents to release information. ***7.8 Professional Opinions: Marriage and family therapists who provide forensic evaluations avoid offering professional opinions about persons they have not directly interviewed. Marriage and family therapists declare the limits of their competencies and information. ***7.9 Changes in Service: Clients are informed if changes in the role of provision of services of marriage and family therapy occur and/or are mandated by a legal system. ***7.10 Familiarity with Rules: Marriage and family therapists who provide forensic evaluations are familiar with judicial and/ or administrative rules prescribing their roles. ==****Financial Arrangements: Marriage and family therapists make financial arrangements with clients, third-party payors, and supervisees that are reasonably understandable and conform to accepted professional practices. ***8.1 Financial Integrity: Marriage and family therapists do not offer or accept kickbacks, rebates, bonuses, or other remuneration for referrals. Fee-for-service arrangements are not prohibited. ***8.2 Disclosure of Financial Policies: Prior to entering into the therapeutic or supervisory relationship, marriage and family therapists clearly disclose and explain to clients and supervisees: (a) all financial arrangements and fees related to professional services, including charges for canceled or missed appointments; (b) the use of collection agencies or legal measures for nonpayment; and (c) the procedure for obtaining payment from the client, to the extent allowed by law, if payment is denied by the third-party payor. Once services have begun, therapists provide reasonable notice of any changes in fees or other charges. ***8.3 Notice of Payment Recovery Procedures: Marriage and family therapists give reasonable notice to clients with unpaid balances of their intent to seek collection by agency or legal recourse. When such action is taken, therapists will not disclose clinical information. ***8.4 Truthful Representation of Services: Marriage and family therapists represent facts truthfully to clients, third-party payors, and supervisees regarding services rendered ***8.5 Bartering: Marriage and family therapists ordinarily refrain from accepting goods and services from clients in return for services rendered. Bartering for professional services may be conducted only if: (a) the supervisee or client requests it; (b) the relationship is not exploitative; (c) the professional relationship is not distorted; and (d) a clear written contract is established. ***8.6 Withholding Records for Non-Payment: Marriage and family therapists may not withhold records under their immediate control that are requested and needed for a client’s treatment solely because payment has not been received for past services, except as otherwise provided by law. ==***Advertising: Marriage and family therapists engage in appropriate informational activities, including those that enable the public, referral sources, or others to choose professional services on an informed basis. ***9.1 Accurate Professional Representation Marriage and family therapists accurately represent their competencies, education, training, and experience relevant to their practice of marriage and family therapy in accordance with applicable law. ***9.2 Promotional Materials. Marriage and family therapists ensure that advertisements and publications in any media are true, accurate, and in accordance with applicable law. ***9.3 Professional Affiliations: Marriage and family therapists do not hold themselves out as being partners or associates of a firm if they are not. ***9.4 Professional Identification: Marriage and family therapists do not use any professional identification (such as a business card, office sign, letterhead, Internet, or telephone or association directory listing) if it includes a statement or claim that is false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive. ***9.5 Educational Credentials: Marriage and family therapists claim degrees for their clinical services only if those degrees demonstrate training and education in marriage and family therapy or related fields. ***9.6 Employee or Supervisee Qualifications: Marriage and family therapists make certain that the qualifications of their employees and supervisees are represented in a manner that is true, accurate, and in accordance with applicable law. ***9.7 Specialization: Marriage and family therapists represent themselves as providing specialized services only after taking reasonable steps to ensure the competence of their work and to protect clients, supervisees, and others from harm. ***9.8 Correction of Misinformation: Marriage and family therapists correct, wherever possible, false, misleading, or inaccurate information and representations made by others concerning the therapist’s qualifications, se ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Annotations:","level":3,"id":"Annotations_0"},{"heading":"Preamble:","level":2,"id":"Preamble_0"},{"heading":"Standard I:","level":2,"id":"Standard_I_0"},{"heading":"Standard II:","level":2,"id":"Standard_II_0"},{"heading":"Standard III (Professional Competence and Integrity):","level":2,"id":"Standard_III_(Professional_Competence_and_Integrity)_0"},{"heading":"Standard IV (Responsibility to Students and Supervisees):","level":2,"id":"Standard_IV_(Responsibility_to_Students_and_Supervisees)_0"},{"heading":"Standard V (Research and Publication):","level":2,"id":"Standard_V_(Research_and_Publication)_0"},{"heading":"Standard VI (Technology-Assisted Professional Services)","level":2,"id":"Standard_VI_(Technology-Assisted_Professional_Services)_0"},{"heading":"Standard VII (Professional Evaluations)","level":2,"id":"Standard_VII_(Professional_Evaluations)_0"},{"heading":"Standard VIII (Financial Arrangements)","level":2,"id":"Standard_VIII_(Financial_Arrangements)_0"},{"heading":"Standard IX (Advertising):","level":2,"id":"Standard_IX_(Advertising)_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/ethics-(7770)/readings/2.-aamft-code-of-ethics/@aamftcodeofethics2015.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1693487857471,"modifiedTime":1724752013954,"sourceSize":33856,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Ethics (7770)/Readings/2.

Part 1: Couple Relationship Ethics, Pragmatics, and Attachment\nYear: 2009\nCitekey: @butlerFacilitatedDisclosureClinical2009\nitemType: journalArticle\nJournal: Journal of Marital and Family Therapy\nVolume: 35\nIssue: 1\nPages: 125-143\nDOI: 10.1111/j.1752-0606.2008.00106.xA critical and potentially polarizing decision in treating infidelity is whether facilitating partner disclosure or accommodating nondisclosure is most beneficial following private disclosure of infidelity to the therapist. Given couple distress and volatility following disclosure, understandably some therapists judge accommodating an infidelity secret both efficient and compassionate. Employing Western ethics and an attachment ⁄ intimacy lens, we consider ethical, pragmatic, and attachment intimacy implications of accommodating infidelity secrets. Issues bearing on the decision to facilitate disclosure or accommodate nondisclosure include (a) relationship ethics and pragmatics; (b) attachment and intimacy consequences; and (c) prospects for healing. We conclude that facilitating voluntary disclosure of infidelity, although difficult and demanding, represents the most ethical action with the best prospects for renewed and vital attachment intimacy.\nA critical and potentially polarizing decision in treating infidelity is whether facilitating partner disclosure or accommodating nondisclosure is most beneficial following private disclosure of infidelity to the therapist.\nfacilitating voluntary disclosure of infidelity, although difficult and demanding, represents the most ethical action with the best prospects for renewed and vital attachment intimacy.\nThe damaging impact of affairs on the couple relationship as well as on the individual partners is significant, is ranked by therapists as second only to couple violence in its destructive effects, and is the single most predictor of divorce.\" (pg. 125) The relational therapy of MFTs should be responsive to infidelity secrets in a way that is (a) ethically defensible, both in terms of relationship ethics and therapy ethics (b) contextualized in theoretical understanding of relationship attachment dynamics (c) clinically sound, in terms of positive relationship outcomes that can be anticipated (d) clearly operationalized, describing the step-by-step clinical process protocol necessary to deal with repercussions particular to the therapist’s chosen approach to infidelity secrets.

The therapist’s response to one partner’s confidential revelation of an infidelity secret is critically important, as the subsequent unfolding of couple therapy is unavoidably and fundamentally shaped by this early decision. Within the couple relationship, choices related to an infidelity secret include: Full disclosure unilaterally ventured by the offending spouse\nPartial disclosure unilaterally determined by the offending spouse\nNondisclosure unilaterally determined by the offending spouse\nMeasured disclosure determined by the expressed desires of the non-offending spouse. The response to an infidelity secret is therefore likely to be a critical factor in therapy, determining the type of relationship outcomes that can potentially be achieved.\nTherapists’ preparation for and response to a confidentially disclosed infidelity secret represent a critical early turning point in the direction and course of couple treatment.\n-\nHighlight\nthe relational therapy of MFTs should be responsive to infidelity secrets in a way that is (a) ethically defensible, both in terms of relationship ethics and therapy ethics; (b) contextualized in theoretical understanding of relationship attachment dynamics; (c) clinically sound, in terms of positive relationship outcomes that can be anticipated; and (d) clearly operationalized, describing the step-by-step clinical process protocol necessary to deal with repercussions particular to the therapist’s chosen approach to infidelity secrets\n-\nHighlight\nthe overwhelming majority (96%) indicated they would maintain a confidentially disclosed infidelity secret\n-\nHighlight\nnot clear is the ethical and theoretical reasoning upon which therapists’ responses were based.\n-\nHighlight\nto facilitate therapists’ reflection concerning infidelity secrets, particularly specific to attachment-idealizing marriage.\n-\nHighlight\nprompt dialogue among therapists that will yield carefully considered clinical positions and specifically elaborated protocols for treating committed married couples where an attachment perspective is critical.\n-\nHighlight\nindividual rights in pair-bond relationships\n-\nHighlight\nindividuals possess inalienable rights to (a) relationship choice—to choose the relationships in which they are willing to participate and to be fully informed about information that bears on that choice; (b) relationship definition—to determine the ideals and goals for their relationships; and (c)\n-\nHighlight\nrelationship circumscription—to choose the relationship conditions that are acceptable to them, defining appropriate and inappropriate behavior within and outside the relationship, and establishing relational boundaries and stipulations for what each partner expects from the other.\n-\nHighlight\nethic of nonmaleficence\n-\nHighlight\nor ‘‘let us first do no harm,’’\n-\nHighlight\nethic of beneficence, or the idea that ethical behavior should benefit others,\n-\nHighlight\nDoes an infidelity secret do harm to the individual rights of the other partner?

A related aim is to raise and address some of the ethical issues that are inseparable from a consideration of family secrets. Secrets involve information that is either withheld or differentially shared between or among people.\nSecrets tend, for the most part, not to be about feelings or thoughts, but about facts, real happenings or incidents. Importance of what Boszormenyi-Nagy and his coworkers have described as the ethical-existential dimension of human life in close relationships. This dimension concerns the facts of a person's life and their impact on him/her and those in relationship with him/her, as well as the actions of each person toward one another, especially as they affect mutual debts, entitlements, and trustworthiness. The network of persons involved in the secret as the awareness context. Refers to the network as a whole and includes those who are unaware of the secret as well as those who know it. A fairly simple typology of secrets can be drawn from the kinds of boundaries created in the relational system. From this perspective, three major types of family secrets emerge: (a) individual secrets; (b) internal family secrets; and (c) shared family secrets. Individual secrets involve those cases in which one person keeps a secret from the other person or persons in the family. In both cases, one person's secret is shared with no one else in the family. The boundary formed by the secret is located between the person holding the secret and the other(s). Internal family secrets involve those cases in which at least two people keep a secret from at least one other. Internal family secrets create sub-groupings within the family. Shared family secrets involve those cases in which all members of the family know the secret but are pledged to keep it from persons outside the family. Shared family secrets strengthen the boundaries separating the family as a whole from the outside world. The person or persons who know and keep the secret can be referred to as the secret-holder(s) and the person who does not know the secret as the unaware.\nThe subject, meaning the person that the secret is about. Subject and secret-holder may be one and the same person, or they may be different.\nThe confusion that surrounds secrets may make it difficult in some cases to make absolute distinctions between knowing and not knowing a secret.\nFor some secret-holders, there may be absolute clarity about the fact that there is a secret, but others may be quite surprised to recognize the secret as such.\nThere is a need for a way to identify secrets, even when the secret-holder is unaware of them as such.\nThe therapist should immediately consider the possible existence of secrets any time the word \"know\" needs to be used more than once in a sentence either by the patient or the therapist. It is nearly impossible to overemphasize the significance of loyalty dynamics in the creation, maintenance, and eventual facing of secrets in families. Often, the secret-holder feels, or may actually be, \"sworn to silence.\" S/he owes it to the other person(s) to keep the secret. Disclosing the secret would be experienced as an act of betrayal and would arouse guilt over disloyalty. These cases concern dynamics of loyalty to the secret-holder(s). But the awareness context is further complicated by the fact that a secret-holder may also feel loyalty to the unaware.\nHighlight -\nHighlight\nBoszormenyi-Nagy has described as a \"split-loyalty pattern\"\n-\nHighlight\nloyalty dynamics can contribute to the creation and maintenance of family secrets that, in turn, are likely to generate or exacerbate split-loyalty patterns.\n-\nHighlight\nIn some cases of secrets, there is an element of \"one-upsmanship;\"; the secret-holder feels \"one-up\" on the unaware.\n-\nHighlight\nThe power dynamics implied here exist in more subtle and often much more destructive forms in nominally more mature relationships; the secret-holder gloats in his/her secret knowledge and the other's ignorance.\n-\nHighlight\nthe secret-holder has the threat of \"un-used ammunition.\"\n-\nHighlight\nThere is a dangerous and unstable tension inherent in these power dynamics of secrets because, in order to be able to savor the full effect of the secret, to squeeze every ounce of cruelty from it, the secret-holder must reveal it. Then s/he can see the reaction of the other person when s/he realizes s/he has been deceived. There is, therefore, an inherent instability in such patterns, always pressing toward destructive disclosures.\n-\nHighlight\nInternal family secrets create or strengthen boundaries and alliances within the family between secret-holders. Estrangements develop between secret-holders and the unaware in response to the secret-holder's inability or unwillingness to discuss the secret and to the deception or mystification that often follows in the wake of secrets.\n-\nHighlight\nA curious fact about secrets is that the boundaries created by them depend not only upon who knows the secret but knowing who knows.\n-\nHighlight\nthe boundary created between the two sons is just as real as that created between the secret-holder and the unaware, even though both know the secret.\n-\nHighlight\nWhen all members know the secret and, unlike the case above, know they all know, the secret serves to strengthen the boundary between the family and the outside world. In extreme cases, it may make alliances between family members and persons outside the family virtually impossible if they feel they can neither reveal the secret nor become involved emotionally without revealing the secret.\n-","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"I.

This paper provides a scoping review of the literature on how couple’s therapists handle secrets in the context of couple’s therapy and discusses the ethical and clinical considerations in the context of the ethical standards of the AAMFT. Online databases were used to systematically identify peer-reviewed academic, English-language articles that focused on recommendations for therapists in handling secrets between couples in therapy. Seven articles met the search criteria. The empirical evidence supports a model of professional judgment, whereby the therapist can use their discretion about whether or not to disclose a secret on behalf of a client. To operate within the confines of ethical practice, we recommend therapists pair professional judgment with a clearly informed and signed written client policy.\n<br>\n<a data-href=\"Self-Concealment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/self-concealment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Concealment</a>: Defined secrets as 'life experiences, personal facts, thoughts, or feelings intentionally not disclosed.'\nExamples include concealing personal negative or distressing information. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Disclosure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/disclosure.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Disclosure</a>: Influenced by trust in the therapist and believing that self-disclosure would be beneficial.\nPromotes healing and attachment, but final decision about disclosure should be left to offending spouse. Voluntary consent should be obtained at the outset of therapy to avoid jeopardizing trust and to remain an equal advocate for both partners. Possible exceptions to disclosure: Serious or terminal illness of injured spouse; imminent divorce; potential for violence; significant psychopathology in either partner; many years have passed, and issue is unrelated facilitated disclosure; it is ethical for therapists to collude in keeping secrets. Honesty is vital to recovery. After disclosure most couples choose the challenges of healing over divorce. Disclosure of infidelity is best course of action to resolve potential conflicts and improve working alliance toward couple healing and renewal. Through voluntary facilitated disclosure (based on the desires of aggrieved spouse) or referral, therapists should avoid double-bind of doing therapy in cases of non-disclosed secrets. The choice to disclose is subjective - one person may readily disclose what another might choose to conceal. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Withholding Information\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/withholding-information.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Withholding Information</a>: Though there is some literature on withholding information by the client within the context of individual therapy, the literature on the disclosure of secrets to the therapist by one member of a couple is quite sparse. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Secrets in CFT\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/secrets-in-cft.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Secrets in CFT</a>: Responsible handling of secrets between partners in couple's therapy is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems arising from the revelation, particularly due to the sensitive nature of secrets. Therapeutically, a secret has the potential to undermine the development of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the secret-disclosing partner if the secret is shared with the other member of the couple. Non-disclosure may also undermine the maintenance of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the other partner, who may perceive the therapist as triangulating with the secret holder, if the secret is not shared but arises later in the course of therapy. Additionally, there are potential ethical and legal problems that may emerge due to breaking the confidentiality of an individual through sharing a secret. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Family Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Systems Theory</a>: Based on the premise that the family or couple functions as a singular emotional unit.\nCouple system in FST considered a discrete subsystem within a family.

But can result in harm if the therapist, wittingly or unwittingly, colludes with one member of the couple. The conjoint process provides an opening for a couple to grow and learn from one another that is often lost in traditional individual approaches. The therapist may not reveal any individual’s confidences to others in the client unit without the prior written permission of that individual.

To add to this dilemma, therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients. As such, the purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Upon research, it became apparent that there is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Furthermore, there is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists’ decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients. Thus, this literature review presents the need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones’ culture can influence their beliefs.Purpose:\nThe purpose of this review is to determine the extent to which culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality\nThe purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.\nThe present study seeks to address this issue by considering the role of culture on the therapist’s decision to disclose as well as differences related to culture around clients’ feelings and expectations for privacy in therapy Introduction: Confidentiality in MFT can be complicated due to the various parties involved. (AAMFT) recommend that policies concerning confidentiality be discussed at the beginning of therapy during the informed consent process.\nA therapist is not allowed to reveal any individual’s confidence in the system-oriented therapy setting without the prior written permission of that individual. Gottlieb (1996) described four conceptually distinct variations of confidentiality that could be used with couples or families: 1) treat information disclosed individually as confidential; 2) inform each client that no information is confidential; 3) allow certain information to remain confidential as a matter of personal privacy; or 4) agree to allow certain information to be temporarily kept confidential, with the stipulation that it must be disclosed at a later time.\nMay have very serious implications depending on the client (or family/couple) scenario.\nin cases of couple and family treatment, the therapist should outline the rules of treatment, defining who the patients are, as well as confidentiality and any limitations.\nThere are no legal or professional ethics that directly address the issue of cultural mismatch.\nMaintaining confidentiality in family and couple’s therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties.\nTherapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients.\nThere is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.\nThere is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists’ decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients.\nNeed for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones’ culture can influence their beliefs.\nOne of the issues faced by therapists relates to whether or not secrets should be kept.\nRelational therapists’ supported facilitated disclosure of infidelity, so long as it was in an informed and voluntary manner.\nThe therapists felt that healing and attachment security were optimally achieved through disclosure.\nFindings revealed that therapists spent a great deal of time deciding how to handle secrets, used a “professional judgment” approach, and informed clients verbally of their confidentiality policy. Results also revealed that 25% of the sample noted that a couple was unhappy or expressed concern over the manner in which a secret was handled and that the approach used to deal with the secret was not predictive of the number of complaints lodged.\ndilemma faced by marriage and family therapists when a child discloses information that a counselor is mandated to report\nsuggest relying on sound professional judgment when deciding whether or not it is appropriate to breech confidentiality and suggest reviewing confidentiality and the limitations associated with it on an ongoing basis.\nEthical issues surrounding disclosures by minor children in marriage and family therapy is grossly understudied.\nMarriage and family therapists be aware of their state’s laws prior to breeching confidentiality.\nIn the event that a client is participating in illegal activity, the counselor should encourage the client to turn him or herself in to the proper authorities.\nShould a counselor choose to report a client’s illegal activity, the authors argue that he or she should refer the client to another therapist because the counselor has now become the accuser.\nFindings revealed differences in the ways of obtaining informed consent, approach to discussing confidentiality, information shared with parents or guardians, and the influence of client-specific factors on the management of confidentiality.\nTwo factors play a large role in the therapist’s decision to breech confidentiality: 1) the negative nature of the client’s behavior, and 2) the desire to maintain the therapeutic process.\nA small percentage of respondents were not informing their clients about confidentiality (and its limits) until a problem arose.\nThe author recommends review and discussion of written confidentiality policies with each client, the need for comprehensive written policies about limits to confidentiality that go beyond legally determined requirements to include collaborative relationships, third- party payers, and supervision, and training on ethical dilemmas related to confidentiality focusing on the areas identified in the study as areas of need including collaborative relationships, legal knowledge, and managed care.\nGrounded theory methodology revealed three main concepts: 1) defining who constitutes the therapy client, 2) maintaining privacy and confidentiality during the therapeutic process, and 3) handling private or secret disclosures made during individual breakout sessions.\nWhile some information is disclosed, other information typically considered important to the counseling relationship is not disclosed at the outset of therapy (e.g., limits of confidentiality, treatment risks).\nMany rehabilitation counselors do not fully inform their clients about the limits of confidentiality at the outset of counseling.\nParticipants’ view of privacy differed greatly from Western views and that the privacy protections used in the study created discomfort among participants.\nAny definition of privacy must take into account the cultural variations in defining and understanding this concept.\nConfidentiality is not a one-size fits all approach, particularly for practitioners working with a very diverse caseload.\nMore research is needed to directly assess cultural influences on the confidentiality.\nTherapists can take steps to ensure that they become more culturally competent.\nThey note that many Native Americans consider silence to be a sign of respect, and that they value careful listening. Some may even perceive too many questions as being rude or disrespectful, along with taking notes during an interview since it defers from vigilant listening.\nAsian American individuals may be less confrontational and yearn for harmonious relationships. They may also view direct eye contact as invasive, and may desire a level of formal respect.\nAs with Hispanic/Latin American individuals, religion may take prominence over therapy; the Catholic Church is very influential within this group, and often plays a vital role in helping individuals with mental health problems.\nSome Hispanic/Latin American individuals may believe that their mental health is out of their control, which may create issues in situations where a therapist needs to aid the individual in establishing a locus of control.\nIndividuals within cultures are very diverse, and it is unfair to assume that these guidelines will apply to every single person.\nIt is still imperative for therapists to have knowledge of the possible cultural influences, as this can undeniably affect the client-therapist relationship including, but not limited to, the confidentiality process.\nThere is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality and even less that takes into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose during sessions.\nThe majority of studies focused on these issues without directly considering cultural influences.\nTherapists should be weary of clients’ and their own cultural influences; careful care should be taken to ensure that the client understands the therapists’ confidentiality terms and conditions when confidentiality terms or a secret may not be maintained.\nIt is recommended that family therapists take into account the context of culture prior therapeutic decisions.\nCulture plays a large role in an individual’s decision-making process in terms of when it is appropriate to breech confidentiality as well as how the breech is perceived.\nValues may not always be considered ethical, which may create the possibility that a clinician’s personal values do not protect the welfare of his or her clients.\nA lack of understanding around the limits of confidentiality would limit the amount of information disclosed in sessions.\nExamined psychologists knowledge of legal and ethical guidelines and found almost 75% of participants were misinformed about their state laws, despite reporting a belief they were well aware of state statutes and ethical guidelines.\nTherapists’ understanding of the confidentiality concept as well as the implications this may have for couples and families, has been grossly understudied.\nThe influence of culture on the therapy process is an important area of inquiry which has implications for the therapeutic alliance, the type of information disclosed, and treatment effectiveness and outcome. Therapists from different cultures viewed confidentiality policies differently, and 2) clients from different cultural backgrounds reported significant differences in their understanding and comfort level with their rights to confidentiality and its limits. May support the notion that there is passive discrimination occurring in that individuals from non-Western cultures have different perceptions and understanding of the confidentiality process, which may influence their willingness to disclose, and thus, impact the outcome of treatment.\nTherapists should be more proactive in assessing clients’ understanding of the confidentiality process.\nThis lack of clear guidance has resulted in more and more providers deciding to not consult professionals in ethics or the law to resolve their ethical dilemmas; rather they are consulting supervisors and colleague.\nNeither the AAMFT code of ethics or New York State Mental Hygiene Law offers guidance regarding how non-Western therapists should proceed if their cultural values or worldview is inconsistent with our Western confidentiality policy.\nReluctance among non-Western clinicians to breech confidentiality under any circumstance\n“In practice, the decision to break confidentiality is multi-factored and complex, likely influenced by a combination of the psychologist’s own values, the items and factors discussed in the present study, and additional considerations that have yet to be discovered\"\nConfidentiality may not be a one-size-fits-all concept. Results indicate that clients from non-Western cultures did not completely understand the concept of privileged communication or the limits to confidentiality.\nConfidentiality policies were limited and argued for their reexamination as they relate to therapy.\nFor some clients, the concept of confidentiality was inconsistent with their beliefs, thus creating a disconnect between one of the benchmarks of therapy (i.e., confidentiality) and an individual or family’s culture of origin.\nNon-Western therapists expressed reluctance to breech confidentiality under an circumstance\nConfidentiality guidelines should be tailored to the particular context and individuals involved in treatment.\nFuture research may wish to examine the decision- making process as it relates to confidentiality of non-Western therapists more closely with more diverse and larger samples.\nIt is not the intent of clinicians to conduct ineffective treatment or behave unethically; however, there does seem to be a failure to recognize the role of personal values and culture.\nMore specific information is needed directly from non-Western clients regarding how to modify the confidentiality process in a way that is respectful, yet still provides the safeguards intended\nIt is imperative that clinicians find a culturally-respective way to make clients feel safe to reveal what may be embarrassing or personally sensitive information in treatment\nMore precise comparative study is needed among cultures to better understand the influence of different beliefs.\nEthical therapist behavior clearly requires more than good intentions, and the values permeating therapeutic efforts must…be more than a matter of personal bias and subjectivity\nWill inform a decision-making manual which can be easily disseminated to educators and treatment providers.

Clinical Competencies: Working with Individuals At-Risk for Suicide: Attitudes and Approach: No treatment will be successful without the establishment of a good therapeutic alliance with the client. At-risk for suicide clients are often interpersonally dysfunctional and/or have significant pathology that makes difficult creating a strong working relationship. Patients who went on to commit suicide within two years of being hospitalized, compared to others still alive, were those most often described at their intake session as guarded, hostile, difficult to interview. Approaches and Attitudes in Creating Therapeutic Alliance: Being aware of how at-risk patients affect us, and effectively managing our reactions. It is up to the therapist to maintain a collaborative, non-adversarial stance in creating a safe harbor for these clients to share information essential for understanding their level of risk, and to develop a treatment plan that will reduce that risk. This work requires an active role for the therapist truly invested in understanding the client. It requires the therapist to be available, accessible, and willing to foster a dependency to strengthen the initial attachment. To effectively move ahead, the therapist and client need to develop a shared perspective and work as a team toward decreased risk. Understanding Suicide: The therapist needs to be able to accurately characterize suicidal and self-destructive behaviors to reasonably understand concepts of intent and lethality. Intent refers to the aims, purposes, or goals of the behavior - death (ending all further experience of pain by never more being conscious), a wish for rebirth, or to join a loved one in heaven, are commonly expressed statements that describe suicidal intent.

Introduction","icon":"","description":"\nIn many contexts, the term 'couple' has replaced 'marriage' because of its emphasis on the bond between family members/individuals. This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage). Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)\nWith respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).\nWhile the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible).

Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son. Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. Family members have a long history and a future together. Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).\nWe need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems. Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts) For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

The goal of therapy shifted from interrupting problematic patterns of interaction to helping clients find new perspective on their lives. When they said reality was constructed, they meant socially constructed. Interpretations are shaped by our context. Interpretation of our experience mediates behavior. Social constructionists place more emphasis on the intersubjective influence of language and culture. Therapy becomes a process of deconstruction, freeing clients from the tyranny of entrenched beliefs. Inherent in most forms of therapy is the idea that before you can solve a problem, you must figure out what is wrong. But solution-focused turns this assumption on its head. The best way to solve problems is to discover what people do when they are not having the problem. Exceptions to a complaint. Therapists create a shift in their clients' experience by helping them reexamine how they look at things. <br><a data-href=\"Externalization\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/externalization.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Externalization</a>: Redefining problems not as properties of the individuals who suffer them, but as alien oppressors. The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. Structure became the target of change. Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems. Then, therapists aimed their interventions at those underlying beliefs. More recently, it dawned on therapists that those belief systems do not arise in a vacuum Behavior is shaped by transactions we don't always see.

Listen to the description of the problem and identify all members of the family, household, and others who might be involved. Establish connection and engagement. Ask how the problem is affecting other members of the family. You'd like to hear from everyone, at least initially, in order to get as much information as possible. Reminder calls help increase likelihood of attendance. Build alliance with the family. Develop hypothesis about what is maintaining the presenting problem.\nEstablish rapport.\nGather information.\nIntroduce yourself.\nOrient the family to the therapy room (physical or virtual) and the format of sessions.

Take a family history. Conduct the genogram to diagram the family network. Listen for family life cycle transitions. Search for strengths and resilience. Remain curious and respectful. Explore the process of family interaction by asking questions about how family members relate to one another and inviting them to discuss their problems with one another in session. What is keeping the family stuck?\nShare recommendations for treatment. What is maintaining the problem?\nMaintain therapeutic alliance. Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?\nChallenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. Listen to people's feelings. Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. Step back and observe. When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. Stay calm: You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. Be curious. Display empathy and respect. Review the therapeutic relationship. Say goodbye. Reinforce progress. Review what the family has accomplished. Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges.

Assess for substance use, IPV, and affairs. Consider assessment tools if needed.\nBe aware of mandated reporting. General Practitioner What is your scope of practice? Specialist Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems? Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. All behavior makes sense in context. No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. Family therapists work to see the big picture. Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. Share the following assumptions: A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. Systems theory Systems metaphor\nA family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. Social constructionist Textual metaphor\nPeople narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. Skeptical of objective reality.\nReality is constructed. Reality is constructed through language. Reality is negotiated through relationships. Shared meanings coordinate social action. Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. Therapist assumes expert role. Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. Humans are essentially good. All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).\nA supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. <br>Examples such as <a data-href=\"Carl Whitaker\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href=\"Virginia Satir\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Virginia Satir</a> One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication. An individual's behavior and symptoms always make sense in context. <br>All behaviors and symptoms serve a purpose within the system, allowing the system to maintain <a data-href=\"Homeostasis\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Homeostasis</a>.\nNo one individual controls behavior in a system and therefore no one individual can be blamed for problems in the family. Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).\nIf the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people. Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. People are always communicating. All behavior is communicative. One cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions Report = Content = information = (What is said)\nCommand = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life\nBSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.\nOften see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions Go slow\nEngage in behavior they want to eliminate What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. <br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. <br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a> loop. They make common-sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention.

Centerpiece of the model\nFamilies encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it.

This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. What often needs to happen?

Structural: Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies. Functional: Problems result when people try to protect or control one another covertly, so that their symptoms serve a function for the system. Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. The job is simply to get the family moving again.\nHelp families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. In pushing family members to set concrete goals, they are forced to clarify vague dissatisfactions. The primary goal is behavior change. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. <br><a data-href=\"Mental Research Institute (MRI)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. <br><a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a>: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around) Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. Define a resolvable complaint. Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. Who sees it as a problem?\nWhy is it a problem now? \"What is the problem that brings you here today?\" is too vague. Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. The solution is part of the problem.\nPrescribe some alternative behavior!\nThe key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. MRI Approach: Introduction to the treatment setup\nInquiry and definition of the problem\nEstimation of the behavior maintaining the problem\nSetting goals for treatment\nSelecting and making behavioral interventions\nTermination Attempted solutions: The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories: When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT\nWhen clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING\nWhen clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. Paradoxical interventions: The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s). Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. Restraining technique: Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different. Co-founded the Family Therapy Institute of Washington D.C.

Emphasize the use of directives.\nIf therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. Interaction Stage: Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem\nEncourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another? Goal Setting Stage Providing directives\nGive the family a task, directives Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. \"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation.\" For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions: \"Who makes you depressed?\"\n\"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?\" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. Example: A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent. Mandanes talked about how one relationship may metaphorically replicate another and power struggles in couples (money, education, control of children, etc.) Negotiation (pg. 90)\n<br><a data-href=\"Quid Pro Quo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/quid-pro-quo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quid Pro Quo</a> (pg. 91)\nPretend techniques (pg. 91)\nOrdeals (pg. 91) Hayley believed that telling people what they're doing wrong only mobilizes resistance. Changes in behavior alter perceptions. Milan group was interested in getting families to see things differently through (reframe) positive connotation. Which then gets family members to behave differently. Shift from behavior to cognition set stage for constructivist/narrative movements. Families should have clear generational boundaries. Therapists should be 'neutral' and not have expectations for families. Therapy helps the family by simply examining the family, asking questions to help them examine their own family structure, and exposing games after which they can redesign their family into a better structure on their own. <br><a data-href=\"Mara Selvini Palazzoli\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/mara-selvini-palazzoli.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mara Selvini Palazzoli</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Gianfranco Cecchin\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/gianfranco-cecchin.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gianfranco Cecchin</a> Presession: Generate initial hypothesis of presenting problem.

Families treated by co-therapists and observed by other members of the team. <br><a data-href=\"Positive Connotation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-connotation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Connotation</a>s Must include the entire family system and confirm the behavior of all family members as maintaining the stability and cohesion of the group. <br><a data-href=\"Rituals\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/rituals.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rituals</a>: Engage families in a series of actions that ran counter to or exaggerated rigid family rules. Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. Set minimum goals for change. Investigate solutions to the complaints. Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'\nUnderstand clients' preferred views. Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'\nNurture and solidify initial change. Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)\nTherapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)\nCo-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)\nLate in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?\nI don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. Define a resolvable complaint. Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint Who is doing what?\nIf I had a video of this, what would I see? Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?\nDetermine a minimum change goal What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem: What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?\nWhat happens after these attempted solutions? Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like: What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution? The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions: How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?\nWhat do they hold near and dear?\nWhen are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?\nWhat is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?\nWhose idea was it to come? Why now?\nWho is most optimistic that therapy will help? How will you know the situation is improving?\nWhat kinds of change will you settle for?\nWhat will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?\nWhat will each of you settle for? Therapeutic restraint: Telling clients to 'go slow'\nCautioning them about the dangers of improvement\nGiving insturctions about how to make the problem worse Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. Identify problem-solution feedback loops: Demand-Refuse\nDiscuss-Acoid\nCriticize-Defend\nAccuse-Deny Encourage the family to do less of the same: When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. <br><a data-href=\"Reframing\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reframing</a>: For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. Acknowledging (Reinforcing): When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. Predicting or Prescribing: Exploring the dangers of movement. Therapeutic restraint / going slow\nPrescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting\nJamming / experiment\nReframing\nLess of the same\nAcknowledge / reinforce Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on: Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing.

The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. <br>The three major concepts of structural family therapy are <a data-href=\"Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Structure</a>, <a data-href=\"Boundaries\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundaries</a>, and <a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a>s. <br><a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a> (Couple; Parent; Sibling) Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. Structure is: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).\nThe focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers'\nOrganization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple\nParental\nChild/Sibling Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.\nDisengaged systems are independent, but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support. Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.\nEnmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness can cripple initiative. Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. \"The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system.\"\nDisengaged or enmeshed subsystems\nHierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary\nConflict avoidance Detouring which results in a scapegoat\nCross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted) Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).\nFamilies are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of: Normative life cycle transition The arrival of a first child\nAn adult child leaving home An acute stressor Natural Disaster\nUnemployment Single Adult\nCoupling\nHaving Children\nFamilies with Young Children\nFamilies with School-Age Children\nFamilies with Adolescents\nDivorce\nBlended Families\nLaunching Children\nLater Life Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. All behavior makes sense in context. The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other. <br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> refers to those moments in therapy when family members interact directly with each other. <br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> is not necessarily a technique. It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session. Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.\nProblems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.\nActivate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. Create effective hierarchy: Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).\n<br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> s reveal structural patterns and later change them. Take-Away: Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including: Who should attend\nHow often\nReferrals for psychiatric evaluation Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)\nMap the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)\nIntervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment) Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. Some problems may be treated individually. Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals.

Assist family members in seeing how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. Briefly explore the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members might take to interact in more productive ways to create a shift in the family structure and help resolve the presenting problem. Greet the family\nAsk for each person's view of the problem\nListen carefully\nAcknowledge what you hear\nModel empathy that family members are temporarily not able to provide\nAcknowledgement (feeling heard and understood) releases family members from resentment\nJoining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. Intervention Language: Joined with the Family\nEngaged in Reflective Listening\nBuilt Rapport\nAcknowledged\nReflected\nSummarized\nValidated\nElicited\nEmphasized\nChallenged\nReinforced Maintain an outsider perspective to remain objective, while becoming familiar with family's experiential reality. Unless therapist is allowed to become part of the new system, no change will take place. Respect the family, and its individual members, despite presenting problem (i.e., abuse)\nThe therapist joins the system in the sense that they accommodate to its style; how people talk, what words they use, how they walk, and so forth. Make contact with each member of the family Greeting, shaking hands (pre-COVID)\nUsing names\nNoticing something unique about each of the members\nFind something similar about each person and then allow the family members to recognize the similarity Skills involved in joining: Accommodating: Matching the family's style of language with gestures or subject matter (being 'familiar' to the family) Being interested in the family's interests (i.e., baseball). Validating: Validate the worth of each family member. Searching for Competencies: Therapist enhances self-esteem by discovering and validating competencies. <br>During joining, assess the <a data-href=\"Family Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-structure.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Structure</a>: <br><a data-href=\"Hierarchy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hierarchy</a> Who has the most power?

Attending to process = accommodation when the therapist responds to the underlying affect in the manner in which the statement is made. Process comments are better when kept general.

When the enactment breaks down: Comment on what went wrong. Push them to keep going. Assess interactions in session. Families tend to quickly induct therapists in their culture. Take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing structure requires focusing on process, not content. Achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration.

Invite family members to speak for themselves. Block interruptions. Assist dyads in finishing conversations without intrusion. Although structural family therapy begins with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be held with individuals or subgroups to strengthen boundaries. Asking family members to change seats. Asking family members to move seats further apart or closer together or turn toward one another. Having separate sessions with individuals or subsystems to strengthen boundaries. Asking one or more members to remain silent during an interaction. Asking questions that highlight a problem boundary area (e.g., do you always answer for your son when he is asked a question?)\nBlocking interruptions or encouraging pauses to enable less dominant persons to speak. The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. While taking sides seems like a violation of neutrality, this is done to unbalance and realign the system (note that fairness is achieved because the therapist sides with family members in turn).\nTools/Techniques: <br><a data-href=\"Reframing\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reframing</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Complementarity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Complementarity</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Intensity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intensity</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> The therapist sometimes challenges the way clients see things. Act as a teacher, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Stroke and a Kick: To mother, \"You are very helpful.\" (Stroke)\nTo daughter, \"Mommy sometimes takes away your voice. Can you speak for yourself?\" (Kick) After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)\nTo formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. Should take into account every member. Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. Should not be explained to the family. As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. Use family's language. Use family's content. Include everyone. Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. Realize that there is no perfect reframe. Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. Blocking: Stopping usual transactions. Exaggerating: Encouraging or sustaining interactions. Silence: When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD) Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions) Therapist must be more flexible than the family. Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).\n<br><a data-href=\"Salvador Minuchin\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/salvador-minuchin.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Salvador Minuchin</a> encouraged new therapists to reflect on aspects of their personal and relational lives that shape their therapeutic process and client behavior in session. Describe 'who you are' as a therapist. How will 'who you are' as a therapist impact therapy with families?\nWhat are your personal strengths? What are your growth areas? Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. More recently, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Similar to all family therapy approaches, structural family therapy is not effective in all cases. No research identifies readily observable characteristics shared by failed cases of structural family therapy. Developed to work with poor urban families, at all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and across countries. Indirect empirical support, as research on efficacy has focused on applicability to family treatment. Studies that directly test structural family therapy's efficacy in the treatment of various presenting problems and targeted populations are needed. Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'\nEffectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'\nCurrently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches. Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'\nInsufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)\nEffective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models. It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works: Randomized control trials\nCase studies data\nObservations of therapists and clients Collecting qualitative or quantitative Remember: Research lags behind practice in family therapy. Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. Heteronormative\nPathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)\nFamily mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances.

Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. Behavior is maintained by its consequences.\nConsequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers. Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)\nCBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. Deficits in communication and problem solving. High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members) Behavior is maintained by its consequences. Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)\nGood relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)\nEmotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)\nUnderstand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.\nUncovering hidden/automatic assumptions that keep people stuck. Overgeneralizations\nMagnification and minimization\nPersonalization\nDichotomous thinking\nLabeling and mislabeling\nAlso called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of\nThe therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. This agenda of therapy is educational: Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Identify behavioral goals\nLearn techniques to achieve these goals\nFacilitate social reinforcement of change Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)\nUse of homework assignments\nPhase out therapy gradually. Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. Booster sessions Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems: All couples run into conflict. Conflict resolution is a critical skill. Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. Families need problem solving skills Therapy includes: Clinical interview\nRating specific behaviors\nRelationship satisfaction questionnaires Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making. Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy.

Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing approximate behaviors. Ignoring\nRewards Identifying Automatic Thoughts Assist family members in identifying automatic thoughts\nTo improve the skills of identifying automatic thoughts, clients are encouraged to keep a diary to jot down situations that provoke the thoughts and the resulting emotional reactions. Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. Do not be triangulated! CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'\nBlocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary Inclusion of other individuals if necessary\nMedication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT\nCo-therapy model is allowed\nBoth individual and conjoint sessions are allowed. Clients may be more likely to divulge information about their past in private sessions.

If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Once you know what works, do more of it. If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).\nFocus is on solutions, on what works for clients. Respect clients own resources. Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. Future-oriented\nFocusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).\nThe task of therapy is to do something different. What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen? The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'\nSolution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. What brings you in?\nWhat are your best hopes for this meeting? Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. Changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. Problem talk: Negative\nFocuses on the past\nImplies permanence of problems. Clients are experts in their own lives. Clients know what they need Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?\nThe therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. People are resourceful. Problems are normal life-cycle complications. Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. What will you be doing instead? The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems – effective solutions already in their repertoire.\nChanging the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.\nAs the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.\nIt is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.\nGetting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.\nChange perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. They begin living in the solution, not the problem. The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. Time limited\nSessions are made one at a time\nOne may be enough\nTypical course includes 3-5 sessions\nClients can return as-needed\nOften a week to a few weeks apart\nOnce you know more of what works, do more of it Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. What do you think the problem is now?\nHow will you know when the problem is solved?\nHow will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?\nWhat will have to be different about others involved in the situation?\nWhat is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back? Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). Asks more about perceptions than feelings. Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.\nConsultant\nGuardian of the conversation\nDon't get bogged down in 'problem talk'\nFocus on what is right\nDirect clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. Focus on the 'here and now'\nThe future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. Assumes a position of 'not knowing.' What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?\nWhat needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?\nOften in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?\nConstructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the client to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represented the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone. So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?\nWhat is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?\nWhat would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back?

In-Session What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?\nWhat changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment? Exceptions When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't? Solution-focused therapists intervene and interrupt 'problem talk' before it escalates into demoralizing bickering, blaming and defending, accusations, etc. Agency How did you do that? How did you get that to happen? Coping How have you managed to cope, endure, keep going? Scaling (i.e., making numbers talk) What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope? Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. How were you hoping I could help you?\nAsking for clients' perceptions\nAcknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. How do we know when to stop meeting like this?\nGoals should be: Small\nSalient to clients\nConcrete, behavioral, measurable\nAchieveable\nInvolve hard work\nStart of something\nInvolving new behaviors What will be present? What will be happening?\nAfter hearing and acknowledging the clients' description of the problem and what they've tried to do about them, next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. Specifically, how will you be doing this?\nHow will the two of you know when you solved your problems? How will things be different?\nWhat will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else? The clearer the goal, the easier to measure progress. Can you tell me more specifically what will be happening when you two are getting along better?\nWhat will you be doing differently? Modest enough to be achievable. Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened?\nInvite clients to envision positive outcomes and to activate problem-solving by giving them a mental picture of their goals. Helps clients to look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do things that the problem has been obstructing. Suppose one night there is a miracle and while you are sleeping the problem that brought you into therapy is solved. How would you know?\nWhat would be different?\nWhat will you notice the next morning that will tell you there has been a miracle?\nWhat will your [family member] notice? Helping families see that their problems have exceptions - times when they don't occur. Exceptions are solutions that families already have in their repertoire. Probing for exceptions (e.g., times when the family didn't have the problem) invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. Finding exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail; also since these exceptions just happened, it is more plausible they could happen again. When in the recent past might the problem have happened but didn't (or was less intense or more manageable)?\nWhat's different about those times when the problem doesn't happen?\nHow have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you? How did you manage that?\nWhat keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?\nHow come things aren't worse?\nPunctuate with enthusiasm and support\nWork to keep solution talk in the forefront. Listen carefully for an exception to the problem, then punctuate that exception by getting more details about it and congratualating the family on it. Connect the exception to the family's goals by asking how the goal would be reached if this exception were to occur more often. The therapist asks: On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now? \"It is a 2.\"\n\"So, you feel a little better than when you called. How did you achieve this improvement?\"\n\"What do you think you need to do to achieve a 3?\" Used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you will be able to avoid losing your temper this week?\nWhat do you have to do to stick to your guns this time? Wow! How did you do that?\nTo be effective, compliments should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work Team approach with therapist in session and colleagues behind the mirror. Therapist usually takes a 10 minute break near the end of the session to compose a summary message to the clients. The summary messages begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the client's goals, and presession progress and strengths. What I heard you tell me today is that... Did I hear all of you correctly? A statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy. \"I'm not surprised you are so depressed.\" A reflection of the emotional impact on the client. \"My sense is that you must really be hurting.\" Compliments on pre-session changes or strengths \"I was impressed by how many things you've tried to make things better.\" Some content on the client's goals\nSuggestions for building on positives Formula first-session task\nDo more of what works\nDo something different\nGo slow\nDo the opposite\nThe prediction task Devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress\nInquire about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the clients' role in attaining it. What's better?\nWhat happened that you liked?\nTell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that. Wow. That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?\nAnd what else is better? What do you think the next step might be?\nHow did you keep things from getting worse?\nWhat's your idea about what might be helpful? Sometimes the model is portrayed as an approach that does not permit discussion of the problem, but this is not accurate. When done skillfully, families do not feel rushed. Emotion is not avoided, but it is also not sought or elicited. Therapist is present as a real, genuinely concerned person, but does not engage in unneeded personal self-disclosure. How can we know when to stop meeting like this?\nWhat needs to be different in your life as a result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?\nIf you wait till all of the family's problems are solved, you will never stop seeing them.

Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave. Experience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. Problems affect people\nProblems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. Hence, letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams The truth of experience is not discovered, it is created!\nNarrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narrative of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new futures. People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-storied aspects of their lives and relationships. Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. Holds a position of curiosity\nCherishes each person/family's unique stories. Invites clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives. Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. Therapist influential, but decentered\nPerson separate from problem\nAll problems have exceptions\nOpposite of problem is preferred\nPreferred story woven into identity\nImpact of relationships explored\nDeconstruct societal norms\nPersonal decision-making supported Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. The problem is the problem.\nAren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family.\n<br><a data-href=\"Social Constructionism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Constructionism</a> There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (re-examining) established truths that oppress people's lives. People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems)\nPeople are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. People are not their problems. People can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. Reject categorizing people\nIn the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves with clients. They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis)\nWant to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relations. When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relationship to it. Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict.\nTherapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Problems may be regarded as alien invaders. Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)\nOpen space for new and more constructive views of themselves.\nSeparate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy. Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href=\"Deconstruction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions. <br><a data-href=\"Reconstruction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience. Effects Questions (elicit effects of the problem) How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationships?\nClients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots. Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multi-stories lives. Once people notice how their stories are problem-saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?\nThen, the therapists asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?\nMeetings are typically 60 minutes.\nLength of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between). CAUTION: Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories. Instead: Narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories. Counterstory Asking Permission is central to the model. At the start of 1 st meeting, the therapist asks if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy. Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from previous session aloud and asking a question, such as: \"Can you tell me about any new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time?\" Other times the therapist begins wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations. Therapist use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session. Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem. Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keep a story alive and growing. Collaborative\nCarefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem. Takes notes of what works and what doesn't. Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation.\nTherapy is a relationship - a conversation!\nAsk questions to expose gaps in problematic stories. Open space for describing alternatives. Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently. Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments. The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders. Therapists have more questions than answers! It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. How long have you been noticing this [problem]?\nWhat effect does the [problem] have on your life?\nHow does the [problem] impact your relationship?\nDoes [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?\nWhat do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?\nAre you accepting what [problem] is doing?\nAre these effects acceptable to you or not?\nWhy is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?\nHow would you prefer things to be? People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.\nThe therapist invites family members to: Evaluate their current situation\nName the problems involved\nEvaluate their relationship to those problems\nTake a stand in regard to them\nTell more satisfying stories of their lives\nEvaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. Private hopes and fears\nFamily interactions\nContributions of culture of origin\nTraditions, legacies Questioning Is that the problem speaking?\nWhose values are guiding you in saying that? By exposing discourses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. What name would you give the problem?\nWhat is it like to experience the problem?\nWhat effect does the problem have on your life?\nWhat effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?\nWhat has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?\nWhat effects does the problem have on your other relationships?\nHow does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?\nIs this what you want for your life? Why or why not?\nAre we talking about what you want to be talking about?\nIs this conversation useful?

Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve. Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice\nMore qualitative research rather than quantitative studies\nLittle empirical support currently exists\nRandomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist Listen to stories as stories\nBe attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story\nAsk about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationships\nMake sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem'\nUnless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences\nAt some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories\nTry to put yourself in their shoes\nDo not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them\nListen and ask\nListen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust Listen 'deconstructively' to family's stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings\nAs families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning\nWe wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?\nAnd, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'? Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society\nDevelop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work in the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult\nThere are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play\nDeconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that support them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem\nExternalizing - problems are seen as separate from people\nAs we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families\nIf we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?\nWhat 'starves' the problem?\nWho benefits from the problem?\nIn what settings might the problem be useful?\nWho advocates for the problem?\nWhat groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?\nWhat are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it\nAs we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem\nWhat are the family's preferred directions?\nCounterplot / counter-story\n'Standing against' the problem Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?\nIs the problem always with you?

Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness\nWhat stood out for them?\nWhat images it brought forward?\nHow it resonated with their own experiences?\nWhere they were transported by the interview?\nSituate their reflections in their own experience\nComment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive\nWe take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop\nWe often refer back to these notes and read them aloud\nWe may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems\nWe sometimes write letters between therapy sessions\nIn these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session\nOut intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session\nWe may invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict... Narrative therapy aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. <br>Reality is socially constructed. (<a data-href=\"Social Constructionism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Constructionism</a>)\nReality is influenced by and communicated through language. Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality. There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. Telling One's Story A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. Externalization Technique Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. Deconstruction Technique This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. Unique Outcomes Technique To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that does not include your most pervasive problems. Existentialism The belief that the world holds no inherent meaning, and that we all must make our own meaning in life. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dulwichcentre.com.au/\"

The efficacy of IBCT has been supported in three clinical trials, including one with five year follow-up. Additionally, the effectiveness of IBCT in the real world has been supported through a system-wide dissemination effort in the United States Department of Veteran’s Affairs. The reach of IBCT has also been extended through an online program, www. OurRelationship.com, based on IBCT. A nationwide clinical trial with a representative sample of the US population demonstrated the effectiveness of this program on both relationship and individual variables.\nPurpose: Describe the IBCT conceptualization of couple distress and of couple intervention Review the empirical evidence in support of IBCT\nDiscuss recent innovations in treatment delivery. (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111) “Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) is based in part on traditional behavioral couple therapy but expands both the conceptualization of couple distress and of intervention.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)“Developed in the 1990s, Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) was based in part on Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT).” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)“IBCT extended the conceptualization of couple distress beyond TBCT’s notions of positive to negative exchange ratios and extended the conceptualization of intervention beyond TBCT’s focus on positive behavior change through communication and problem-solving skills.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)\n(a) the stuff of relationships is the interaction between partners (b) there are three broad factors that influence that interaction: the characteristics each partner brings to the interaction and the context in which that interaction occurs.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)\n“IBCT conceptualizes these ideas through a simple mnemonic: the DEEP analysis or DEEP understanding of relationship problems. DEEP: D: Differences between partners in personality, interests, goals, among others. E: Emotional sensitivities or vulnerabilities that each partner brings to the relationship that may make the differences particularly problematic. E: External circumstances, particularly stressful circumstances, which may exacerbate the problems created by differences and emotional sensitivities. P: Pattern of Interaction that couples get into as they try to navigate the problem created by the DEE. “The IBCT theory of intervention is based on the fundamental notion that all relationship problems result from the combination of a triggering action or inaction and a sensitive reaction.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)\n“Relationship problems can be resolved by altering the triggering action and/or by altering the vulnerable response. In contrast to TBCT, which focuses on making change in the triggering action or inaction, IBCT provides equal or greater emphasis on changing the vulnerable response (i.e., emotional acceptance), given that most troublesome actions or inactions in relationships are not egregious acts such as violence or verbal abuse. A second key part of the IBCT theory on intervention is that altering both the triggering events and altering the emotional reactions are best achieved through ‘contingency shaped processes’ rather than ‘rule governed’ processes” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111-112)\n“rule governed change is deliberate change as a result of specific instruction or training by the therapist.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“TBCT encourages couples to engage in more positive behavior with each other and teaches them communication and problem solving strategies. In contrast, contingency shaped change comes about spontaneously as a result of a change in the context and the resultant emotional and cognitive reactions.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112) “Although IBCT employs both strategies, it relies more heavily on the later and assumes it will lead to more lasting change.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112) “IBCT produced comparable or superior outcomes to TBCT in a study of 21 couples.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112) “This clinical trial showed that IBCT and TBCT produced similar gains in relationship satisfaction by the end of treatment, but couples in IBCT evidenced significantly greater maintenance of gains than their TBCT counterparts during the first two years of follow-up.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“These differences between the conditions disappeared over the last three years of follow-up.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“TBCT couples made greater gains by treatment termination but IBCT couples showed greater maintenance of their gains at the two year follow-up assessment” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“The efficacy research demonstrated that IBCT is comparable or superior to TBCT, particularly in the maintenance of treatment gains.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112) “couples with low-level violence could benefit from treatment without a danger for violence escalating” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“couples experiencing infidelity could benefit from treatment in the short term and, although these couples are at greater risk for separation over the long-term, those who stay together benefit as much as non-infidelity couples” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“for couples with children, treatment showed benefits for parenting” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“Higher relationship commitment and longer length of marriage were independently predictive of long-term positive outcome” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“Examination of mediators of change indicated that changes in frequency of targeted behavior, as well as acceptance of target behavior, were linked with positive outcome, with frequency more strongly linked early in therapy but acceptance more strongly linked later in therapy with outcome. As expected, TBCT generated greater changes in frequency of behavior while IBCT generated greater changes in acceptance of behavior” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“Social workers and psychologists, are trained in IBCT through an intensive 6-month training program that includes: (a) a several day workshop\n(b) weekly phone supervision while trainees are seeing couples\n(c) observation of at least 20 audio-recorded sessions of these trainees by IBCT consultants\n(d) competence criteria based on ratings of these recorded sessions by IBCT consultants. Approximately 80% of trainees complete the training successfully” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)\n“Preliminary evaluation of the outcome of couples treated during this training reveals that: (a) partners in these couples have far more diagnosed psychopathology than partners in the efficacy trials\n(b) couples complete an average of about 10 sessions, which is fewer than the average completed in the efficacy trials\n(c) couples evidence significant improvement even when they have as few as 4 sessions\n(d) the more sessions couples have, the greater the improvement\n(e) effect sizes are in the low to moderate range and less than those found in the efficacy trial” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112) “OurRelationship program an eight hour self-help program in which couples complete online activities consisting of text, audio, still graphics, animations, and videos.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112) Observe Phase: Partners complete assessments of their relationship and jointly decide on one or two core issues/problems to focus on during the program. Understand Phase: Leads each partner through a DEEP analysis of the problem, including how differences between partners, hidden emotions, external stressors, and patterns of communication might affect their core issue(s). These separate analyses are shared during the subsequent ‘Understand’ conversation. Respond Phase: During the ‘Respond’ phase, partners develop a plan for ameliorating the problem by viewing information about acceptance and self-change, communication tips, and suggestions tailored to their presenting problem. During the ‘Respond’ conversation, couples share their strategies to improve their patterns of communication and engage in problem-solving exercises specific to their core issue(s). (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113) “the OurRelationship program was well-received, with 86% of couples completing the program and 97% of participants indicating they would recommend it to a friend.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113)\n“OurRelationship program created significant improvements in relationship satisfaction, as well as significant effects on depressive, and anxiety symptoms.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113) “Web-based resources — with their greater flexibility, reduced stigma, and lower costs — can reach many couples who would otherwise be unable or unwilling to seek in-person couple therapy.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113)\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Integrative behavioral couple therapy","level":1,"id":"Integrative_behavioral_couple_therapy_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Theoretical Notions in IBCT","level":2,"id":"Theoretical_Notions_in_IBCT_0"},{"heading":"Evidence in Support of IBCT","level":2,"id":"Evidence_in_Support_of_IBCT_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/3.-behavioral-family-therapy/@christensenintegrativebehavioralcouple2017.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706732947950,"modifiedTime":1724752004849,"sourceSize":10024,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/3.

This study examined changes in couples' communication over the course of IBCT and TBCT. Early, middle, and late sessions were coded to measure couples' communication of acceptance. Results showed that IBCT couples expressed more nonblaming descriptions of problems and more soft emotions than TBCT couples during late stages of therapy. IBCT couples significantly increased their nonblaming description of problems and significantly decreased their expressions of hard emotions and their problematic communication over time. Results support the hypothesis that structural differences between the therapies affect initial levels of emotional expression in session. Increases in nonblaming descriptions of problems were significantly correlated with increases in marital satisfaction.\n<br>Keywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Research\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Research\">#Research</a> Purpose: The purpose of the current pilot study was to investigate whether these two different approaches to couple therapy lead to theoretically predictable differences in couples’ in-session communication processes. <br>\n“Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) attempts to improve Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy by incorporating an emphasis on promoting acceptance into TBCT emphasis on behavioral change.” <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3WS2YBT6?page=1&amp;annotation=BGBEGSMX\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/zotero:/open-pdf/library/items/3WS2YBT6?page=1&amp;annotation=BGBEGSMX\" target=\"_self\">(Cordova et al., 1998, p. 1)</a> <br>\n“IBCT couples expressed more nonblaming descriptions of problems and more soft emotions than TBCT couples during late stages of therapy.

Marital therapy is viewed as inherently political. Marital therapists continuously adopt political postures without knowing it; the inadvertent consequences of this insensitivity to the political context of their work are to reinforce traditional values, many of which are oppressive to women. These political postures include an emphasis on treating dyads rather than individuals, an emphasis on behavior change, and a neglect of sex role issues. Clinical innovations are suggested: paying greater attention to whether individual well-being is promoted during the course of marital therapy; shifting toward the exploration of cognitive and perceptual processes; and expanding the emphasis of BMT on process and function to include content.\nKeywords: In Progress\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Beyond empiricism: The politics of marital therapy","level":1,"id":"Beyond_empiricism_The_politics_of_marital_therapy_0"},{"heading":"Abstract","level":2,"id":"Abstract_0"},{"heading":"Tags and Collections","level":2,"id":"Tags_and_Collections_0"},{"heading":"Extracted Annotations","level":2,"id":"Extracted_Annotations_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/3.-behavioral-family-therapy/@jacobsonempiricismpoliticsmarital1983.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1708741805749,"modifiedTime":1724752004874,"sourceSize":1579,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/3.

Symptoms: Although they are reluctant to do so, Behavioral Therapists have delineated what distinguishes a 'healthy family' and a 'dysfunctional family' (pg. 69-74 and 97-104 in FT Handbook chapters) Mutually shared goals and expectations. Support for the stresses associated with the expected transitional life stages, and other stressful life events.

The goal of the assessment is to get a baseline of the behavior so that you can quantify change. Functional Analysis of Behavior: Once the problem behavior is identified, then the antecedents and consequences surrounding the behavior are explored. (stimuli, organismic variables, target behavior/response, consequences, contingencies).\nReport the assessment to the family. Intervene in the pattern. Step 1: Induction (teach the lingo)\nStep 2: Demonstration (show them how it works)\nStep 3: Implementation (contingency contracts, time-out, star charts, marble game, etc.) Generalization: The goal is that this training will be generalized to other behaviors, but booster sessions are also helpful. Alexander and Parsons (1982) created for troubled adolescents and their families. Incorporates cognitive aspects and takes a more systemic approach, while the goal is behavioral change. Integrates three perspectives: Ecological\nLearning Theory\nCognitive\nTwo Phases of Treatment Therapy: Designed to modify attitudes, assumptions, expectations, labels and emotions of the family. The major focus is to relabel (reframe) the problem behavior into something positive. Education: Help family behave differently in conjunction with reattributions. Resistance to treatment is considered an impediment to change. It is a natural consequence of the inappropriate application of technology and failure of the clinician to understand the meaning of the behavior. Functional Family Therapy relabels behaviors to reduce resistance and to motivate change by providing reattributions for the causes of family members' behaviors. Change in meaning is a necessary precursor to behavior change. The relabeling (reframe, positive connotation, etc.) operates at three levels: Interactional Level: Benign description of the interpersonal impact of the behavior (distance regulation) Motivational Level: Recasts the motive for the behavior in a benign light. Systemic Level: Emphasizes the similarities between people, a family theme. If the reframe works it interrupts automatic processing, interrupts the behaviors that follow from this processing, and thus, changes the contingencies around the problem behavior. Functional Family Therapy emphasizes paying attention to the interpersonal functions of behaviors: Functions: A person's pattern of behaviors, feelings, and thoughts mediate amounts of psychological relatedness in a relationship with another person (distance regulation)\nThe expression of the function can be labeled good, bad, or neutral, the function itself is not judged. These functions are properties of relationships not traits. Linear Thinking: Cognitive processes need to be incorporated, although some would argue that they were never eliminated in the first place (i.e. cognition is a behavior). Meanings of behaviors, attribution processes, belief sets, automatic thinking can get in the way of contingency change. Unit of analysis tends to be the dyad: Behavior therapists have moved toward more contextual assessments, but each move out focuses on the one to one relationship rather than the system as a whole. Dependency on the therapist? Therapist teaches the model. Based on postivism Not postmodern, it is modern. Politics of behavioral couple therapy, acceptance. <br>Same process as parent training. Assessment is always first. <a data-href=\"Social Exchange Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Exchange Theory</a> viewpoint. Could include couple discussing an issue in the room, with therapist observing communication patterns. Also includes evaluating the relationship itself (pg. 106-107). Strengths\nMajor complaints\nSex life (affection)\nFuture goals\nAlternatives to the relationship\nIndividual functioning of each spouse Intervention: Once assessment is complete you set goals with the clients, focusing on one problem (well defined) at a time, this comes in the form of a contract. Major Goals: Increase positive control while decreasing aversive control. Improve communication, which should facilitate future problem solving. Interventions: Active listening with behavioral descriptions of the problem\nTeach new behavior exchanges\nEncourage couple to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and decision making. Teach strategies for future problem solving Techniques: Caring Days Make a list of what your partner could do to make you feel cared for. The partner does not need to do anything in return. Do not include sex as it can be seen as coercion. Quid Pro Quo Contracts Not very common because we get into the standstill of 'they have to do it first' Good Faith Contracts Both partners engage in those behaviors whether their partner does or does not. Politics and Power Politics of Behavioral Couple Therapy (i.e. Jacobson) Jacobson saw the issue with classic BMT as a problem with power, who gets to say what needs to change?\nIBCT was developed from these concerns, the focus shifted to acceptance and forgiveness. IBCT Deep Analysis: D Key differences between partners in personality, interests, goals, etc. E Emotional sensitivities or vulnerabilities that each partner brings to the relationship (create a vicious cycle) E External circumstances (i.e., stressful circumstances which could exacerbate the problems created by differences and vulnerabilities) P Patterns of interaction that couples get into as they try to navigate what comes from DEE above. Intervention based on the idea that all relationship problems result from the combination of a triggering action or inaction and a sensitive reaction. They suggest that relationship problems can be resolved by altering the triggering action and the vulnerable response (emotional acceptance).\nEmpirical support for the model in both clinical trials and efficacy research.

In this sense mental processes are brought about by a total system, or series of interconnections between external relationships.

This is important for systemic family therapists, since an individual’s sense of self is maintained by ongoing relationships with other members of the family which are non-linear.” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 2)“This conceptualization is enshrined in circularity in relationships and” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 2)“the interviewing technique known as ‘circular questioning” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“Milan school emphasized an attitude of neutrality” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“being necessary in order to really engage with and understand the system and that this might be considered as similar to Freud’s idea of evenly suspended attention” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“a psychoanalytic approach emphasizes that whatever the pressures of the external circumstances, the way in which these are engaged with is also significantly influenced by how individual family members function internally (e.g. splitting or integrating).” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“the family’s tendency to organize itself around the intolerance of pain and adversity, and on the other, to organize itself around the enjoyment and promotion of hope and well-being, whatever the external circumstances” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“certain modes of thinking and learning can become dominant within families.” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“These patterns are based on identificatory processes (introjective, projective, adhesive) operating within an internal (psychic) reality.\nConsequently, the understanding of family life and emotional nurturance may be seen as broadly organized under three general learning types: (1) those which learn from experience, (2) those relying on more narcissistic mechanisms, and (3) those functioning at a parasitic level. As a consequence of these fundamental differences between kinds of learning, the growth of the personality is either facilitated or opposed, thereby blocking development.” (Brodie and Wright, 2002, p. 3)“what we observe within the therapeutic encounter is that transference and countertransference are hereand-now processes which actively use the therapist as an object in which to put these unwanted states of mind.

Difficulties that lead to consultations with a family therapist often arise out of conflict within the family's own relationships.\"\n\"The family script can provide routines for family life which can be followed almost automatically.\"\n\"Repetition becomes the background against which change is the foreground, that which is new becomes the focus of attention. In contrast, chaos obscures potentially significant change, unless the new behavior facilitates consistency, in which case that new patter becomes the foreground, thus becoming the new center of attention.\"\n\"Rewriting family scripts follows the sequence of a scripted pattern giving way to some improvisation followed by the establishment of a new pattern.\"\n\"Family scripts can be defined as the family's shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.\" The term 'expectations' implies anticipation of what is to be said and done within family relationships, as well as family pressures to perform the roles as expected. If one member fails to perform in the prescribed way, another member of the family may be recruited to take up that role instead. The plot is 'scripted' while the cast can change. Family scripts are revealed when repeating patterns of family interaction are either observed or described.\nFamily Scenario: An encounter of which it can be said that something significant happens within family relationships. Basic elements of family scenario: Context Families engaging with each other around a particular task or situation Plot Family members 'motives' become clear as the scenario unfolds Outcome The consequences of the encounter are revealed The expected scenarios for each particular family situation thread together to create an overall script for how all family relationships are expected to be conducted in general. \"Problem Scenarios\": Instead called 'Attempted Solution Scenarios' This helps us to focus attention on how each person tries to solve the problem. The behavior that is experienced now as problematic may have started out as an attempted solution to an earlier problem. The co-constructed story may then become part of the family beliefs about what to expect of itself. Improvising implies abandoning the set script and extemporizing instead. This may happen when the old script does not fit the current situation, or when those involved are in sear of something different.\nThe therapist can help to create a new co-constructed scenario by suggesting a goal which the family then achieves in their own way. Suggest a scenario in which it becomes necessary for the family to improvise. (in two parent families, the parents should devise a strategy together)\nTry to block each move that has not worked in the past. Unraveling some of the origins of the scripted scenarios frees families to explore new pathways. Work on the present and the past can reinforce each other. Replicated Scripts Parents with their own individual scenarios from childhood that are repeated Corrective Scripts Choice of the opposite style of parenting Improvised scripts Corrective scripts repeated over time The therapist's background also plays a part in shaping scenarios in therapy. Positive Labeling Can be given to replicative scrips by labeling them as being loyal to the family of origin. Corrective scripts can be given a positive frame by pointing out to parents that they are struggling to provide a better experience for their children than their parents were able to provide for them. Improvised scripts (unlike the historical replicative and corrective scripts) are written in response to current situations. They are improvised either out of necessity or driven by curiosity and a wish to explore new ways of relating. A stimulus for improvisation is a degree of uncertainty about what to do next so that interaction must be played off the cuff. Positive comments can be made about how much the family is exploring unknown territory. Attachment behavior The behavior of a person seeking proximity to his or her attachment figure in a potentially dangerous situation. (This is a mechanism that protects children - or adults - when vulnerable)\nThe child uses the parent as a safe base from which to explore, and parent and child stay in contact to ensure that they can get together in the presence of any potential danger. In terms of script theory a potentially threatening situation evokes tightly scripted behavior in which parent and child predictably got together. Exploration allows for more improvisation. The therapist can become a temporary attachment figure to the family. The therapist must be aware of the factors that threaten the family's relationship. Any new behavior of uncertain origin emerging in a relationship (e.g., unexplained impatience) might be seen as either strange and treated as potentially dangerous, or novel and will arouse curiosity. If it is perceived as strange, attempts may be made to avoid reprovoking the impatience, returning to old familiar ways instead. If the impatience arouses curiosity, then it will probably lead to trying to discover what it is all about, and to improvise ways of dealing with it. If it becomes clear that the impatience poses a problem and something has to be done about it, new solutions may be improvised out of the necessity to sort things out. There are two main forms of improvisation in family relationships: Improvisation that comes out of necessity (Something has to be done when old solutions are not working)\nImprovisation out of curiosity when it feels safe to try something new, even if it is uncertain where it will lead. A therapist who is trusted by the family can make the risks involved in improvisation feel less frightening, even when family relationships are insecure.

Psychoanalytic Models of Family Therapy","icon":"","description":"\nMost psychoanalytic models are based on Freud's idea around the identity, ego and super ego, or the development of self. For Freud the drives were sexual (in terms of possession and control), for newer psychoanalytic ideas the drives are more around connection and validation of the self (good or bad).\nObject Relations Theory in some ways provides a bridge between psychodynamic theory and systems theory. We relate to people in the present based on expectations formed by early experience. Normal Development (?) Early development is based on attachment theory/separation-individuation constructs. Infant is born ready to be in a reciprocal relationship. This is activated by relating to a parent, by being loved and loving. Stages of development based on object relations: internal object (mental image of self and other, and self in relation to other). Objectless (primary narcissism/autistic) there is no other, only self. The following stages focus on the development of self through relations with internal and external objects: first the actual interactions and then the unconscious residue of the interactions. As humans, we exist in the context of relationships not as single units: There is no self without an object, there is no object without a self. Infants develop in a context of concentric 'holding environments.' As infants internalize the guarding, protecting, soothing and nurture of this 'holding environment' they begin to form a self (even if the environment is inadequate).\nThese early experiences then form our 'unconscious' drives for connection or separation. 'Real' others are 'used' to satisfy those drives, and we find others to validate our sense of self (good or bad). Health: achieving and preserving psychic wholeness through good object relations, integrating our 'unconscious' with our consciousness. Self and its relationships with others rest on and are expressed by the degree to which relations between the self and object are gratifying (but some theorists would suggest that since we are so narcissistic in the beginning, the relationships with others are never gratifying enough. Is it possible to be healthy?) Fairbairn suggest that as we internalize objects we are inevitably disappointed by them, in order to defend against this pain, we do the follow: We split off those aspects that are too painful to be tolerated.\nRepress these intolerable aspects. This modifies the ego. Pathology occurs when some aspects of the repressed self-object system are excessively repressed, leaving the central self depleted with an impoverished relationship to the 'ideal object.'\nOther forms of pathology occur when the central self system is taken over by one of the usual repressed systems, such as those whose relations are characterized by continual patterns of distance and rage with the apparent disappearance of reality. Fear-dictated flight from early object relations is also considered the deepest root of psychological problems. Skynner (1981) Diffuse boundaries\nUnclear identities\nSatisfaction from fantasy as opposed to reality\nDifficulty coping with separation and loss\nAttempts to preserve past states of relationships\nAttempts to manipulate others into rigidly held views of them The major goal of Object Relations Theory is to free family members of unconscious restrictions so that they will be able to interact with one another as whole, healthy persons on the basis of current realities rather than unconscious images. The encounter between the therapist and client is the intervention. The relationship is the crucible for change and growth. The therapeutic process is the same as 'normal development' during infancy. The therapist provides the holding environment, contains/introjects the clients' emotions, resolves them, understands them, somehow makes them acceptable, and then the client introjects the resolution of the emotions. Therapist projects back a 'corrective experience.'\nSelf of therapist is key: Transference and counter-transference are the keystones of any psychoanalytic therapy, meaning the therapist must constantly be aware of who they are' for the client, and who the client is for them. Change occurs through insight and working through. Techniques: Listening\nEmpathy\nInterpretation and maintaining neutrality with respect to what or how things change Big Picture (how families operate/develop): He uses attachment theory as a base. Early attachment relationships create 'working models' of how relationships are supposed to be, they create 'scripts.' as people interact with each other to become a family, they create their own 'family script' based on these early 'working models.' families have attachment patterns that are full of meanings about abandonment, engulfment, intrusion, etc. (i.e., distance regulation)\nThese scripts provide routines for family life which can be followed automatically. They are shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.\nThese scripts may be carried out from generation to generation in one form or another. Some use replicative scripts (repeat what has happened in the past), while others use corrective scripts (trying not to repeat scripts from the family of origin). There is a constant tension between these two. Healthy vs. Dysfunctional families Healthy families have scripts that provide a set of roles with which each member can identify and which provides room for improvisation when facing new situations. These scripts promote interactional awareness: Consequences of interaction\nSelf-awareness (why you are acting in a particular way)\nEmpathic awareness (why others are acting in particular ways)\nUnderstanding the meaning of the interaction\nShared coherent perception of what is happening Symptoms occur when there is difficulty updating scripts. They may occur because the script necessary remains someone or something too painful to relive. Intolerable information is blocked or edited both intraphysically and interpersonally (secrets)\\\nSymptoms may also occur when a family script is used to prevent what members may fear to be an even worse disaster. Even though the current script is painful, it is rigidly clung to (the solution has become to problem) Major goal is improvisation (flexibility). In order to create an environment safe enough to explore options however, the therapist must provide a secure base from which to explore. Paradoxically, scripts, although repetitive, provide the background against which change can occur. Attachment notions Secure\nCurious\nImprovisation\nUncertainty\nInsecure\nAvoid strangeness\nStick with the familiar Instead of conflict in the family arising out of one person's pathology which extends to influence another's behavior, family scripts are encoded in all family members' minds, but each family member plays a particular role. Therefore, each member of the family can be taught to see how their role contributes to the problem, rather than asking the 'sick one' to reown the bad object and working through these issues. Reduce strategies that undermine problem-solving abilities (i.e., triangulating, scapegoating, etc.)\nReduce strategies that undermine security (threats about leaving, control, etc.)\nMove toward collaboration rather than coercion and blame. Re-edit scripts so the roles are fillable by the individuals in the family. Move closer to an ideal script in which a wide scope of improvising is possible. Develop a hopeful script. Promote ownership of family's success, attributable to them not you as the therapist. This is still important for the therapist to attend to. The therapist needs to contain the family's emotions in a way so as not to become another player in their script. Therapists own scripts can also be replayed, thus it is essential that the therapist understand their own family script. Byng-Hall outlines methods for staying out of the script and for containing emotional impact: Staying out: Use teams, get supervision, have a clear plan, use circular questioning\nContaining: Reflecting on the process, seeing emotions as valuable information, differentiating your script from the family's, share your emotional experience with the family. Absolves people of responsibility for their behavior (it is my mother's fault)\nLack of empirical testing\nTautological thinking: Make an interpretation, it is rejected, patient is resistant, you must be onto something. Perspective is individualist or dyadic without revision. Deterministic, linear thinking (it is my mother's fault)\nBlaming the victim (you put yourself in this situation, because of what your mother did)\nMother blaming\nLong process\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Object Relations\" href=\"Object Relations\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Object Relations</a> Theory: Big Picture","level":2,"id":"[[Object_Relations]]_Theory_Big_Picture_0"},{"heading":"Stages of Object Relations","level":3,"id":"Stages_of_Object_Relations_0"},{"heading":"Health/Dysfunction","level":3,"id":"Health/Dysfunction_0"},{"heading":"Symptoms","level":3,"id":"Symptoms_0"},{"heading":"Dysfunctional Family","level":3,"id":"Dysfunctional_Family_0"},{"heading":"Intervention","level":3,"id":"Intervention_0"},{"heading":"Byng-Hall (1995) Family Scripts","level":2,"id":"Byng-Hall_(1995)_Family_Scripts_0"},{"heading":"Symptoms","level":2,"id":"Symptoms_1"},{"heading":"Interventions","level":2,"id":"Interventions_0"},{"heading":"Difference from other Psychoanalytic Models","level":2,"id":"Difference_from_other_Psychoanalytic_Models_0"},{"heading":"Intervention Strategies","level":2,"id":"Intervention_Strategies_0"},{"heading":"Transference/Countertransference","level":2,"id":"Transference/Countertransference_0"},{"heading":"Critique of Psychoanalytic Theories","level":2,"id":"Critique_of_Psychoanalytic_Theories_0"}],"links":["glossary/cft-keywords/object-relations.html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/family-theory-ii-(hdfs-8875)/lecture/4.-psychoanalytic-models-of-family-therapy/4.-psychoanalytic-models-of-family-therapy.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1705619815055,"modifiedTime":1724752004882,"sourceSize":9272,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Family Theory II (HDFS 8875)/Lecture/4.

I understand why you may think that way.' You want the couples to learn how to validate someone else's perspective. Not agreeing with it, but just expanding the ability for a person to have compassion for others. Getting couples to ask for what You have been with me long enough you should know. Opening up of relational issues. People cannot be in a relationship and give nothing. Keep looking for their contribution. Want couples to validate each other and themselves. As people acknowledge that other people make contributions (due consideration), we feel that we are getting the due consideration.

Once we accept our aloneness then we have to make meaning for our lives. \"We believe people who love us should 'just know' what we need.\"\nWe have to accept we are a self. Once we accept our aloneness, we must make meaning of our lives. Freedom and Responsibility\nHumanistic Psychology: Humans are good and move toward growth if unhindered. Whitaker and others claim to be a-theoretical. However, Whitaker was a systems theorist and used ideas from humanistic psychology and psychoanalytic theory to guide his therapy. <a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a> thought he could change a family behind a mirror by telling a therapist what to do. Experiential therapists did not believe this is true. They want the family to be open to their emotional experience and thoughts they are having. Anti-Technician: Rather than a-theoretical, Whitaker and other experiential therapists are anti-technician. Manipulation does not encourage open experiencing. Through feeling expression, families are able to balance separateness and connectedness. Always 'becoming' or moving forward, toward growth. Emotions/affect are validated and nurtured. Rules create balance: respect for affect and getting along. Permeable boundaries which encourage expression of intimacy needs, differentiation, bonding, conflict expression/resolution, problem solving, and playfulness. Symptoms develop when affect is blocked, impulses are denied and feelings are suppressed. Boundaries and processes are rigid: holding themselves together is more important than experiencing life. Superficial experience of emotion, self-denial, lack of empathy, lack of commitment, inability to handle conflict\nLittle awareness, little sense of choice, flow of behavior is blocked because of unexpressed emotion.\n<br><a data-href=\"Carl Whitaker\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Carl Whitaker</a> suggested that there were 3 contexts to our symptoms: 'Driven Crazy' in an interpersonal context in which person is belittled or disqualified.\n'Going Crazy' a state of temporary disorganization.\n'Acting Crazy' an adaptation to the context. Increased personal integrity, greater freedom of choice, less dependence, expanded experiencing. Strengthening the family as a system by increasing connectedness within the nuclear family and across generations. Enhance ability to support the completion of developmental tasks. Battle for Structure\nBattle for Initiative\nWorking Phase\nTermination\nUse of non-rational, symbol, and metaphor. Use of self is paramount: any technique comes from the therapist's creativity. Create a new therapeutic environment to alter the family's interaction in hopes of producing a different affective experience. Interrupt rigid, repetitive cycles\nActivate and allow for constructive anxiety or confusion. Expand the presenting problem\nEncourage and support any new decision (freedom to choose). Create trans-generational boundaries. Create a therapeutic supra-system in which the therapist and family are aligned, and the therapist still has the ability to differentiate (get in and get out). Self-Worth: How people learn to be people Communication: The ways people use to work out meaning with one another (Placating, Blaming, Computing, Distracting, Leveling/Congruence) Placating (peacekeeper)\nBlamer (im not happy its your fault)\nComputing (have to have a rational explanation, ultra rationale)\nDistracting (acts out when there is stress, someone who uses humor)\nLeveling/Congruence Rules: The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into the family system. Freedom to comment: What can you say\nTo whom can you say it\nHow do you go about it if you disagree or disapprove of someone or something\nHow do you question when you do not understand\nTaboo subjects\nTaboo feelings\nExpressing affection\nSecrets Overarching goal may be to loosen up the system so there is freedom to comment. Maybe you say it yourself, maybe use family sculpting, Link to Society: How the family interacts with the outside world When communication patterns are rigid (other than congruence) and continual, and you can't comment on that.\nSymptoms are symptoms of the system\nSymptoms are created through the process of interaction Low self-worth\nCommunication is indirect, vague, not honest\nRules are rigid and non-negotiable\nLink to society is fearful, placating, and blaming Congruence (you the therapist must be congruent) (as a therapist, when you have a sense of what is going on in the room, you say it\n“Recording 20240412103404.webm” could not be found.\n)\n- Only with congruence can we know each other fully and we can use our differences creatively. Focus of intervention Helping people change and grow in: Communication\nBeliefs about being able to grow\nRestoring the use of all the senses Therapist use of self is key (as with all experiential models) To alleviate symptoms you have to intervene in the process in a way that won't replicate their process.

He went to Syracuse University where he earned his M.D. in 1936. Whitaker first went into obstetrics and gynecology, but then switched to become a psychiatrist. During WWII, he worked in Oak Ridge, Tennessee (top-secret project developing the atomic bomb was located). He was mainly self-taught which made his take on a co-therapist, which became a mainstay of his practice. In 1946, Whitaker was named chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University. <br>In 1956, he and colleagues opened the Atlanta Psychiatric clinic, a private practice where his approach, <a data-href=\"Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/symbolic-experiential-family-therapy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy</a>, was further developed. In 1965, Whitaker moved back into academia, taking a position in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin. Books include The Family Crucible and Dancing with the Family Psychology of the Absurd (1975) Blend of warm support and emotional goading. Around Whitakers time, psychologically troubled people were seen as alienated from feeling and frozen into devitalized routines. He worked with John Warkentin in 1943 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He pioneered the use of co-therapy in belief that a supportive partner helped free the therapist to react without fear of countertransference. Whitaker never seems to have an obvious strategy and did not use predictable techniques. He let his unconscious run therapy. He believed all interventions promoted flexibility. He challenged the family to open up and become more fully themselves and more fully together. Whitaker organized a series of forums which eventually led to the Convention of Family Therapy Movement. In 1946, Whitaker began twice yearly conferences where clinicians observed and discussed work with families. He developed mutual observation and using one-way mirrors which became a hallmark of family therapy. In 1955, Whitaker entered a private practice at the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic and developed experiential-form of psychotherapy, treating families, individuals, groups, and couples. In the late 70 s, Whitaker mellowed out and added greater understanding of family dynamics.

Questions/Open Invitation to Talk: Open vs. Closed Questions\n- Open questions often begin with what, how, or could. They help the client explore issues and talk at greater length.\n- Closed questions often begin with do, is, are, and lead to focused answers, often shorter in length.\n- Clarifying - Encourage, Restate, Paraphrase:\n- Encourages are brief responses such as head nods, \"Uh-huh,\" and single words or phrases.\n- They encourage client depth exploration and bring clarity as to meaning. Appropriate smiling is one of the most important encourages.\n- Restatement:\n- In the restatement you select several key words and repeat the back exactly. It works like an encourager, but focuses in more depth on a key issue.\n- Paraphrase:\n- The paraphrase feeds back to the client the essence of what has been said. The paraphrase provides a check on the accuracy of your listening and may enable the client to move on to a new topic.\n- Reflection of Feeling/Responding to Emotion:\n- Reflection of feeling is concerned with identifying and feeding back to the client the underlying emotional experience.\n- Exploration of emotion is basic to understanding a client's deeper desires and wishes.\n- Clarifying emotion leads to better client decision making and action.\n- Summarization:\n- This skill asks you to feed back to the client the essence of longer statements or a whole interview.\n- Many summarizations will include descriptions of behavior, thoughts, and emotion.\n- This skill is useful in clarifying what has happened in key interview segments and in beginning and ending the interview.\n- Integration of Skills - Five Stages of the Interview:\nSelf-of-the-therapist work is the willingness of a therapist to participate in a process that requires introspective work on issues in their own life, that has an impact the process of therapy in both positive and negative ways.\nSelf-of-the-therapist work should focus on life events in such a way that therapists are able to see their past experiences as both potential obstacles and potential strengths. How do your life experiences help you to be more compassionate to your clients?\nHow do your life experiences allow you to understand your clients on a deeper level?\nHow can you use your previous life experiences to inform your work? What issues in therapy are 'too close to home'?\nHow are issues 'getting in the way'?\nWhat are potential 'blind spots' in the therapy room? Using a Both/And Perspective: Discuss themes in terms of how they could get in the way of successful therapy and how it helps you become a better therapist.\nCelebrate experiences not just pathologize them. Establish: Establish safety Strive: Strive for a balanced perspective that is inclusive of gender and culture. Process: Process therapist/supervisor and colleague/colleague relationships. Be: Be aware of dual-relationships. My Therapy House: Foundation: The things you bring to graduate school, self-of-the-therapist, who you are, what you stand for, experiences that shape you. House: This is your theory, items about your theory that fit with your foundation (should be seamless and purposeful) (worldview) Roof: Borrowed techniques from other theories that fit with your population of interest, theory, self-of-the-therapist. Chimney: How you evaluate that what you are doing is helpful, and your self-care plan. A process in which the therapist initiates a conversation with a family about similarities and differences in their key identities, such as race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and religion, and how they may potentially influence the therapy process.\nLocation of self begins with the therapist engaging in self-disclosure but continues beyond. The revelation of personal rather than professional information about the therapist to the client. When therapist disclosure goes beyond the standard professional disclosure of name, credentials, office addresses, fees, office policies, etc., it becomes self-disclosure.\nAppropriate clinically driven self-disclosures carried out for the clinical benefit of the clients and unavoidable (non-harming).\nSelf-disclosure that takes place in the community are considered boundary crossings.\nInappropriate self-disclosures are considered a boundary violation. Self-disclosure done for the benefit of the therapist\nClinically counter-indicated disclosures that burden the client with unnecessary information or creates a role reversal where a client takes care of the therapist. Different types of self-disclosure: Deliberate: Self-revealing\nSelf-involving Unavoidable\nAccidental\nClients' deliberate actions What is the therapist's intent?\nThe decision to self-disclose is based first and foremost on the welfare of the client. Intentional and deliberate self-disclosure is made under the general moral and ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#HDFS-8189"],"headers":[{"heading":"Stages of Therapist Development:","level":3,"id":"Stages_of_Therapist_Development_0"},{"heading":"Stage 1: Essential Skills:","level":4,"id":"Stage_1_Essential_Skills_0"},{"heading":"Basic Skills:","level":5,"id":"Basic_Skills_0"},{"heading":"Advanced Skills:","level":5,"id":"Advanced_Skills_0"},{"heading":"The Microskills Hierarchy:","level":5,"id":"The_Microskills_Hierarchy_0"},{"heading":"Stage 2: Conceptualizing Cases:","level":4,"id":"Stage_2_Conceptualizing_Cases_0"},{"heading":"Stage 3: Therapist as Self:","level":4,"id":"Stage_3_Therapist_as_Self_0"},{"heading":"Overview of Basic Attending Skills:","level":4,"id":"Overview_of_Basic_Attending_Skills_0"},{"heading":"Self-of-Therapist:","level":3,"id":"Self-of-Therapist_0"},{"heading":"Self of the Therapist Work:","level":4,"id":"Self_of_the_Therapist_Work_0"},{"heading":"Potential Resources:","level":5,"id":"Potential_Resources_0"},{"heading":"Potential Restraints:","level":5,"id":"Potential_Restraints_0"},{"heading":"Person of the Therapist vs. Use of Self:","level":4,"id":"Person_of_the_Therapist_vs._Use_of_Self_0"},{"heading":"Doing Self of the Therapist Work:","level":4,"id":"Doing_Self_of_the_Therapist_Work_0"},{"heading":"Person of the Therapist vs. Use of Self:","level":4,"id":"Person_of_the_Therapist_vs._Use_of_Self_1"},{"heading":"Location of Self:","level":4,"id":"Location_of_Self_0"},{"heading":"Therapist Self-Disclosure:","level":4,"id":"Therapist_Self-Disclosure_0"}],"links":[".html","pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@iveybasicattendingskills.html#_0"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/lecture/2.-locating-ourselves.-self-of-therapist.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["media/school-diagrams/prevalence/the-microskills-hierarchy.png","media/school-diagrams/therapist-use-of-self-diagram.png"],"createdTime":1695234060681,"modifiedTime":1724751988047,"sourceSize":7178,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Pre-Practicum (8189.11)/Lecture/2.

System consists of attributes.\nInternal relationships among its objects (mutual effects).\nAn environment. They are affected by their surroundings. Wholeness and Interdependence: In a system, the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\nIt is a product of the forces or interactions among its parts. It's parts cannot be understood separately.\nThe interdependence creates organization in the system (e.g., a family). <br><a data-href=\"Hierarchy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hierarchy</a>: Systems tend to be embedded within one another.\nEvery complex system consists of subsystems. Given that systems are within systems, it is fuzzy as to where to locate the boundary between the system and the environment. Interchange with the Environment: Inputs and outputs.\nThe system affects and is affected by the environment. <br>Balance (<a data-href=\"Homeostasis\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Homeostasis</a>) Self-maintenance\nSensing deviations from the norm and correcting those 'faults.' Self-Regulation and Control: Systems are often viewed as goal-oriented.\nThey are governed by their purposes. The parts operate according to guidelines and adapt to the environment on the basis of feedback. This aspect of system functioning is cybernetics. Change and Adaptability: The system must adapt to its environment. Equifinality: A particular final state may be achieved in different ways. Family as a System: <br>This model of a family as a system is extrapolated from the work of <a data-href=\"Ludwig von Bertalanffy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a> and his <a data-href=\"General Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">General Systems Theory</a>.\nHolons: A single cell is made up of holons, just as a family is made up of individuals. <br><a data-href=\"Cybernetics\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cybernetics</a>: <br><a data-href=\"First-Order Cybernetics (1940s-1960s)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/first-order-cybernetics-(1940s-1960s).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">First-Order Cybernetics (1940s-1960s)</a>: Concepts: <br><a data-href=\"Homeostasis\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Homeostasis</a>\nControl of the Observed Mechanism\n<br><a data-href=\"Self-Steering\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Steering</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Information vs. Noise\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Information vs. Noise</a> Major Assumptions: Modern vs. Post Modern Level of analysis is the family or larger context.

Reality is self-referential (i.e., everything we know and see is based on our personal frame of reference). No reference to an outside environment. More to a System: Bounded: <br>A cell has a '<a data-href=\"Feedback Loop\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/feedback-loop.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Feedback Loop</a>,' enabling information to be transferred throughout the cell. All families have such a loop or <a data-href=\"Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Process</a> for communicating. Interdependent: All holons are interdependent on each other. Change one and you change the system.

This explains the difficulty of change within family systems. This thinking moves from linear causality to a more multi-dimensional approach to families. From A-&gt;B-&gt;C to interconnections between A, B, and C. Core Concepts: Problems: Understanding Problems: Your Clinical Theory\nLearning Problems vs. Problems about Learning\nProblems as Bad Solutions\nProblems arising from childhood wounds, outmoded, limiting coping styles\nProblems arising from Larger Societal Changes (and Issues) The Presenting Problem: A presenting problem is an initial symptom that causes a person to seek professional help. Describe the reason the client came to you. Include the client's definition of their problem. How long they've been experiencing the issue. Process: Understanding Process: <br><a data-href=\"Content\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/content.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Content</a>: Stories about what happened; shared at length and with extraneous details <br><a data-href=\"Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Process</a>: Access the client's internal experience and working through parts of it. Process Questions in Therapy: <br>When a client is discussing something important to them tell the initial story and listen until your client invites you to help them. Otherwise, and after initial sessions you should mostly ask '<a data-href=\"Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Process</a>' questions that: Focus on the client themselves and their internal experience\nHelp the client 'slow down' and reflect on ideas or feelings that seem significant\nUse immediacy to ask about emotions you're noticing in a moment\nFocus on themes, patterns, and affect Example of Process Questions in Therapy: \"What is it like for you when...\"\n\"I might be off here, but were you feeling... in that moment?\"\nWhen you notice heightened emotion, you can ask, \"What's coming up for you right now?\", \"How are you feeling, talking to me about this?\"\n\"What do you wish other people knew about what you are experiencing?\"\n\"Today or in our previous sessions, have you found yourself thinking 'I wish they'd ask me about....?\" \"What question do you need someone to ask you, that no one has?\"\n\"How did that make you feel about yourself, about your partner, about the relationship?\"\n\"What you just mentioned about X seems important, at least to me. Could we slow down and stay with this idea/feeling for a moment?\" Patterns: Observable repeated behavior, thoughts, or interaction that often manifest in human interaction and may manifest in therapy sessions. For example, a client may have a patter of shutting down emotionally or becoming distracted whenever you approach painful material. Writing a Systemic Hypothesis: Circular Questioning: Circular questioning is a technique used in systemic family therapy to 'invite participants in a conversation to consider relational aspects of the topic being investigated.' Ask open questions to explore communication and relationship patterns Types of Circular Questions: Bridging the Past: Circular questions bridge the past and the present together to find a moment in time when a shift in the family occurred. If this moment can be identified, it can give clues as to how to help the family. Has conflict always happened like this in your family?\nWhat was it like before?\nWhen did it start happening like this? Thirds: Circular questioning often asks a third person for their thoughts on how a dyad operates. This often breaks an unspoken rule in families that states, 'We don't comment about others.' This technique invites reflection on how two people's actions impact the behavior or mood of another. These questions are often used to assess how families respond to their members in different situations. \"Dad, when Son is showing signs of depression, what do you see Mom do?\"\n\"Mom, when Dad is taking care of Son, what do you think Dad gets out of?\" Differences: When a behavior occurs or a significant change occurred different family members reacted in different ways. Circular questions help us understand the different ways people reacted and from that we can gauge how close people are, or how distant, enmeshment, and various other ideas. How is this different than before?\nWho is most likely to comfort...?\nWho is least likely?\nHas this always been true?

Preparation: The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change) Action: The person is in active modification of behavior. Maintenance: Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional. Relapse: The person falls back into old patterns of behavior. Upward Spiral: Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating Specific Factors: Elements clearly delineated by proponents of a given therapy as the active causes of change. Empirically Supported Relationships: Therapeutic interventions that possess empirical support for the efficacy of the therapeutic relationship, client values and beliefs, and the working alliance between client and therapist.

What if Types of Clinical Assessment: Two broad approaches to assessment: Systemic Approach\nPostmodern Approach Formal Assessments: Formal assessment involves the use of tools such as tests, questionnaires, checklists and rating scales. Formal assessments often have data to determine their reliability and validity. Examples: Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Questionnaire (GAD7) - Individual <br><a data-href=\"GAD-7 (1).pdf\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GAD-7 (1).pdf</a> Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9) - Individual <br><a data-href=\"PHQ9.pdf\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PHQ9.pdf</a> Experiences of Close Relationships Scale - Couple Informal Assessments: Unstructured: Writing or drawing activities\nJournals\nGames\nObservation Structured: Checklists\nRating Scales\nInterviews\nQuestionnaires The mental status examination is a structured assessment of the patient's behavioral and cognitive functioning. In general, the components of a mental status exam include descriptions of the following: Appearance: Casual dress, normal grooming and hygiene. Attitude: Calm and cooperative General Behavior: Unusual movements or psychomotor changes Speech and Language: Normal rate/tone/volume and without pressure Emotions: Reactive and mood congruent, labile, tearful, blunted, normal range, depressed, constricted, flat Mood: Euthymic, irritable, elevated, anxious, depressed Thought and Perception: Goal-directed and logical or disorganized\nSuicidal ideation: passive, active, plan?\nHomicidal ideation: passive, active plan?\nHallucinations or delusions during interview Cognition\nOrientation: oriented to time, place, person, self Biopsychosocial Model: “Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 10.25.48 AM.png” could not be found.\nA Biopsychosocial Assessment is an assessment typically conducted by therapists at the beginning of therapy, which assesses for biological, psychological, and social factors that can be contributing to a problem or problems with a client. Biopsychosocial Assessments enable therapist to diagnose and effectively treat clients. Tasks and Process of Assessment: Make Initial Contact\nDevelop a collaborative therapeutic relationship\nUse a bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual assessment: Person-in-Environment\nDefining problems\nAssessing safety\nAccessing and appreciating patient/clients' strengths\nAssess systems collaboration issues and strengths\nExpand awareness and perspectives\nAssess goals Biopsychosocial Assessment Areas: Demographic Information (Age, Ethnicity, Religion, Relational Status, Referral Status, etc.)\nHistory of the Presenting Problem\nPsychiatric History\nTrauma History\nFamily Psychiatric History\nMedical History\nMedication Use\nSubstance Use\nFamily History (Family of Origin, Relationship with Parents, Siblings, etc.)\nSocial History\nSpiritual/Cultural Factors\nDevelopmental History\nEducational/Vocational History\nLegal History\nSNAP (Strength, Needs, Abilities, Preferences)\nOther Important Information Guiding Principles for Assessment: A systemic view: Everything is connected Foundational importance of bio-physiological, psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual domains in relation to multiple service systems\nA strengths-based perspective\nAssessment as an ongoing process Regular screening and tracking during sessions of the following: Health status\nMobility\nWellness Exercise\nNutrition\nSleep Ensure that client has primary care physician\nCommunicate with primate care physician or other health providers as needed. General Psychological Issues: Cognitive skills and ability (e.g.. thought process, problem-solving/decision-making skills)\nBehavioral skills\nEmotional competencies: Affect regulation\nCapacity for relating Motivational factors Overall mental status\nRisk Assessment\nSpecific Mental Health Concerns: Depression\nAnxiety\nSubstance Use Appropriate referral if needed\nOngoing communication between external providers (collaboration of care) Risk Assessment includes consideration of psychological and social factors as part of a comprehensive review to capture client needs, and to assess their risk of harm to themselves or others. Assessments often aim to categorize patients as at high, medium, or low risk\nExamples of risk areas include: Suicidal ideation\nHomicidal ideation\nChild abuse/neglect\nIntimate partner violence\nPhysical health issues or crises Inability to care for self or others Animal abuse\nSubstance abuse Important factors: Level of risk\nIntent to act\nPlan to act\nMeans to act\nRisk and protective factors Assessing Strengths: Personal and Relational Strengths: Bio-physiological\nPsychological\nSociocultural\nSpiritual 'Strengths' of the problem/symptoms\nStrengths in systems collaboration Exploring the 'Strengths' and Potential 'Contributions' of the Problem When was the last time that you realized that the problem was helpful to you?\nIf your problem has a voice, what do you think it is trying to share or communicate with you?\nHow might the problem be helpful to you?\nIf we could get rid of the problem, what might be some aspect of it that you might want to retain? Useful Questions for Assessing Strengths: What has been helpful so far?\nWhat are some of your successes?\nWhat are the achievements that you are most proud of having accomplished?\nWhat little things are you doing that make life a little better for you?\nWhat kinds of things do people compliment you on?\nWhen have you stopped doing something that was difficult for you to stop?\nWhen have you made an important change in your life that was difficult to make?\nWhen have you broken a habit that was hard to break? Outcomes of Assessment: Problems: Bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual perspective\nProblem and attempted solutions specifically and behaviorally described (SOLVABLE). Goals: Desired future outcomes\nSpecifically and behaviorally described (ATTAINABLE)\nProfessional and the patient/client mutually agree to the described problems and goals. Treatment plan and interventions based on mutual consensus of problem and goal David A. Jobes, Ph.D. Creator of CAMS Framework Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) It is a therapeutic framework for suicide-specific assessment and treatment of a patient's suicidal risk. It is a flexible approach that can be used across theoretical orientations and disciplines for a wide range of suicidal patients across treatment settings and different treatment modalities. Every session of CAMS intentionally utilizes the patient's input about what is and is not working. All assessment work in CAMS is collaborative. The clinician's honesty and forthrightness are key elements. The CAMS clinician endeavors to understand their patient's suffering from an empathic, nonjudgemental, and intra-subjective perspective. The clinician never shames or blames a suicidal person for being suicidal. Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments for Suicide: Three evidence-based (randomized controlled trials) interventions and treatments that are designed to directly target suicide at risk. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)\nCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT): Suicide Prevention (CT-SP) and Brief CBT.

Don't take things personally from clients. How do you\nWhat would be the ideal way to approach feedback? How is it realistic? How would you like me to respond? How can we acknowledge it being received. Ethical Concerns and Telehealth: Remember our ethical imperatives for in-person therapy. Rely on common factors\nRely on our professional standards of practice AAMFT Code of Ethics\nCoalition for Technology in Behavioral Science (CTiBS) TBH Competencies Know and adhere to legal guidelines (federal and state)\nContinue education and training. Seek supervision. Assessing Appropriateness for Telehealth: Conduct an initial assessment of the client to determine if telehealth is appropriate. Conduct ongoing assessment to determine appropriateness to receive services via teletherapy throughout the court of treatment. Consider: Current Mental and Emotional Status\nIs the treatment model conducive to telehealth?\nIs the current delivery of the service effective?\nDoes the client have the technological ability and resources necessary? A client may be inappropriate for telehealth if: Recurrently experiences, or is likley to experience, crises or emergencies. Is a suicide risk, or likely to become a suicide risk. Has a history of previous non-suicidal self-injury. Is violent, or likely to become violent. Risk Management in Telehealth: Suicidality\nHomicidality\nChild Abuse/Neglect\nIntimate Partner Violence\nAnimal Abuse\nPhysical Health Issues or Crises\nObtain your client's physical location at the start of each session. Complete Address\nMake, Model, Color of Car\nNearest Physical Location Obtain a client's emergency contact at initial intake and review regularly Physical Location\nDistance from the Client (nearest ETA) Obtain contact information for local emergency resources: Local police and fire departments\nLocal Crisis Centers\nFamily Pediatrician/PCP\nNational Crisis Numbers Safety Assessment: Is it safe for them to return or remain home&gt;\nAre there weapons in the house?\nAre the children in danger?\nIs the violence escalating?\nAre they unwilling to complete a safety plan?\nIs their situation too severe and they require a higher level of care?\nThe most important intervention a therapist can use when working with a suicidal client is compassion for the pain they are in and patience in listening to their story. What is a Safety Plan? A safety plan is a prioritized written list of coping strategies and sources of support developed by a clinician in collaboration with clients who are at high risk for suicide. A safety plan is not a 'no-suicide contract,' which is not recommended by experts in the field of suicide prevention. As generally used, no-suicide contracts asks clients to promise stay alive without telling them how to stay alive. Safety Planning: Safety planning incorporates elements of four evidence-based suicide risk reduction strategies: Reducing Access to Lethal Means\nTeaching Brief Problem Solving and Coping Skills\nEnhancing Social Support and Identifying Emergency Contacts\nUsing Motivational Enhancement to Increase likelihood of Engagement in Further Treatment Assessing for Child Abuse on Video Session: On a video call, observe how the house appears: Look for ongoing sings that go beyond messiness. Is perishable good sitting out after multiple calls?\nIs there an absence of food or do family members appear to be losing weight?\nAre there signs of pests or rodents?\nDo children appear significantly unkempt or not bathed? Look for signs of increased frustration. This is a time of great stress for parents, ask questions to see how well a parent is coping. \"How are things going with the kids?\"\n\"What are you getting to do during the day?\" Speak with the Children: Ask for time to speak with the children along. Observe their reactions to who and what is around them. What is their level of focus?\nDo they seem particularly stressed or emotional?\nIs their behavior atypical? Be Understanding: If a parent is expressing desperation, be empathetic. It is normal for parents to express frustration with statements such as 'being over it' or 'giving up.'\nRed flags for a listener include: Over rigidity\nPersistent expression of negative emotions\nInability to see beyond their immediate concern\nExtreme frustration that suggest possible escalation to physical aggression Telepresence and Virtual Professionalism: Telebehavioral health (TBH) professionals can demonstrate how to apply appropriate techniques to maximize therapeutic atmosphere in both physical and virtual environments as well as minimize distraction and interruptions. Professionals can show how to approximate an in-person relationship and foster spontaneity through TBH. Creating a Virtual Office: When setting up your virtual office, we must consider the following: Physical Location\nPrivacy\nLighting\nComfort Where is your home based or online office located physically? Is it near a power source?\nIs there a way to 'close the door' to your office? (i.e., is there at least a door between your office space and other common areas in your location?)\nIs it a high traffic area? How can you create a distraction free environment? Turn off anything that makes noise. A sign outside the door can help remind others not to make noise during the session. Avoid a space with lots of clutter on the desk. Be mindful of what is behind you in the camera's view. How can you create a quality video image? Make sure you are well lit. Are there shadows being cast on my face?\nAm I lit well enough to see me clearly?\nFind the best source of lighting. Overhead light (may not be the best)\nDesk Lamp\nSingle Floor Lamp (Often Good: 4-5 ft, bulbs point up to the ceiling) Make sure your camera is well placed. Eye level with the camera straight at you (ideal). Practice good posture (use the picture-in-picture) How can you create a therapeutic environment? Find an office space with minimal distractions or a solid color background. Be mindful of clothing to limit distractions. Solid colors are best\nAvoid busy patterns\nAvoid large jewelry and hats Before the First Session: Provide clear instructions to your clients about how to join the session. Become aware of common technical problems that could arise and how to trouble shoot for these problems. If possible, host a test call. Both therapist and client obtain contact information in case of technology failure. During the First Session: Ask for initial feedback for sound and video quality\nAllow for more time for interviews\nRemain attentive\nKeep eyes on camera\nAvoid distracting behavior and excessive movement\nTurn off anything that makes noise\nRemain in view of camera at all times\nBe mindful of possible delays and lags in video\nSpeak slowly and deliberately Understanding Telebehavioral Health Competencies: Clinical Evaluation and Care\nVirtual Environment and Telepresence\nTechnology\nLegal &amp; Regulatory Issues\nEvidence-Based &amp; Ethical Practice\nMobile Health Technologies Including Applications (Apps)\nTelepractice Development Telebehavioral Health Competency Levels: Novice: Identify and describe issues\nConduct basic screening\nList pros and cons of using various technologies\nProtect security, privacy, and confidentiality\nEducate clients about fundamental TBH, laws, rules, regulations, ethical requirements, policies, procedures, assessments, interventions, standards and communication styles. Proficient\nAuthority: Demonstrate the basics of using computers, remote patient monitoring, social media and mobile health and the issues related to recommending the use of apps.

Clinical Writing and Documentation","icon":"","description":"\nClinical documentation is a tool that guides the clinical process and aids in measuring outcomes. Client documentation provides the content required for clients' clinical chart, also known as the medical record or health record. Medical/Health records are legal documents and are protexted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) When you meet with a client for the first time, you gather background information and outline policies and procedures for the therapy process. An Intake Note allows you to document a full biopsychosocial evaluation of your client, including the presenting problem, a mental status exam, and history. Is also allows you to document other important events that occur during the intake process, such as obtaining informed consent for treatment, reviewing practice policies and procedures, and discussing important topics like confidentiality and billing.

A Treatment Plan must be completed prior to completing a Progress Note for a client's first scheduled Therapy Session after their intake session. This is because the Diagnosis, Objectives, and Frequency of Treatment are initially recorded on a client's Treatment Plan and pull forward into subsequent Progress Notes for the client. Diagnosis\nPresenting Problem\nTreatment Goals\nTreatment Objectives\nTreatment Strategy/Interventions\nFrequency and Duration of Treatment\nEvaluation: Measuring Progress and Outcomes Progress notes, are the official record of each therapy session. They're meant to be shared with other members of the client's care team and insurers when requested. Progress notes include information such as diagnoses, interventions used, and progress toward treatment plan goals. SOAP Notes:\nSubjective: This section details the session from the client's perspective. It includes information like the client's feelings on their progress or lack of progress, the effectiveness of therapy, and goals for the session. Objective: Next, you'll list your own observations of the client's overall demeanor, attitude toward therapy, how they responded to the interventions you used, and any results you achieved. Assessment: In this section, you'll digest the information from the above two secions and record your professional opinion. Include data like your clinical impressions and evaluations of their progress towards treatment goals. Plan: Here's where you'll lay out your course of action moving forward. What do you plan to address in the next session, and what interventions do you plan on using? How does your plan relate to the client's short and long-term treatment goals? Key Things: All clinical documentation including progress notes should be completed within 24–48 hours of the session or non-clinical event. Failure to complete notes in a timely manner is an ethical violation. Progress notes and other clinical records are legal documents. They fall under several laws and protections. Notes and other forms of documentation should be written with care. Write your notes 'as if the client is standing over your shoulder.' Psychotherapy notes are defined as notes recorded by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of conversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session that are separated from the rest of the individual's medical record. Therapist may keep psychotherapy notes separate from patient's records. Written by mental health professional to document/analyze conversations during counseling session. The following information is not to be included in process notes: Medication\nStart and stop of sessions\nModalities and frequency of treatment\nResults of clinical tests\nSummaries of diagnosis, functional status, treatment plan, symptoms, prognosis, and progress to date. Contact notes are non-clinical notes used to document communication between a staff member and a client or a client's contact. If you intend to charge for the communication, a Contact also creates a billing line item. The termination note is a non-billable note template used to record a client's discharge from treatment. A discharge note, also called a termination note, is a written summary held in the client's chart of what happened during the time the client was in your care. The discharge note also includes recommendations for future mental health care needs and referrals to help the client follow through on these recommendations. To write a discharge note we should include: Reasons for termination, including referrals to new providers\nSymptoms at the time of intake\nInitial reasons for seeking treatment\nDiagnosis\nTreatment goals, past and present\nModalities and interventions used and how the client responded Progress (or lack thereof) made during treatment Tips on Writing Clinical Documents: Client Progress Notes are Legal Documents\nUse the correct words (avoid jargon)\nBeware of acronyms and abbreviations\nKeep your entry professional\nAcknowledge that Progress Notes contain confidential information and should be kept in a secure location.

This new interpretation may then facilitate positive change. Common reframes are related to negative or blaming statements, negative behaviors of system memebers, or difficult family situations. There are three main goals of reframing: The first is to change the meaning of the problem(s) or behaviors. Reframes provide system members with a potentially different direction to proceed in their situation. Successful reframes connect system members together through the creation of a joint system focus.

Parents are your allies as well as members of the system. This gives them a unique position. Keep in mind ages and stages. When parents bring children to therapy, they are likely experiencing helplessness. They are tired. Don't go it alone! Assessment and treatment often require referrals. Allow everyone's voice to be heard. The family life cycle theory was first developed around 1960.

Professionals can show how to approximate an in-person relationship and foster spontaneity through TBH. When setting up your virtual office we must consider the following: Physical location\nPrivacy\nLighting\nComfort Where is your home based or online office located physically? Is it near a power source?\nIs there a way to 'close the door' to your office? (i.e., is there at least a door between your office space and other common areas in your location?)\nIs it in a high traffic area? How can you create a distraction free environment? Turn off anything that makes noise\nA sign outside the door can help remind others not to make noise during the session\nAvoid a space with lots of clutter on the desk\nBe mindful of what is behind you in the camera's view How can you create a quality video image? Make sure you are well lit. Are there shadows being cast on my face?\nAm I lit well enough to see me clearly?\nFind the best source of lighting. Overhead light (may not be the best)\nDesk lamp\nSingle floor lamp (often good; 4-5 ft.; bulbs point up to the ceiling) Make sure your camera is well placed. Eye level with the camera straight at you (ideal) Practice good posture (use the picture in picture) How can you create a therapeutic environment? Find an office space with minimal distractions or a solid color background. Be mindful of clothing to limit distractions Solid colors are best\nAvoid busy patterns\nAvoid large jewelry and hats Learning to relax\nBe present\nJoining\nEmpathic listening\nCuriosity\nAttending skills Assessment\nDiagnosis\nCase conceptualization\nTreatment planning\nTheory based interventions Couples therapy is dyadic.

Chapter 1 identifies concerns that new therapists frequently have, such as building confidence in their clinical work. Chapters 2-6 follow the usual time sequence of therapy--from initial contact with clients, to comprehensive assessment, to treatment planning and intervention. Chapters 7-10 deal with specific clinical situations based on presenting problems and the nature of client families. We examine major issues and approaches for working with children and adolescents, older adults, couples, and families that are struggling with serious mental illness. Chapter 11 highlights some common obstacles all therapists encounter, and provides concrete ideas on how to get unstuck when treatment is not progressing. Chapter 12 focuses on an often overlooked part of therapy--termination. In Chapter 13, we conclude the book by looking at emerging issues within family therapy\" While family therapy offers a unique and important perspective in clinical work, much of what goes on in treatment shares common assumptions with all therapies.\nassessing the appropriateness of a family therapy treatment for a specific problem is an essential clinical skill. It is important to be able to recognize when a problem is outside the scope of a family therapist’s practice (or skill level) and could best be treated by another mental health professional or in tandem with another healthcare professional.\nA growing focus on treatment teams and multidisciplinary treatment approaches means that therapists must increasingly attend to the biological component of the biopsychosocial model and learn to collaborate with other healthcare professionals. Beginning therapists frequently experience feelings of inadequacy and insecurity about their clinical abilities Therapists and supervisors alike need to see confidence issues from a developmental perspective Paradoxically, the more one learns about how to do therapy, the more one realizes how much one doesn’t know.\nAlthough the intensity of these feelings and the ways of coping will vary from therapist to therapist, every beginning therapist struggles to some degree with these feelings.\nThis disclosure helps the beginning therapist to accept that these struggles are developmentally appropriate rather than a sign of being unsuited for the profession\nthe therapist–client relationship is inherently therapeutic. A therapist doesn’t need to do something for clients to have a positive experience.\nearly experiences in seeing clients often involve a steep learning curve\nIt takes time, however, to gain enough experience so that many situations become familiar.\nexamine if distorted cognitions or unrealistic expectations are contributing to their fears or struggles with confidence. Beginning therapists can struggle with perfectionistic tendencies or critical self-talk\nThe only pathway to becoming an experienced therapist was to go through the learning process that he was going through\nExperienced clinicians indicated that after 5–7 years (or about 5,000–7,000 hours) of clinical experience, they had encountered most clinical issues or problems several times.\nThe intense feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed that are common in the beginning generally subside after 1–3 months of seeing clients. Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, “self of the therapist” stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work\nThe initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family. Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.\nLearning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist’s ability to listen and attend to the client’s story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about “doing something” with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins. The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.\nTo be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics. “I know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I’m stuck in the content.” Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan\nMany therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work\nTherapists’ unresolved issues or “growth areas” can become impediments in therapy.\nThe growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy. Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.\nOne reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.\nTherapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors. Learning to do therapy can be demanding.\nTherapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work\nThe courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy. To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)\nBe willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.\nYou also need a strong social support network Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.\nConnecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable Keep the “big picture” in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.\nKeep the following ‘reminders’ at hand:** Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.\nMake sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.\nSelf-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.\nUse the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities. The first contact is about to take place, and it can easily make or break a future collaboration where healing work can be done. One of the most critical points in the therapeutic experience: the period before therapy ever begins. During this fragile period prospective clients decide if they want to risk going to therapy. It is not uncommon for families to be at their wit's end when they finally decide to seek treatment or are referred and call for an appointment. Chances are they're worn out, fed up, and feeling hopeless. Individual family members may differ remarked For therapists and clients alike, beginning therapy can elicit feelings of fear, excitement, and nervous anticipation. Each client will take you on a different journey. In the first stage, the therapist welcomes the clients to therapy. The goal of this stage is to do introductions and put the clients at ease. Administrative issues are addressed in the second stage. The purpose of this stage is to ensure clients have a clear understanding of the therapy process, including confidentiality, videotaping, and fees. The goal-setting phase. Here the therapist learns what the clients hope to accomplish through therapy. The time devoted to goal setting will also depend on the number of clients being seen. Soliciting everyone’s perspective on goals within a family will generally take longer than working with an individual. Being able to establish goals for therapy is a realistic expectation. Assessment phase, which typically extends beyond the first interview. Therapist needs to accomplish several important tasks to make the initial interview successful. At each stage of the initial interview, you should be working on building your relationship with your clients. Important assessment information may also come out at any point in the first session, even before the therapist has begun a more formal assessment phase. The most crucial task of therapy is to successfully join with your clients.<br>\n- <a data-href=\"Joining\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Joining</a> means that clients feel a sense of connectedness with you, which usually arises when they feel you understand, respect, and care about them. Joining is both a technique (developing rapport) and an attitude.\n- It is the foundation for future work. Failure to successfully join with your clients will hamper all of your efforts, from assessment to treatment.<br>\n- Failure to join with clients can lead to <a data-href=\"Premature Termination (PT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/premature-termination-(pt).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Premature Termination (PT)</a> of therapy.\n- The therapist missed an opportunity to connect with the client and create a safe environment for therapy to take place.\n- Joining is a process that should be carefully attended to throughout the entire initial interview.\n- When you begin the session, you should attempt to put your clients at ease given that they are most likely anxious about coming to therapy.\n- Ideally, you will be able to identify something you have in common with your clients that will help develop a sense of connection.\n- Joining also takes place at other points throughout the initial interview.\n- Highlight\nReflective listening, maintaining direct eye contact, or leaning forward can also reinforce for your clients that you are interested in them and concerned about what they are saying. Concluding the initial interview with a positive message for your clients can be another way to strengthen your connection.\n-\nHighlight\nAlthough skills to facilitate joining can be learned\n-\nHighlight\ndeveloping a relationship with another person cannot be reduced to a recipe or set of techniques.\n-\nHighlight\nwho you are is the greatest asset you bring to therapy. Your personality, attitudes, life experiences, and compassion become a part of and help create the relationship.\n-\nHighlight\ntherapist characteristics can create a barrier to developing a connection. Therapists who have prejudices or negative preconceptions\n-\nHighlight\nabout people based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or religious orientation will likely have difficulty establishing a connection with clients who have these characteristics.\n-\nHighlight\nyou should be vigilant in assuring that personal issues or prejudices do not interfere with your developing a relationship with your clients.\n-\nHighlight\nOne of the early tasks in an initial interview is to address administrative issues so clients understand the therapy process.\n-\nHighlight\nthe therapist who is attuned to the process and not just the content when handling administrative issues may discover important opportunities for assessment or even intervention.\n-\nHighlight\nneed to be informed not only of the confidential nature of therapy, but also of the possible exceptions to confidentiality\n-\nHighlight\nIt is best practice to cover confidentially both orally and in writing with your client. The consent form for treatment\n-\nHighlight\nshould include what is and what is not kept confidential in therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nTherapists working with couples and families must also consider how confidentiality among family members will be handled.\n-\nHighlight\nThe therapist must address the extent to which information obtained during these individual sessions will be kept confidential or shared with other family members.\n-\nHighlight\noffer clear guidelines as to the bounds of confidentiality at the beginning of therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nYou may want to consult with other individuals or institutions connected with particular cases, such as previous therapists, psychiatrists, physicians, teachers, lawyers, courts, or parole officers.\n-\nHighlight\nneed to have clients sign a release of information form,\n-\nHighlight\nto permit communication between you and the other parties.\n-\nHighlight\nThe signatures of all participants in therapy are required for the release of information.\n-\nHighlight\nIf others contact you about your clients, you should not even acknowledge that they are in therapy unless you have obtained the appropriate release of information.\n-\nHighlight\nobtain a written release of information before discussing a case.\n-\nHighlight\nTherapeutic issues may arise when discussing confidentiality with clients.\n-\nHighlight\nYou can tell your clients that you regularly consult with your supervisor, and that videotaping allows your supervisor to witness firsthand what happened in therapy.\n-\nHighlight\n“two heads are better than one.”\n-\nHighlight\nvideotaping allows you to review what happened in previous sessions and perhaps have a new insight,\n-\nHighlight\nrecording a session gives the therapist the option to replay part of the session for clients.\n-\nHighlight\nYou should inform the client who will view the recordings, emphasizing that videotapes are considered confidential information.\n-\nHighlight\nrecordings are not kept permanently, but are regularly erased or recorded over.\n-\nHighlight\nClients should be asked to sign a form giving their consent for videotaping sessions. The form should\n-\nHighlight\noutline the purpose of the videotaping, who will view the recordings, and what will happen to the recordings after therapy is completed.\n-\nHighlight\nSome clients may be reluctant to be videotaped.\n-\nHighlight\nYou should carefully explore what is behind their reservations.\n-\nHighlight\nYou should pay careful attention to clients who are insistent about not being videotaped given they are the exception rather than the rule. These clients often have sensitive information that they wish to protect or keep secret.\n-\nHighlight\nIf therapy will include live supervision or the use of observing/ reflecting teams, discuss this with your clients.\n-\nHighlight\nhelpful to allow clients, at their request, to meet supervisors or team members who observe the sessions from behind the one-way mirror.\n-\nHighlight\nIt is difficult to assign a monetary value to therapy, and therapists often feel uneasy about charging fees while acting in a helping role. Therapist anxiety about fees can easily be transferred to clients and can create conflict and stress in therapy. Comfort in handling fees will increase with therapeutic experience and confidence in your ability to provide a worthwhile service.\n-\nHighlight\nThere is a business aspect of the therapy relationship and discussing fees should be handled in a business-like manner.\n-\nHighlight\nthe client is purchasing a service.\n-\nHighlight\nMost programs or clinicians establish a minimum fee and then work within a range.\n-\nHighlight\nou should discuss acceptable forms of payment, when the fee should be paid, and the fee for late cancellation or “no-show” appointments, if applicable.\n-\nHighlight\nuseful to have a written agreement that discusses the fees and policies regarding fees.\n-\nHighlight\nthird-party payers limit the number of sessions, or the types of presenting problems or diagnoses they will reimburse.\n-\nHighlight\nIf a third-party payer is involved, the therapist should verify insurance coverage at the outset of therapy. Issues that need to be addressed may include provider eligibility, annual deductibles, rate of reimbursement, limitations on the number of sessions, or types of treatments covered. Usually a DSM-5 diagnosis will need to be assigned to the insured patient.\n-\nHighlight\nAs with other administrative issues, working out the details for payment can be part of the diagnostic process and help to clarify the family’s expectations of and responsibilities for therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nGenerally, free services tend not to be valued by clients. A fee, even a small one, provides some incentive to make effective use of services. Paying a fee also indicates that the therapy has value to the client.\n-\nHighlight\ntherapists may be required to discuss with clients their professional qualifications.\n-\nHighlight\nMany agencies and practitioners have clients read and sign an informed consent statement that generally includes a brief description of what therapy is, including the potential risks, such as being asked to examine painful issues.\n-\nHighlight\ndefine clients’ expectations for what therapy will accomplish and how it will be conducted. This is essential to ensure that clients’ needs are compatible with what you, as the therapist, can or are willing to offer.\n-\nHighlight\nThe first step in defining expectations is to ask your clients what they would like to accomplish through therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nHow can I be helpful to you?” or “What are you hiring me to do?\n-\nHighlight\nClients hope that you will be able to fix these problems. Individuals will often say what they want to eliminate\n-\nHighlight\nand have a harder time articulating what they want\n-\nHighlight\nIf possible, encourage your clients to describe desired changes in positive language (what will be happening) rather than in negative language (what won’t be happening)\n-\nHighlight\nIt is important that each family member is given the opportunity to be heard when discussing problems and goals. This will help in joining with each individual.\n-\nHighlight\nyou may discover there is disagreement about the problem itself or who has the problem.\n-\nHighlight\nYou don’t want to anger the person who talks excessively, but if you fail to interrupt this behavior, other family members may lose faith in your ability to lead the session.\n-\nHighlight\nIn defining goals, a number of challenges can arise. Your clients may identify multiple problem areas, with little distinction of priorities.\n-\nHighlight\nyou will need to obtain your clients’ perspective on the relative importance of their problems.\n-\nHighlight\n“Of the issues you have presented, which is most important, and which is least important?”\n-\nHighlight\nyour clients may not have a clear idea of what the problem is or what their goals for therapy are.\n-\nHighlight\nmay need to contract for a limited number of sessions to explore and define problem areas and goals.\n-\nHighlight\nAnother potential problem is that clients may have unrealistically high expectations or goals.\n-\nHighlight\nSetting goals may be further complicated by the unstated agenda of a client, one that he or she feels is not appropriate to disclose.\n-\nHighlight\nSometimes, even the clients may not be totally aware of their reasons for seeking therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nAlternatively, individuals in couples or families may define goals that initially appear incompatible.\n-\nHighlight\nIn these situations, you may need to creatively reframe the goals in such a way as to make them compatible or link them together.\n-\nHighlight\nOnce you have a clear understanding of what your clients want or expect from therapy, you need to decide whether it is appropriate for you to take on the case.\n-\nHighlight\nyou must assess whether the case is within your scope of practice, that is, whether the clients are expecting help for issues that would be considered appropriate for a family therapist to treat.\n-\nHighlight\nThe scope of practice is defined for therapists by the laws that license or certify therapists in their state.\n-\nHighlight\nIf the case falls outside your scope of practice, you will need to refer your clients to an appropriate professional.\n-\nHighlight\nyou need to assess if the case falls within your scope of competence.\n-\nHighlight\ndo you have the necessary skills, training,\n-\nHighlight\nor experience to effectively treat the issues?\n-\nHighlight\nIf not, you need to refer the clients to another therapist who has the appropriate skills or qualifications.\n-\nHighlight\nyou may be able to treat clients provided you take appropriate measures during treatment to gain the necessary competence.\n-\nHighlight\ncould do a literature review on treating this condition and seek supervision on the case.\n-\nHighlight\nif you are working within an agency setting, you will need to evaluate if the services the clients are seeking fit within the agency’s scope of practice.\n-\nHighlight\nSome agencies specialize in addressing specific issues or problems, and may not want therapists working with clients who are seeking help for other concerns.\n-\nHighlight\nSeek consultation with your supervisor if these concerns arise, especially if there is any ambiguity around whether the issues fit under the agency’s scope of practice.\n-\nHighlight\nthere may be occasions where your clients’ needs are best met by working on other goals first before addressing the goals with which they initially present.\n-\nHighlight\nYou will need to present a rationale to your clients as to why a particular sequence of treatment will ultimately be in their best interest.\n-\nHighlight\nClient goals are often defined in terms of what problems or issues need to be resolved. In contrast, therapist goals generally reflect what changes clients need to make to resolve their problems. Client goals tell the therapist where they want to go, whereas therapist goals describe how the client will get there.\n-\nHighlight\nMany clients not only bring in expectations about what therapy will accomplish, but also about how therapy will be done.\n-\nHighlight\nhelpful to assess what clients expect therapy will be like.\n-\nHighlight\nWhenever a client has had previous therapy, it is often beneficial to explore what the experience was like, as it can strongly shape (both positively and negatively) a client’s expectations regarding therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nWhat did the client find most useful? What about the process didn’t work for him or her? More specific questions will generate a clearer picture of what occurred and how you might apply it to the current therapy situation.\n-\nHighlight\nthe therapist may need to educate clients about the therapy process\n-\nHighlight\nClients may hold expectations about therapy in a number of different areas.\n-\nHighlight\nYou need to assess if their expectations align with what you think is realistic.\n-\nHighlight\nClients can also have expectations about who will be in therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nIt is also important that the therapist and client share similar views on the purpose of therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nIf the therapist and client are not on the same page in this regard, then problems are likely to arise.\n-\nHighlight\nThe therapist and client will need to discuss what therapy is about and hopefully reach a mutually agreed-upon understanding.\n-\nHighlight\nIt is also possible that other client expectations may impede the therapeutic process.\n-\nHighlight\nIn some instances, you may decide against continuing therapy because the expectations are too restrictive and would severely limit your ability to be effective.\n-\nHighlight\nClients come to therapy with varying degrees of motivation.\n-\nHighlight\nThe initial interview is a good time to assess and perhaps begin to build motivation for therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nA logical time to assess motivation is when you are defining goals for therapy. Answers to the question “What brings you to therapy?” will differentiate motivated from unmotivated clients.\n-\nHighlight\nsome of these clients can become quite committed to therapy as they experience its benefits.\n-\nHighlight\nYou should also inquire as to who first suggested therapy or called for the appointment. Generally this person is the most motivated for therapy. A good question to ask your clients is what led them to come\n-\nHighlight\nto therapy now, rather than sooner or later in their lives?\n-\nHighlight\nWhere clients are on the Stages of Change Cycle\n-\nHighlight\nmay determine their motivation for change. This cycle recognizes that clients spend a great deal of time (precontemplation and contemplation stages) thinking about changing before they decide to take action and change. In addition, the cycle recognizes that maintaining changes,\n-\nHighlight\ncan be challenging. Thus, addressing relapse is part of the process leading to permanent change. The therapist must match his or her interventions to where the client is in terms of their stage of change.\n-\nHighlight\nMotivational interviewing\n-\nHighlight\nsuggests that the therapist’s job is to help the client resolve his or her ambivalence about change. Instead of using confrontation, the empathic therapist validates the client’s perspective and freedom to decide.\n-\nHighlight\nPain around unmet needs often drives clients to change.\n-\nHighlight\nit is important that you are clear on what the unmet needs are for your clients, and how much pain or distress they experience around these unmet needs\n-\nHighlight\nYou will need to figure out why the client is minimizing the problem, which will guide how you approach the situation.\n-\nHighlight\nit can helpful to explore with clients why others believe there is a problem and the possible negative consequences of not addressing it.\n-\nHighlight\nSometimes clients will deny that a problem exists out of fear of consequences or injury to their self-image.\n-\nHighlight\nTherefore, building motivation for therapy will need to be done in conjunction with addressing the client’s denial\n-\nHighlight\nIf a mandated client refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists, you can suggest that there is at least one problem—he or she is being told to come to unwanted therapy. If your client agrees (which is typically the case), then you can explore what needs to happen so that the client is no longer required to come to therapy. This approach allows you to join with your client, while at the same time working on intermediate goals that address the problem.\n-\nHighlight\nSome clients may have poor motivation because they do not anticipate any benefit from therapy, believing that therapy is useless or the situation is hopeless.\n-\nHighlight\nBuilding a positive expectation that therapy can be helpful will be vital for these clients\n-\nHighlight\nFor clients who lack confidence in their ability to change, you may need to highlight their strengths or help them challenge their negative self-talk. Noting exceptions to the problem might help build confidence and motivation.\n-\nHighlight\nUsing the above strategies does not guarantee client motivation.\n-\nHighlight\nIn these situations, you need to become comfortable with using the leverage for change provided by the courts.\n-\nHighlight\nA common struggle that beginning therapists may face is when they are more motivated than their clients.\n-\nHighlight\nThis dynamic suggests that the therapist needs to step back, review the reasons for therapy, and once again evaluate the clients’ motivation.\n-\nHighlight\nAt times, clients might seem motivated “for the wrong reasons.”\n-\nHighlight\nYou don’t need to agree with the clients’ motivations. Usually, it is enough that clients, for whatever reason, will face the demanding process of change.\n-\nHighlight\nkey issue that the beginning therapist must frequently deal with in the initial session: the issue of credibility.\n-\nHighlight\nIn order for clients to have hope or an expectation of change, they must see the therapist and therapy as credible, or they may prematurely terminate therapy.\n-\nHighlight\nassess early on if any issues of credibility need to be addressed.\n-\nHighlight\ndo the clients see therapy as an effective way to solve problems?\n-\nHighlight\ndo the clients see you, in your role as the therapist, as being competent or credible?\n-\nHighlight\nIf you suspect there is a credibility problem, you should attempt to pinpoint where and why credibility is lacking.\n-\nHighlight\nThe more precise your understanding of why the client does not see you or the therapy as credible, the more likely your intervention will be “on target” in addressing this issue.\n-\nHighlight\nIn cases where clients are resistant to therapy in general, you may be able to reframe the process in a way that builds its credibility.\n-\nHighlight\nyou must work to reduce the stigma. You can compare therapy to coaching, in that even the best athletes,\n-\nHighlight\nuse coaches.\n-\nHighlight\nWhen clients question a therapist’s credibility, they usually focus on the lack of professional or life experience. Often you can redefine for the client what type of experience is needed to be helpful.\n-\nHighlight\nIf you are concerned about your age and lack of experience, it may also be helpful to dress professionally and present in a professional manner.\n-\nHighlight\nyou may need to directly address with your clients how you will compensate for your lack of experience with a particular problem or population.\n-\nHighlight\nyou might express your willingness to learn from them about their culture.\n-\nHighlight\nWhile some clients are open to this approach, others will feel it is not their responsibility to educate the therapist about their culture.\n-\nHighlight\nEspecially for these clients, it will be important for you to take the initiative to educate yourself through reading the literature.\n-\nHighlight\nIf clients still harbor doubts, a frequently effective strategy is to contract with them for a set number of sessions (perhaps three). This gives you time to demonstrate your competence.\n-\nHighlight\nNearly all clients are willing to give you this chance, provided the number of sessions is reasonable.\n-\nHighlight\nIn these situations, you need to identify a problem that can be quickly resolved to build credibility with your clients.\n-\nHighlight\nIt is important that you not become defensive if your credibility is being questioned. If you can deal with your clients’ concerns in a nondefensive and respectful manner, this may actually build your credibility.\n-\nHighlight\nyou must be clear in your own mind what you do have to offer, even if you have limited clinical or life experience\n-\nHighlight\nyou need to recognize that clients value having someone compassionately and respectfully listen to their story at a difficult time in their lives.\n-\nHighlight\nIn simply being present with another human being, you have something important to offer your clients.\n-\nHighlight\nyou can frequently offer important insights to your clients because you do not have the kind of emotional involvement in the situation that they do.\n-\nHighlight\neven the inexperienced therapist has access to clinical knowledge that most clients do not possess or could not easily access.\n-\nHighlight\ninitial interview is a critical time\n-\nHighlight\nDeveloping a connection and establishing credibility with your clients is essential for their return for a second session. Defining goals and expectations for therapy, building motivation, and properly handling administrative issues are also crucial.\n-\nHighlight\nYou need to remain connected or joined with your clients in order to effectively confront and challenge them at all stages. Likewise, the goals or expectations for therapy may need to be revisited and redefined as therapy proceeds.\n- ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Annotations:","level":2,"id":"Annotations_0"},{"heading":"Chapter 1:","level":3,"id":"Chapter_1_0"},{"heading":"The Beginning Family Therapist (Taking on the Challenge)","level":4,"id":"The_Beginning_Family_Therapist_(Taking_on_the_Challenge)_0"},{"heading":"Getting Started","level":4,"id":"Getting_Started_0"},{"heading":"Managing Anxiety and Issues of Confidence","level":4,"id":"Managing_Anxiety_and_Issues_of_Confidence_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Stages of Therapist Development\" href=\"Stages of Therapist Development\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stages of Therapist Development</a>","level":4,"id":"[[Stages_of_Therapist_Development]]_0"},{"heading":"Stage One: Learning Essential Skills","level":4,"id":"Stage_One_Learning_Essential_Skills_0"},{"heading":"Step Two: Learning to Conceptualize Cases","level":4,"id":"Step_Two_Learning_to_Conceptualize_Cases_0"},{"heading":"Stage Three: The Therapist-as-Self","level":4,"id":"Stage_Three_The_Therapist-as-Self_0"},{"heading":"Obsessing about Clinical Work","level":5,"id":"Obsessing_about_Clinical_Work_0"},{"heading":"Dealing with Burnout","level":5,"id":"Dealing_with_Burnout_0"},{"heading":"Conclusion **:","level":3,"id":"Conclusion_**_0"},{"heading":"Chapter 2: Before the Initial Interview","level":2,"id":"Chapter_2_Before_the_Initial_Interview_0"},{"heading":"Dealing with Families Expectations and Anxieties about Therapy:","level":3,"id":"Dealing_with_Families_Expectations_and_Anxieties_about_Therapy_0"},{"heading":"Chapter 3: The Initial Interview:","level":2,"id":"Chapter_3_The_Initial_Interview_0"},{"heading":"Stages of the Initial Interview:","level":3,"id":"Stages_of_the_Initial_Interview_0"},{"heading":"First Stage (Introductions):","level":4,"id":"First_Stage_(Introductions)_0"},{"heading":"Second Stage (Administrative Issues):","level":4,"id":"Second_Stage_(Administrative_Issues)_0"},{"heading":"Third Stage (Goal-Setting):","level":4,"id":"Third_Stage_(Goal-Setting)_0"},{"heading":"Fourth Stage (Assessment Phase):","level":4,"id":"Fourth_Stage_(Assessment_Phase)_0"}],"links":["pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@pattersonessentialskillsfamily2018.html#_0","glossary/cft-keywords/stages-of-therapist-development.html","therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html#_0","glossary/cft-keywords/premature-termination-(pt).html"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@pattersonessentialskillsfamily2018.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1693014839038,"modifiedTime":1726670286943,"sourceSize":41562,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Pre-Practicum (8189.11)/Readings/@pattersonEssentialSkillsFamily2018.md","exportPath":"pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/@pattersonessentialskillsfamily2018.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"pre-practicum-(8189.11)/readings/sometimes-therapy-is-awkward-nicole-arzt.html":{"title":"Sometimes Therapy Is Awkward - Nicole Arzt","icon":"","description":"\nAs therapists, we know that reading is an integral part of our profession. A handful profoundly defined my identity as a therapist, but many of them felt dry, academic, and utterly disconnected from reality. If anything reading those books left me feeling even more insecure about my craft. Therapists have good intentions when they write books. But their message often becomes diluted - it becomes less about the nuances of personal development as a therapist and more about showcasing a series of their successes. Through my social media experience, I have gathered some basic assumptions about therapists: We often graduate from school feeling woefully unprepared.\nWe're scared we won't make any money. We (mostly) love the work we do.\nWe doubt ourselves constantly. We second-guess our career choice. We often feel unappreciated in the healthcare system. We're tired of subpar working conditions. We feel alone in our insecurities. We wonder if we're helping our clients. We have a dark sense of humor. We deserve to feel supported and empowered in this field. But we differ from our predecessors, and we need more books to reflect those differences. I see you. I am you. And I believe we need space for the messy and flawed and hopelessly insecure parts that can go along with doing this work. Myth: Successful therapists don't feel insecure. \"Your insecurities show you care. Nobody needs you to have all the answers. People need to know you care.\" Your insecurities show you care.\nAlmost all therapists doubt themselves. And they should. When we're humble, we're more empathic and understanding, and we don't assume we know all the answers. Instead, we remain open to learning and growing. Myth: Therapists are healthy and well-adjusted professionals. Paradoxically, we are attracted to pain. Likewise, while doing this work, we bring our stories, pains, and fears into each session. And through treating the problems of others, some therapists strategically avoid examining their own. We might be experts in mental health, but our expertise doesn't fix our own problems. Myth: Successful therapists always know what to do with their clients. Successful therapists don't always know what to do. Our clients rock our worlds, and our uncertainties reflect that. We can't always fit the hurt. It is impossible to always know the next move or intervention or phrase. We all struggle with immense doubt. Successful therapists learn to embrace it. Myth: Therapists give advice. Therapists help explore the barriers that lie between knowing and doing.\nOur job is to provide support and compassion. We support people in finding their conclusions about how they want to live their lives. We don't force them on to our preferred paths. Myth: Therapists don't make any real money. Myth: One credential is better than another credential. There probably is a best credential for you. Different credentials offer different levels of focus and expertise. Myth: Most clients are ready to change. Most clients want to change other people. They also want to change their circumstances. They want to wake up into their perfect lives, but not if achieving such perfection requires work. Clients do want to change. But many obstacles make that change incredibly challenging. Myth: Therapists make great partners, parents, and friends. Even when I try to model healthy communication or vulnerability, it doesn't mean others react positively. Therapists are humans. We get upset and flustered; we act irrationally, and we don't always think clearly. And because we give so much to our clients all day, we often have little to give to the rest of the world. Myth: Therapy must be face-to-face to be effective. American physicians performed lobotomies until 1967. Until 2010, American insurance companies could deny people healthcare coverage based on preexisting mental illness. We don't always know what we don't know. We only grow and get better with time. Therapy will evolve, and face-to-face therapy isn't the only answer. We must be open to new ways of helping. We may not agree with such changes, but we must promote diversity and flexibility in this profession. If we don't adapt, the career we love will die. Identify the Type of Insecure Therapist You Are: The Insecure Person: This therapist often: Struggles with an anxiety disorder.\nRequires ongoing reassurance and validation for their skills.\nQuestions their abilities while in session constantly.\nFantasizes about switching careers.\nFeels untethered in their sessions (they obsessively study new interventions or read new books or sign up for new training courses with the hopes of building more confidence). The Perfectionist: This therapist often: Believes they will fail at anything they try. Avoids taking risks or trying new things due to unwavering fear of failure. Wants to quantify abstract problems or solutions. Obsesses over policies, procedures and rules. Puts too much on their plate and typically overworks. Feels frustrated when clients don't succeed in predictable patterns. The Unresolved Life Shit Therapist: This therapist often: Struggles with remaining objective in sessions. Experiences intense and possibly uncontrollable countertransference. Stresses over their own mental health. Feels unable to maintain consistent and healthy boundaries with clients. The Straight-Up People Pleaser: This therapist often: Struggles or avoids confrontation with clients. Feels terrified and upset by aggressive clients. Dreads all forms of feedback. Feels paralyzed when faced with any semblance of conflict. Tiptoes around delicate issues in sessions or the workplace. Can You Be All of the Above?: You are just a human, and you have weaknesses. Now you're more aware of what they are and how they impact your work and your clients. So, how do you actually deal?\nGet Your Own Therapy. Therapy has never been an exact science. The heart of what we do entails an abstract human element. We can have all the knowledge and skills, but we can't remove the human parts of our work. Behind every successful therapist is another therapist supporting them. Therapy makes us better therapists, and it also makes us better people. Therapy allows us to explore both our personal and professional lives in one space. It offers a valuable opportunity for growth, self-awareness, and healing. We cannot fully support our clients without thoughtful insight into our own lives. Furthermore, how can we expect people to be honest and vulnerable with us if we never sit on the couch ourselves? But What If I've Already Tried Therapy, and It Didn't Work? Even when they know it's important, many therapists love to resist personal therapy, Usually, we fear exposing our vulnerabilities. Sharing weakness with another professional might reinforce our sense of incompetence. \"How do I find a therapist as a therapist?\" If you want the easy answer, I don't have it. There is no easy answer. Our profession does not make us inherently unique as people, it just makes us privy to how psychotherapy works. Learn to Accept Distraction: Ironic Process Theory: When we try to suppress a though, another part of our brain checks in to ensure we're not thinking about it. Yet, this brain activity triggers us to think about it more. Intrusive thoughts happen all the time. Distraction is inevitable. It is how we deal with it that matters. Learn How to Move Back to the Present Moment: Accept the thoughts instead of resisting them. Pretend someone else is watching you. Make it a personal mission to move away from your boredom. Four pathways to reignite your interest: Acknowledge our distraction to the client. When we admit to our own shortcomings, we model being human to our clients. Pivot the conversation. Address our emotions. Pretend you are your client. You don't need to master working with one population right away (or ever). Keep an open mind during your training years. Get exposure. Learn new ways of doing things. Many therapists stumble into a population or theory without seeking it out. Stay curious about what you don't know. Learn to accept unconventional and nonlinear progress. Before we even attempt to measure progress, we must identify the obstacles that make measurements challenging. Here are some considerations: Obstacle 1: Clients lie (Both intentionally and unintentionally) “Our clients lie to us for many reasons. First, they want us to like them. Many clients fantasize about being our favorite client. They present well because they want us to feel proud and impressed by them. Often, they’ve had countless experiences related to feeling like they’ve let other people down. Their efforts to please emerge from the transference they experience toward us.”\n“Sometimes, clients lie because they know our positions of authority and power, particularly when it comes to mandated reporting. They avoid disclosing sensitive material related to issues like suicidal thoughts or child abuse. They worry the truth will get them into trouble.”\n“Clients also lie because they want to test us. Sometimes, they want to determine what we remember and what we forget. Are we really a safe person? Are we truly trustworthy? Can we actually hold the pain we promise we can hold? Most lies come from a place of hopeful truth.”\nThe very best lies often sound like the very best truths. Obstacle 2: Trust can take a very long time. We can't just turn on trust like it's a light switch. We have to foster it in every interaction we have with our clients. Obstacle 3: Progress in One Area Can Reveal Flaws Somewhere Else. Improvements in one concentrated area can have the effect of improvement in other areas. For new therapists, this reality may feel discouraging, and that's because it can be. After all, many clients come to us desperately wanting to change in their lives. Obstacle 4: The Client's Goal Isn't Always the Best Goal. Therapists working with acute, high-risk populations (substance use disorders, eating disorders, complex trauma, psychotic disorders) see this discrepancy all the time. They know about denial and minimization and intellectualization. As therapists, it's important that we recognize the hierarchy of treatment needs. Identifying and treating certain issues must precede others. However, a mismatch in priorities can certainly impact progress, and it can also create issues within the therapeutic relationship itself. After all, we aren't supposed to have an agenda. We are, however, supposed to keep our clients safe. At times, these issues can and will intersect. Obstacle 5: We Rarely Receive Productive Feedback. Nobody sees us in the therapy room. Our colleagues, supervisors, or spouses can't watch us perform. Although we discuss cases, we don't receive accurate feedback about our skills, because nobody truly knows what we're saying or doing. This lack of feedback makes measuring progress difficult. Most clients won't provide us with direct feedback. We are not allowed to solicit testimonials. This dynamic leaves us in a vulnerable position. We rely on clients to be honest about their feelings towards us. At the same time, we must straddle the reality of knowing that most clients avoid confrontation, want to please us, and blame themselves if and when things go wrong in therapy. Obstacle 6: Things Get Worse Before They Get Better. Therapists struggle when they watch their clients struggle. First, we care about their well-being. Additionally, we often assume that a happy client indicates that we are doing our job successfully. But we can't just measure progress by a client's level of happiness. In fact, happiness isn't always measurable or achievable. Sometimes, we must measure progress based on other factors like increased self-awareness or strengthening boundaries or changing negative behaviors. We must remember that our clients may remain in the 'getting worse' phase even after they leave treatment. This phenomenon is common when we don't control the termination. Remember that books don't always tell the truth. Because even when therapists try to educate their readers and showcase their weaknesses, they inevitably brag about their brilliance. All successful writing needs to be engaging, compelling, and crafted to appeal to a target demographic. Talented writers may know how to write about therapy more than they know how to conduct therapy. Just be mindful that even master therapists aren't perfect all the time. A good writer isn't always a good therapist. Understand that you'll never be the right age. We will never be the 'perfect age' to be therapists. No matter our ages, some clients will benefit from it, and others will have a problem with it. We invariably hold biases about age, but we hold biases about everything. Our clients make automatic assumptions based on every detail we provide them. And since we don't offer our clients much, they base their judgements on whatever is accessible. Regardless of the accuracy, the assumptions connect dots and illustrate a picture of who we are. Clients don't want us to be blank templates. They want to know we are human, and they will latch on to any shred of human evidence they can find from us. My best advice is to lean into this narrative. Your age is yours. While it doesn't define you, it is a fixed part of you. Don't forget that you are going to die. I recommend you imagine yoruself on your deathbed. Scan through all the past and current events, people, and places in your life. Don't spend too long in the space. Then visualize yourself drifting into death, settling into the depths of the darkest night. It's about reminding ourselves that life is incredibly short and precious. We don't need to have 'perfect therapist' etched on our headstones. We are going to die, and life is so much more than the sum of our careers. We are all going to die. But before we do that, we need to learn how to live. Know the limits of graduate school. Graduate school teaches the foundational principles of psychotherapy. We learn the laws and ethics, and we receive bite-size samples of theory, interventions, and psychoeducation. But until we do therapy, we really have no way of knowing what therapy feels like. School teaches us the logic of the work, but only experience teaches us the emotion of it. Understand your relationships can, will, and should evolve. In becoming therapists, we learn about the nitty-gritty patterns of human behavior. Simultaneously, by understanding these patterns, we engage in a deep and rigorous self-analysis. We have no choice but to also look inward, to examine how we operate in the world. And while this soul-searching offers tantalizing insight, all self-awareness has the potential to be painful. However, if you value emotional wellness and personal growth, the pain is a necessary part of the process. Cultivate a connection with a professor or supervisor. Professors and supervisors also hold power. They can dramatically affect your sucess in terms of internships, scholarships, or long-term career options. We all benefit from having someone who can vouch for us. Ideally, this person will: Write an excellent letter of recommendation if needed. Act as a reference when applying for internships or jobs. Provide appropriate and helpful guidance. If you are a new therapist, start thinking about this goal immediately. Make yourself memorable. Ask questions. Attend office hours. Be active and engaged in conversation, and show up ready to work and learn. Master time management. Audit how you spend every working hour for one week. Make red, yellow, and green to do lists. The reds are the most imminent and nonnegotiable tasks. They have to get done, so I prioritize them first. Yellows are important, but they are less time-sensitive and critical than the reds. I move to yellows only after I complete the red tasks. I reserve greens for last. Some days, I get to them. Most days, I don't. Ban distractions. We crave distraction. Although most of us complain about our procrastination habits, we forget that procrastination is also fun. The best way for me to ban distractions is by prohibiting them during my red tasks. I also build in ten-minute breaks every thirty minutes. This permits me to work in longer chunks without completely draining my energy. Remember that motivation is optional, but discipline is necessary. Motivation is fickle because it's a feeling. Feelings, as we know, are fleeting. Discipline, on the other hand, is an action. We can discipline ourselves regardless of our feelings. Many people who struggle with discipline also struggle with poor time management. That's because they wait to feel motivated to discipline themselves. Stop waiting. Start doing. Take care of your finances. Financial insecurity impacts our personal lives. But it also creates an insidious ripple effect in our professional endeavors.\nYour financial health is part of your well-being, and today's stressors can become tomorrow's emergencies. If you're neglecting this part of your life, take the time to identify small changes you can make today. Focus on being a growth-oriented therapist. Training therapists should recognize they are learning, and that they don't need to know everything. They need to work hard, but they're allowed to have limitations. The goal is not having all the experience or knowledge. The goal is to have ongoing movement toward growth. This is a value that can and should continue throughout one's professional career. Growth-Oriented Therapists: Ask difficult questions to clients (even if they feel uncomfortable and provocative).\nPresents mistakes, weaknesses, and concerns to their supervisor, with the intention to learn from them. They are active in supervision, and they offer practical suggestions and feedback to their colleagues. Focus on client growth instead of client approval. They address pain and confront clients when appropriate. Walk into the session with a sense of purpose and the mindset of practicing their skills. They feel a sense of control over the session. Use conceptualization skills to interpret the client's overall presentation. They consider what is being said, but they also consider what might be omitted. Understand the overall fluidity of therapy. They recognize that growth occurs mostly outside of sessions and that therapy is the catalyst for change (and not the change itself).\nHave insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. They feel motivated to work on weaknesses and readily accept feedback in doing so. Understand that therapy often has unknown outcomes. They conceptualize how clients might react, but they aren't tethered to this expectation. Stagnant Therapists: Maintain surface-level conversation and often play it safe in dialogue with clients.\nSugarcoat or downplay issues in sessions. They tend to focus only on what is going well. They share minimally in supervision, as they don't want to be judged by their supervisor or colleagues. Struggle to accept hardships within the therapeutic relationship. They often hold back in confronting clients. Walk into the session feeling scattered. They're at the mercy of whatever the client brings that day, and they often lose focus. Lack conceptualization skills. They take client content and disclosures at face value, and they become distracted or overwhelmed by content details presented in session. View sessions as separate entities. They judge sessions as 'good' or 'bad' based on variables like if a client made a significant breakthrough or responded well to a particular intervention. May have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. But, they feel paralyzed or doomed by their weaknesses and may become defensive over them.\nWant controllable outcomes. They either avoid conceptualization altogether or they expect themselves to know what exactly what to do. Your training status isn't a secret. If you are a trainee, intern, or associate, you have already disclosed your status to clients. You are under supervision, and you work under someone else's license. Subsequently, nobody expects you to be an expert. But too many therapists fear making mistakes. I understand it is challenging to discern which risks are appropriate to take. Nobody wants to cause irreversible harm to their clients. But that's why we have supervision and training. That's why we work under someone else. This is your time to experiment and grow - you'll never have such ample opportunity again. Remember, your career is more than a calling. We must remember that we are healthcare professionals and trained experts in treating mental illness. We spend significant money and time to cultivate our craft. At times, we save lives. Our work matters. Let's rise to that. Accept all the anxieties. With time and experience, we gain confidence in ourselves and in our skills. Although the anxiety often feels paralyzing at first, you must trust that it eventually subsides. I found comfort knowing everyone else felt equally terrified. Accept that those negative thoughts will arise. Accept that they don't indicate your truth. As therapists, we help people move through their fears in almost every session. It only makes sense that we learn this skill ourselves. Practive letting go of controlling the room.

The information creating these differences is transmitted across generations through relationships. The transmission occurs in several interconnected levels, ranging from the conscious teaching and learning of information to the automatic and unconscious programming of emotional reactions and behaviors. Relationally and genetically transmitted information interact to shape an individual's 'self.' The combination of parents actively shaping the development of their offspring, offspring inately responding to their parents' moods, attitudes, and actions, and the long dependency period of human offspring results in people's developing levels of differentiation of self similar to their parents'. However, the relationship patterns of nuclear family emotional systems often result in at least one member of a sibling group developing a little more 'self' and another member developing a little less 'self' than the parents. People predictably select mates with levels of differentiation of self that match their own. Therefore, if one offspring's level of 'self' is higher than the parents' and another is lower, one offspring's marriage is more differentiated and the other's marriage is less differentiated than the parents' marriage. If each offspring then has a child who is more differentiated and a child who is less differentiated than himself, one three generational line becomes progressively more differentiated (the most differentiated child of the most differentiated offspring) and one line becomes progressively less differentiated (the least differentiated child of the least differentiated offspring). As these processes repeat over multiple generations, the differences between family lines grow increasingly marked. Levels of differntiation of self can affect longevity, marital stability, reproduction, health, educational accomplishments, and occupational successes. This impact of differentiation on overall life functioning explains the marked variation that typically exists in the lives of the members of a multigenerational family. The highly differentiated people have unusually stable nuclear families and contribute much to society. The poorly differentiated people have chaotic personal lives and depend heavily on others to sustain them. A key implication of the multigenerational concept is that the roots of the most severe human problems, as well as of the highest levels of human adaptation, are generations deep. The multigenerational transmission process not only programs the levels of 'self' people develop but also how people interact with others. Both types of programming affect the selection of a spouse For example, if a family programs someone to atta ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["research-citations/books/@nicholsfamilytherapyconcepts2019.html","therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/multigenerational-transmission-process.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1699833403714,"modifiedTime":1742983346162,"sourceSize":3291,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Bowen Family System Theory/Key Terms and Concepts/Multigenerational Transmission Process.md","exportPath":"therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/multigenerational-transmission-process.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html":{"title":"Murray Bowen","icon":"","description":"\nMurray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia Emphasized theory\nBowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children.

It aims to introduce this influential approach and a sample of developments in theory and practice since Bowen's first publications of his research and theory. This paper is the second edition of a 1999 article with the same title (Brown, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy, 20, 94 and 1999) and, 25 years later, offers new insights from the original author's ongoing research into the theory. This new edition is in collaboration with a second author and Bowen theory scholar, bringing fresh perspectives on the theory's applicability to family therapy practice. The core concepts are presented briefly, and a case example with a parent and symptomatic adolescent demonstrates how theory informs the role of the therapist and the therapeutic work. Examples of criticisms of Bowen theory are also discussed, including the misinterpretation around the idea of emotion in Bowen theory that is communicated in Gottman's training. Differentiation of self is clarified as the integration of emotion and intellect rather than privileging one over another, which affords the opportunity for individuals to avoid being governed by the invisible strings of sensitivities in relationships and instead be themselves in good emotional contact with the other person.\nKeywords: <a href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io?query=tag:Differentiation\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Differentiation\">#Differentiation</a> Families have resources for natural adaptation to life's challenges that are explored in therapy and are a foundational part of the family's understanding of itself and its capacity to make change. The eight concepts of theory shape clinical work that tracks emotional processes in relationships and creates the opportunity for recovery and growth. Important criticisms of the theory about culture and gender relevance, the dangers of neutralizing family violence and the use of emotion in therapy are discussed. Seeing the theory applied to a case with symptoms in a child reveals the centrality of observing emotional processes. <br><a data-href=\"Murray Bowen\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Murray Bowen</a> 's <a data-href=\"Family Systems Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Systems Theory</a>, or 'Bowen Theory,' was one of the first comprehensive theories that described how family systems functioned.

He trained as a psychiatrist and originally practiced within the psychoanalytical model. At the Menninger Clinic in the late 1940 s, he had started to involve mothers in the investigation and treatment of schizophrenic patients. His devotion to his psychoanalytic training was set aside by the time he moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1954. He was committed to psychiatry becoming an accepted science and found fodder for this in natural systems and evolution. His groundbreaking research with NIMG enabled him and his research team to observe whole families in a residential treatment setting, where he began to include more family members in his research and psychotherapy with schizophrenic patients. This consolidated the shift from an individual and mother-child dyad focus to an appreciation of the dimensions of families as emotional systems. In 1959, he moved to Georgetown University and established the Georgetown Family Center (where he was director until his death). Here, his developing theory was extended to less severe emotional problems. Between 1959 and 1962, he undertook detailed research into families across several generations. Rather than developing a theory about pathology, Bowen focused on what he saw as the common patterns of all 'human emotional systems.' With such a focus on the qualitative similarities of all families, Bowen was known to say frequently, \"There is a little schizophrenia in all of us.\" In 1966, Bowen published the first 'orderly presentation' of his developing ideas. In 1967, he surprised a national family therapy conference by discussing his family experience rather than presenting the anticipated formal paper. Bowen proceeded to encourage students to work on researching facts from their own multigenerational families of origin rather than undertaking individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy (a prominent training method of that time). The effort in one's own family is to better understand the individual self in the context of previous generational challenges, adaptations, and variations in family members' functioning. The interest in evolutionary process distinguishes Bowen from other family therapy pioneers. He placed his earlier study of Freudian theory with 'a study of the rich body of facts that can be proven and validated' in evolution and the natural sciences. Bowen writes: \"I support the view that the human is as scientific as the other forms of life on the planet, that it will finally be possible to construct a total human theory from scientific facts alone.\" (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 360) Bowen was committed to his research and theory being embedded in science with the aim of developing a theory that accounted for the entire range of human behavior and its origins. Bowen focused on mechanisms/patterns that develop in families to adapt to challenges and defuse anxiety. Anxiety is presented as either acute, in that it is a response to an actual adverse event, or chronic, in that the stress response is sustained beyond factual threats.\nA key generator of anxiety in families is the alertness to either too much closeness (togetherness force) or too great a distance (separateness force) in a relationship. \"The theory postulates two opposing elemental life forces. One is built-in life growth force toward individuality and the differentiation of a separate 'self,' and the other an equally intense emotional closeness.\" While essential for human family survival, both forces are the source of tensions in relationships with family members, always shifting their pull for more connection or increased space and autonomy. <br>The degree of tension in any one family will be determined by the current levels of external stress and the sensitivities to particular themes transmitted down the generations and heightened or lowered levels of sensitivity related to levels of family emotional maturity or the degree of <a data-href=\"Differentiation of Self\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Differentiation of Self</a>. If family members do not have the capacity to think through their responses to relationship dilemmas but instead continue to react anxiously to perceived emotional demands, a state of chronic anxiety or sustained reactivity may be set in place. Bowen defined eight interlocking concepts that make up his theory: <br><a data-href=\"Differentiation of Self\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Differentiation of Self</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Triangles\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/triangles.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Triangles</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Nuclear Family Emotional Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nuclear Family Emotional Process</a> Couple Conflict\nSymptoms in a spouse\nSymptoms in a child <br><a data-href=\"Family Projection Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/family-projection-process.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Projection Process</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Emotional Cutoff\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-cutoff.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Emotional Cutoff</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Multigenerational Transmission Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/multigenerational-transmission-process.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Multigenerational Transmission Process</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Sibling Positions\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sibling Positions</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Societal Emotional Process\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Societal Emotional Process</a> Differentiation of self is the capacity to stay connected while also holding onto autonomous thinking and goal direction. It is twofold in that it has an intrapsychic expressing in integrating both thinking and feelings and an interpersonal component of maintaining a separate self while connected to a relationship. Viewed as a continuum from low to high Bowen articulates that, \"A person with a high level of 'differentiation of self,' or 'identity,' or 'individuality,' is one who can be emotionally close to others without emotional fusions or loss of self, or loss of identity.\" (Bowen, 1978, p. 109)\nIn the same way that differentiation has both an intrapsychic and interpersonal component, fusion can be expressed either as a merging of feelings and thinking for an individual or a relational intense sensitivity to another's reactions, which leads to people giving up on their own ideas or values for the sake of the relationship going smoothly. Varying degrees of fusion are discernible in all families. A person in a fused relationship reacts immediately (as if with a reflex, knee-jerk response) to the perceived demands of another person without being able to think through the choices or talk over relationship matters directly with the other person. Energy is invested in taking things personally (ensuring the emotional comfort of another) or in distancing oneself (ensuring one's own). The greater a family's tendency to fuse, the less flexibility it will have in adapting to stress. Bowen developed the idea of a hypothetical 'differentiation of self scale' to assist in conveying the continuum aspect of this concept. He points out that this was not designed as an instrument to assign people to particular levels. Bowen maintains that the speculative nature of estimating a level of differentiation is compounded by factors usch as stress levels, individual differences in reactivity to different stressors and the degree of contact individuals have with their extended family. Bowen acknowledged that an effort to increase differentiation is a lifelong process. The goal is to observe the self on the spectrum to enhance awareness and improve functioning in small steps. One example of gradual steps is the effort to establish a more neutral personal relationship with each parent. \"Achieving a person-to-person relationship with either parent is a major undertaking, but, if the differentiating person is aware that the result is highly desireable and of great potential benefit to self, [they have] a long-term assignment at which they can work constantly in their own way.\" (Bowen, 1978, p. 236) The scale of differentiation conveys that the theory is about a continuum of levels of functioning and not a theory that categorizes or pathologizes people. The goal is to observe self on this spectrum and increase functioning just a bit, leading to a similar lift in the functioning of the whole family. Bowen described triangles as the smallest stable relationship unit (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 135) because it is difficult to contain the emotional forces in a two-person relationship. Triangling is said to occur when the inevitable discomfort in a dyad is relieved by involving a third party who either takes sides or provides a detour for anxiety. Under calm conditions, it is difficult to identify triangles, but like all mechanisms to manage anxiety, they emerge more frequently and more intensely under stress. Triangles are linked closely with Bowen's concept of differentiation in that the greater the degree of fusion in a relationship, the more heightened the pull to preserve emotional stability by forming a triangle. The process of conflict, distance and over- and underfunctioning also feature as part of the Triangling patterns in relationships. This process is not dysfunction but can become problematic when a third party's involvement distracts the members of a dyad from resolving their relationship impasse. If a third party is drawn in, the focus shifts to criticizing or worrying about the new outsider, preventing the original complainants from resolving their tension. This detouring helps people steady themselves without working on growing their maturity. In positing the 'nuclear family emotional system,' Bowen 'describes the patterns of emotional functioning in a family in a single generation' (Bowen 1978, p. 376) Observable patterns in families for managing the anxieties inherent in a family's undifferentiation. These patterns are repeated over the generations: Certain basic patterns between the father, mother, and children are replicas of the past generations and will be repeated in the generations to follow. (Bowen, 1978, p. 376) Fusion that both preserves harmony and generates tension is present in varying degrees in all families, who will predictably utilize the following patterns to manage levels of discomfort. These tension management mechanisms are: Couple conflict and distance\nDistance\nSymptoms/illness in a spouse (over and underfunctioning reciprocity)\nProjection of a problem onto one or more children The single-generation unit usually starts with a dyad - a couple who, according to Bowen, will be at approximately equal levels of differentiation (i.e., both have the same degree of need to be stabilized and validated through the relationship).\nPermission to disagree is one of the most important contracts between individuals in an intimate relationship. In a fused relationship, partners interpret the emotional state of the other as their responsibility and the other; s stated disagreement as a personal affront to them. Conflict only becomes problematic when it is chronically sustained by emotional reactivity. (this is what we see in the clinic with couples who have been together for years and are coming in for couples therapy) A typical pattern in emotionally intense relationships is a cycle of closeness followed by conflict to create distance, which in turn is followed by the couple making up and resuming the intense closeness. This pattern is termed a 'conflictual cocoon,' (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 192) where anxiety is bound within the conflict cycle without spilling over to involve children. Distancing is not just inherent in patterns of marital conflict but a broader way of avoiding emotional tension that is part of triangling a child and over- and underfunctioning of spouses. It is one of the most instinctive ways humans reduce discomfort in a relationship by withdrawing emotionally or physically. Kerr describes, \"An example of emotional distancing is people being in physical proximity but avoiding emotionally charged topics. The anxiety is bound in the avoiding of such topics.\" In a fused relationship, where each partner looks to the other's qualities to fit their own learned manner of relating to significant others, a pattern of reciprocity can be set in motion that pushes each spouse's functioning to opposite extremes. Both are equally undifferentiated in that they define themselves according to the reactions of the other. The spouse who makes the most adjustments in the self in order to preserve relationship harmony is said by Bowen to be prone to developing symptoms. \"The one who functions for long periods in the adaptive [underfunctioning] position gradually loses the ability to function and make decisions for self. At that point, it requires no more than a moderate increase in stress to trigger the adaptive one into dysfunction.\" (Bowen, 1978, p. 378)

When they first began working with families, behavior therapists applied learning theory to train parents in behavior modification and teach communication skills to couples. <br>The early principles of behavior therapy were developed by two key figures: <a data-href=\"Joseph Wolpe\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/joseph-wolpe.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Joseph Wolpe</a> and <a data-href=\"B.

F. Skinner</a>. In 1948, Wolpe introduced systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization deconditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition by pairing responses incompatible with anxiety to previously anxiety-arousing stimuli. <br>Skinner's <a data-href=\"Operant Conditioning\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/operant-conditioning.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Operant Conditioning</a>: Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.\nThe operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change. <br><a data-href=\"Shaping\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shaping</a>: Skills taught in sequence. Teach parents to reinforce prosocial behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts. This process also promotes positive relationships between parents and children. Children earn rewards while they learn prosocial skills, and in the process, their self-esteem grows with their success and their parents' positive attention. <br><a data-href=\"Gerald Patterson\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/gerald-patterson.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gerald Patterson</a>: Took the lead in introducing disciplinary techniques, such as time-out, because he discovered that ignoring the problem behavior is not always sufficient, especially with aggressive children. During the 1970s, behavioral and emotional responses, along with the interpersonal transactions that occur within their family, social, vocational, political, and culture networks. <br><a data-href=\"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a>: Refers to those approaches inspired by the work of Albert Ellis (1962) and Aaron Beck (1976) that emphasize the need for attitude change to promote behavior modification. According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania. The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. <br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href=\"Social Exchange Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy. Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. <br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href=\"Schemas\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone. Hidden assumptions have a potent impact on how people perceive and react to each other. <br><a data-href=\"Behavior Exchange Theory\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/behavior-exchange-theory.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Behavior Exchange Theory</a>: A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control. A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills. Neil Jacobson (1981): Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. Attention is a powerful social reinforcer. The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)\nEven when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.\nOthers persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. <br>The use of <a data-href=\"Aversion Control\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills. Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease') Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. <br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up. These schemas are the basis of biased assumptions that poison relationships by distorting family members' responses to each other. The following are typical <a data-href=\"Cognitive Distortions\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-distortions.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cognitive Distortions</a> cognitive distortions: <br><a data-href=\"Arbitrary Inference\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/arbitrary-inference.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Arbitrary Inference</a>: Conclusions are draw in the absence of supporting evidence.

The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out. <br><a data-href=\"Shaping\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shaping</a>: Consists of reinforcing change in small steps. <br><a data-href=\"Token Economy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/token-economy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Token Economy</a>: Use points to reward children for good behavior. <br><a data-href=\"Contingency Contracting\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-contracting.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Contingency Contracting</a>: Agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their children. <br><a data-href=\"Contingency Management\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-management.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Contingency Management</a>: Giving and taking away rewards based on children's behavior. <br><a data-href=\"Time-Out\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Time-Out</a>: Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior. S for stimulus\nO for the state of the organism\nR for the target response\nKC for the contingency of consequences Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. <br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href=\"Premack Principle\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Premack Principle</a> is applied. High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. <br><a data-href=\"Time-Out\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting. Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.\nCase Study: Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind. The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession. The most widely used in the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale, a 23-item questionnaire covering various aspects of marital satisfaction, including communication, sex, affection, social activities, and values. Assessments are designed to reveal strengths and weaknesses of a couple's relationship and the manner in which rewards and punishments are exchanged. Interviews and questionnaires are used to specify and elaborate target behaviors. Jacobson's (1981) Pretreatment Assessment for Marital Therapy: Strengths and skills of the relationship: What are the major strengths of this relationship?\nWhat behaviors on the part of each spouse are highly valued by the other?\nWhat shared activities does the couple currently engage in? Presenting Problems: What are the major complaints, and how do these complaints translate into explicit behavioral terms?\nWhat are the reinforcers maintaining these behaviors?\nWhat behaviors occur at less than the desired frequency or fail to occur at appropriate times from the standpoint of each spouse?\nWhat are the consequences of these behaviors currently, when they occur? Sex and Affection: Is either spouse currently dissatisfied with rate, quality, or diversity of sex life together?\nIf sex is currently a problem, was there a time when it was mutually satisfying?\nWhat are the sexual behaviors that seem to be associated with current dissatisfaction?\nAre either or both partners dissatisfied with the amount or quality of nonsexual physical affection? Future Prospects: Are the partners seeking therapy to improve their relationship, to separate, or to decide whether the relationship is worth working on?\nWhat are each spouse's reasons for continuing the relationship despite the current problems? Assessment of Social Environment: What are each person's alternatives to the present relationship?\nHow attractive are these alternatives to each person?\nIs the environment (parents, relatives, friends, work associates, children) supportive of either continuance or dissolution of present relationship? Individual Functioning of Each Spouse: Does either spouse exhibit emotional or behavioral problems?\nHave they been in therapy before, either alone or together? What kind of therapy? Outcome?\nWhat is each spouse's past experience with intimate relationships?\nHow is the present relationship difference? Richard Stuart (1975) lists five strategies that summarize the behavioral approach to troubled marriages: Couples are taught to express themselves in a clear, behavior descriptions rather than in vague complaints.\nCouples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. Couples are helped to improve their communication. Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations. Treatment that emphasizes attitude change as well as reinforcement of behavior.

Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered.\nIdentify behavioral goals.\nLearn techniques to achieve these goals.\nFacilitate social reinforcement of change. A hallmark of behavioral therapy.\nFamilies and couples - questionnaires and home observations are conducted. For sex therapy, clinical interviews are the main assessment tool. Treatment goals are set based on results of assessment.\n2-4 sessions (About 1.5-2 hours each) Main Point: To gather information as much as possible at the beginning to form treatment plan.\nEach person takes turn to respond. Gather information, perspective-taking and avoid escalation. Information Gathering: Self-report questionnaires, clinical interviews, observation of interactional patterns. Initial Conjoint Interviews (Couple): CBCT: How the couple met, what attracted them to each other, how they developed a deeper involvement, positive and negative life events, prior experiences in therapy. Initial Conjoint Interviews (Families): Inquired about the family members' current concerns and strengths of the relationship.\nOrients the family to the process of therapy by describing the structure and course of CBFT and the roles of therapist and family. Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment, and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals.\nTherapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy.\nExtinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words. Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of. The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback The agenda of therapy is educational. Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation. Didactic role early on to strike a balance between directiveness and collaboration.\nReviews homework assignments, models skills, coaches family members in practicing them, and fosters motivation.\nBalances alliances and interventions with all the family members or subsystems, so that they feel supported and remain equally invested in improving relationships. Directive Role of the Therapist: Sets the pace of sessions so that the goals of treatment are addressed in a timely and sequential fashion. Sets the agenda each session.\nMonitors the use of time.\nResponsible to stay on task and address the goals of session.\nTeaches the clients to self-monitor as well. Maintains control of the session with confidence and credibility.\nAssumes multiple roles: Director, educator, facilitator, collaborator, advocate Balances the alliance and interventions with all members, so they feel supported and invested. Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions.\nHomework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interaction patterns with new ones, families need to rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.' Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints.\nCouples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement.\nCouples are helped to improve their communication.\nCouples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making.\nCouples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. Imagery\nRoleplay\nCoaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)\nCommunication training: For example, engaging in an argument without attacking, 'I-statements', and Speaker/Listener exercises Problem-solving training\nHomework Assignments\nMindfulness and Meditation Parents have control over the rewards and punishment of children. If parents change the contingencies of reinforcement, the child's behavior will change. Skills are taught in sequence (shaping).\nHelp parents define the child's positive and problematic behaviors in specific observable actions.\nTracking target behaviors.\nReinforcing desired behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts.\nDisciplinary techniques include time out, ignoring problem behavior. Observe/Assess the frequency of problem behavior, what precedes it, and what reinforcement follows (Behavior Chaining)\nShaping (reinforcing small steps toward change)\nToken economies (reward good behavior)\nContingency contracting (agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their child)\nTime out\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Resources:","level":4,"id":"Resources_0"},{"heading":"Background:","level":3,"id":"Background_0"},{"heading":"Leading Figures:","level":3,"id":"Leading_Figures_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Ivan Pavlov\" href=\"Ivan Pavlov\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ivan Pavlov</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Ivan_Pavlov]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"Joseph Wolphe\" href=\"Joseph Wolphe\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Joseph Wolphe</a>:","level":4,"id":"[[Joseph_Wolphe]]_0"},{"heading":"<a data-href=\"B.

Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS? The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings.

Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways: The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another.

Remember that humor and love are two very powerful healing forces. This lets you know how you sense yourself. What is the physical condition of your sense organs? What freedoms do you give yourself to look, hear, touch, taste, and smell?\nMany of us were taught that we could only look at, touch, or listen to certain things. That often resulted in limiting our use of our senses. To acknowledge, honor, and fully and freely use our senses is the main way we interact with the outside world and stimulate ourselves internally. This is that of your emotions, your feelings. How free are you to recognize and acknowledge them? What restrictions do you put on your feelings? How do you express them?\nAll feelings are human. They bring texture, color, and sensitivity to life. Without feelings, we would be robots. Your feelings about these feelings show you where your self-worth is in relation to your feelings. This is the cognitive part of your brain. This lens tells you about the information you take in, the thoughts you have, and the meaning you give them. From this cognitive and rational part, you can get answers to such questions as, \"What do I understand? How do I learn new things? How do I analyze situations and solve problems?\" This is the physical body with all its parts and systems.\nFind a good anatomy book in which you can see pictures of your bones, muscles, internal organs, together with all the different systems. Let yourself be awed and amazed at how wonderfully your body is engineered and what a treasure house of resources it contains. Apply this information to your own body. Are you, its owner, meeting its needs? Are you listening to it? It will tell you when you are tired, hungry, or over-stressed, or alert you to any part of you that needs special care.

These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.\nAt any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance.

protect their self-worth. The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive. Privileges self and context while discounting the other. To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.\nTheir experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. Assert their needs and desires while minimizing those of others. You will find placator and blamer married in therapy because their stances are complimentary. Your job as a therapist is to help blamer to learn how to acknowledge and develop empathy for the thoughts and needs of others.

The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.\nWith these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship.

The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context.

This is a 'yes man' who talks as though they could do nothing for themselves; they must always get someone's approval. They may experience feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit during conflict or disagreement. You may think of yourself as really worth nothing. You are lucky just to be allowed to eat. You owe everybody gratitude, and you really are responsible for everything that goes wrong. Naturally, you will agree with any criticism of you. You are grateful that anyone even talks to you, no matter what they say or how they say it. You would not think of asking anything for yourself. After all, who are you to ask? Besides, if you can just be good enough, it will come by itself. Think of yourself as being physically down on one knee, wobbling a bit, and putting out one hand in a begging fashion. Keep your head up so your neck will hurt, your eyes will strain, and in no time at all your head will ache.

Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. Acknowledge Other/Context Minimizes self (sometimes context)\nPeople-pleasing tendencies Therapeutic Implications: Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs\nAssertiveness/clear communication of needs\nLess directive therapy methods\nMultiple choice options to practice sense of agency Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval.

The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions.

She focused on the wholeness of the person and helped people move from positions of low self-esteem to become authentic and congruent.\nShe was considered the mother of family therapy. She was interested in communication, but added an emotional dimension that helped to counterbalance the cold and calculated approach. She realized the family therapy field lacked the connection to the emotional life of families. Satir saw troubled family members as trapped in narrow roles that limit options and sap self-esteem. She was the humanizing force in early days of therapy where the rest of the field was focused on the systems metaphor. She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html","therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html#_0","therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html#_0","therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0","glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html","therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/avanta-network.html#_0"],"author":"Millie","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1714154436886,"modifiedTime":1722380722610,"sourceSize":2299,"sourcePath":"University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Therapy Theories and Modalities/Experiential Family Therapy/Satir/Key Terms and Concepts/Virginia Satir.md","exportPath":"therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/wheel-of-influence.html":{"title":"Wheel of Influence","icon":"","description":"\nIn Satir's Growth Model, a chart including all the people who influenced the <a data-href=\"Star\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Star</a> when they were growing up.

To change the world is to change the family.\nFamily life is something like an iceberg: most people are aware of only about one-tenth of what is going on - the tenth that they can see and hear. Just as a sailor's fate depends on knowing that the bulk of the iceberg is under the water, so a family's fate depends on understanding the feelings and needs that lie beneath every family events. (What goes on under the table?) Over the years I have developed a picture of what human beings living humanly are like. They are people who understand, value, and develop their bodies, finding them beautiful and useful. They are real and honest to and about themselves and others; they are loving and kind to themselves and others. People living humanly are willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, and to change when the situation calls for it. They find ways to accommodate what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not. The family is the context in which a person with such dimensions developers. And the adults in charge are the peoplemakers. Four aspects of family life: The feelings and ideas one has about oneself, which I call self-worth. The ways people use to work out meaning with one another, which I call communication.\nThe rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into what I call the family system.\nThe way people relate to other people and institutions outside the family, which I call the link to society. In all the troubled families I noticed that: Self-wroth was low\nCommunication was indirect, vague, and not really honest\nRules were indirect, nonnegotiable, and everlasting\nThe family's link to society was fearful, placating, and blaming In all nurturing families, I consistently see a different pattern: Self-worth is high\nCommunication is direct, clear, specific, and honest\nRules are flexible, human, appropriate, and subject to change\nThe link to society is open and hopeful, and is based on choice The changes all rest on new learnings, new awareness, and a new consciousness. Everyone can achieve these. Families everywhere deal with the same issues. In all families... Every person communicates; the question is, How, and what happens as a result? Every person follows rules; the question is, What kind, and how well do they work for them? Every person is linked to society; the question is, In what way, and what are the results? Natural Family The man and woman who sired and conceived the child continue to care for that child until the child is grown One-Parent Family One parent leaves the family by death, divorce, or desertion, and all of the parenting is done by the remaining parent Blended Family Children are parented by step-, adoptive, foster, or gay parents Institutional Family Groups of adults rear groups of children, as in institutions, communes, or extended families The same forces will be at work in all families: Self-Worth\nCommunication\nRules\nLinks to Society People are always doing the best they can. Developing a family is the hardest, most complicated job in the world. The very fact that you are reading this tells me that you care about yourself and the well-being of your family. Knowing something begins a change; experiencing makes it happen. If you feel shy or doubtful about inviting family members to participate in these exercises with you, become thoroughly familiar with what you are asking, feel it from your heart, and present your wish simply and directly. \"Will you participate with me in an experiment that I think might be useful to use?\" You maximize the opportunity for a positive response. Badgering, demanding, or nagging people to go along turns the transaction into a power struggle. <br>(I think this may be refer to the <a data-href=\"Battle for Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle for Structure</a> and the <a data-href=\"Battle for Initiative\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle for Initiative</a>) I see two kinds of pain: Pain of recognition of problems\nPain of blame\nThe first we can't avoid; the second we can.

Does it feel good to you to live in your family right now?\nDo you feel you are living with friends, people you like and trust, and who like and trust you?\nIs it fun and exciting to be a member of your family?\nFamily that is more or less troubled does not mean you have a bad family. It only means that people aren't very happy and have not learned ways to love and value one another openly. Families can be placed somewhere along a scale from 'very nurturing' to 'very troubled' The atmosphere in a troubled family is easy to feel. I quickly sense discomfort. Sometimes it feels cold. Sometimes it feels as if everything were constantly spinning, like a top; I get dizzy and can't find my balance. Or it may be an atmosphere of foreboding, like the lull before a storm, when thunder may crash and lightning strike at any moment. Sometimes I feel very sad and cannot find an obvious reason. I realize that's because the sources are covered up. I begin to understand why so many members of troubled families were beset with physical ills. Their bodies were simply reacting humanly to a very inhuman atmosphere. Everybody has physical reactions to individuals around him or her. The first step of change is to recognize what is happening. There is little evidence of friendship among individual family members, little joy in one another. The family seems to stay together through duty, with people just trying to tolerate one another. More often humor is caustic, sarcastic, even cruel. The adults are so busy telling the child and each other what to do and what not to do that they never get to enjoy themselves as persons. In some families, people simply avoided one another. The family can be the place where one finds love and understanding and support, even when all else fails; where we can be refreshed and recharged to cope more effectively with the world outside. No one would intentionally pick this troubled way of living. Families accept it only because they know of no other way. A nurturing family is where I would be listened to and would be interested in listening to others; I would be considered and would wish to consider others. I could openly show my affection as well as my pain and disapproval. I would not be afraid to take risks because everyone in my family would realize that some mistakes are bound to come with my risk-taking - that my mistakes are a sign that I am growing. I would feel like a person in my own right - noticed, valued, loved, and clearly asked to notice, value, and love others. I would feel free to respond with humor and laughter when it fits. The houses in which these people live tend to have a lot of light and color. Clearly a place where people live, these homes are planned for their comfort and enjoyment, not as showplaces for the neighbors. When there is quiet, it is peaceful quiet, not the stillness of fear and caution. Each person seems to know that they will have the chance to be heard. If one's turn doesn't come now, it is only because there isn't time - not because one isn't loved. People seem comfortable about touching one another and showing their affection, regardless of age. People show their loving and caring by talking openly and listening with concern, being straight and real with one another, and simply being together. Members of a nurturing family feel free to tell each other how they feel. Anything can be talked about. Nurturing families can make plans. If something interferes with the plan, they can readily make adjustments, often with a sense of humor. This way they are able to handle more of life's problems without panicking. Thus the incident would be used as a learning opportunity (which raises the child's self-worth) rather than as a cause for punishment, which puts that self-worth into question. In the nurturing family it is easy to pick up the message that human life and human feelings are more important than anything else. These parents see themselves as empowering leaders, not as authoritative bosses. They see their job primarily as one of teaching their children how to be truly human in all situations. The behavior of these parents matches what they say. How different from the troubled parent who tells the children not to hurt each other, but slaps them whenever displeased. Parents are people; they learn that good leaders are careful of their timing: they watch for an opportunity to talk to their children when they can really be heard. When a child has misbehaved, the father or mother moves physically close to offer support. This helps the offending child overcome fear and guilt feelings and make the best of the teaching the parent is about to offer. We can help make new contacts with others and pave the way for better ways of dealing with each other. Parents in nurturing families know that their children are not intentionally bad. If someone behaves destructively, parents realize some misunderstanding has arisen or someone's self-esteem is dangerously low. They know people learn only when valuing themselves and feeling valued, so they don't respond to behavior in a way that will make people feel devalued. Even when it is possible to change behavior by shaming or punishing, the resulting scar is not easily or quickly healed. When a child must be corrected, nurturing parents rely on being clear: Asking for information, listening, touching, understanding, using careful timing, and being aware of the child's feelings and natural wishes to learn and to please. Children learn from the modeling of direct behavior. Parents in a nurturing family realize problems come along, simply because life offers them, and they will be alert to creative solutions as each new problem appears. Troubled families, on the other hand, put all their energies into the hopeless attempt to keep problems from happening; when they do happen - and, of course, they always do - these people have no resources left for solving the crisis. Nurturing parents realize change is inevitable. They accept change as part of being alive and try to use it creatively to make their families still more nurturing. The human heart is always seeking love. Troubled families make troubled people and thus contribute to the devaluing of self. Giving ourselves full permission to make the family a place to develop people who are more truly human will reflect itself in a safer and more humanly responsive world. We can make the family a real place for developing real people. Each of us is a discovery, and each of us makes a difference. Most of the things that caused families to be troubled are learned after birth. Since they are learned, they can be unlearned, and new things can be learned in their place. You need to recognize that your family sometimes is a troubled family. You need for forgive yourself for past mistakes and give yourself permission to change, knowing that things can be different. Make a decision to change things. Take some action to start the process of change. Whatever may have happened in the past represented the best you knew how to do at the time. Chances are that the causes of your family pain have been invisible to all of you. <br><a data-href=\"Self-Esteem or Self-Worth\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is a concept, an attitude, a feeling, an image; and it is represented by behavior. When I was a little girl, I lived on a farm in Wisconsin. On our back porch was a huge black iron pot, which had lovely rounded sides and stood on three legs. My mother made her own soap, so for part of the year the pot was filled with soap. When threshing crews came through in the summer, we filled the pot with stew. At other times, my father used it to store manure for my mother's flower beds. We came to call it the \"3-S pot.\" Anyone who wanted to use the pot faced two questions: What is the pot now full of, and how full is it? When people told me about themselves - whether they felt full, empty, dirty, or even 'cracked' - I thought of that old pot. Pot is a plain word in this use, almost a nonsense word. Families often find it easier to express themselves in pot terms and to understand when other people express themselves this way. When I say 'pot,' I mean self-worth or self-esteem. Every person has a feeling of worth, positive or negative. As with my old family pot, the questions are: Is my self-worth negative or positive at this point, and how much of it is there? <br><a data-href=\"Self-Esteem or Self-Worth\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is the ability to value one's self and to treat oneself with dignity, love, and reality. Anyone who is loved is open to change. The crucial factor in what happens both inside people and between people is one's self-worth, one's pot. Integrity, honesty, responsibility, compassion, love, and competence - all flow easily from people whose self-esteem is high. We feel that we matter, that the world is a better place because we are here. We have faith in our own competence. We are able to ask others for help, yet we believe we can make our own decisions and are, in the end, our own best resources. Appreciating our own worth, we are ready to see and respect the worth of others. We radiate trust and hope. We don't have rules against anything we feel. We also know that we don't have to act on everything we feel. We can choose. Our intelligence directs our actions. We accept all of ourselves as human. Vital people feel high-pot most of the time. But vital people treat these temporary low-pot feelings as just what they are: a crisis of the moment. This crisis might well be the birth pains of some new possibility for us. We may feel uncomfortable at the time but do not have to hide. We know we can emerge from this crisis whole. When people feel they have little worth, they expect to be cheated, stepped on, and depreciated by others. This opens the way to becoming a victim. Expecting the worst, these people invite it and usually get it. To defend themselves, they hide behind a wall of distrust and sink into the terrible feeling of loneliness and isolation. Thus separated from other people, they become apathetic, indifferent toward themselves and those around them. It is hard for them to see, hear, or think clearly, and therefore they tend to step on and depreciate others. People who feel this way build huge psychological walls behind which they hide, and then defend themselves by denying they are doing this. Fear is a natural consequence of this distrust and isolation. Fear constricts and blinds us; it keeps us from risking new ways of solving our problems. Instead, we turn to still more self-defeating behavior. (Fear, incidentally, is always fear of some future thing) As soon as a person confronts or challenges whatever they are afraid of in the present, the fear vanishes. When persons with constant low-pot feelings experience defeat, they often label themselves as failures. After enough of these reactions, the self is vulnerable to drugs, alcohol, or others flights from coping. Feeling low is not the sameas low-pot. Low pot essentially means that when you experience undesireable feelings, you try to behave as though those feelings did not exist. It takes a lot of high self-worth to acknowledge your low feelings. Persons of high self-esteem can feel low. The difference is that people who are feeling low don't label themselves as worthless or pretend that their low feelings do not exist. Nor do they project their feeling on someone else. It makes a big difference whether one condemns one's self or sees this low time as a human condition with which one needs to cope. I shall be frequently calling your attention to this process of coping. Feeling low and not admitting it is a form of lying to yourself and others. Devaluing your feelings this way is a direct link to devaluing yourself, thus deepening the conditions of low pot. Much of what happens to us is the outcome of our attitude. Since it is attitude, we can change it. To build your self-worth: Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.\nWe need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. An infant coming into the world must rely on experiences with people and their messages about their worth as a person. For the first five or six years, the child's self-esteem is formed almost exclusively by the family. After the child starts school, other influences come into play; the family remains important. Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even \"Pass the potatoes, please\" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication).\nHalfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued?\nTomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere in which individual differences are appreciated, love is shown openly, mistakes are used for learning, communication is open, rules are flexible, responsibility (matching promise with delivery) is modeled and honest is practiced - the kind of atmosphere found in a nurturing family. Children in troubled families often feel worthless, growing up as they must amid 'crooked' communication, inflexible rules, criticism of their differentness, punishment for their mistakes, and no experience in learning responsibility. Such children are highly at risk of developing destructive behavior toward themselves and/or others. Much of an individual's potential is held in abeyance when this happens. Parents with high self-esteem are more likely to create nurturing families, and low self-worth parents to produce troubled families. The system evolves out of the architects of the family: the parents. I do hold parents responsible for accepting the consequences of their actions and learning to do differently. This is a good first step to improving the whole family situation. <br>It is possible to raise anyone's <a data-href=\"Self-Esteem or Self-Worth\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a>, no matter what one's age or condition. Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. \"There is always hope that your life can change, because you can always learn new things.\"\n<br><a data-href=\"My Declaration of Self-Esteem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/my-declaration-of-self-esteem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">My Declaration of Self-Esteem</a> Our body language and activities reflect our thoughts and emotions. When we appreciate and love ourselves, our energy builds. When we use this energy positively and harmoniously to make a smoothly running system within each self, it creates a strong foundation from which that self can cope creatively, realistically, and compassionately with what life presents. \"When I feel good about myself and life myself, the chances are excellent that I will be able to meet life from a position of dignity, honesty, strength, love, and reality.\" If a person's feeling toward themselves is one of depreciation, limitation, disgust, or any other negative attitude, the energy becomes diffused and fragmented. The self weakens, becoming a victim defeated by life: \"If I do not like myself, I devalue and punish myself. I meet life from a position of fear and impotence, creating a state in which I feel victimized and act according. I punish myself and others blindly. I become interchangeably subservient and tyrannical. I hold others responsible for my actions.\" A person feels they do not count, feel a constant threat of rejection, and lacks the ability to look at themselves, others, and events in perspective. This is a state of low self-esteem.\nA person who does not value themselves will expect someone else to be responsible for bestowing that value. This often leads to endless manipulations that usually backfire on both parties. To avoid being against others, people have been taught to love others instead of themselves. This results in self-depreciation. The question also arises, if one does not love self, how can one know how to love others? We have plenty of evidence that loving oneself makes it possible to love others; self-worth and selfishness are not the same. I have found that the first step toward diminishing fear is to acknowledge it openly. Then check your perception: \"Is that true?\" Fear of Rejection Good human relations and appropriate and loving behavior stem from persons who have strong feelings of self-worth. Simply stated, persons who love and value themselves are able to love and value others and treat reality appropriately. Having a strong sense of self-worth is the way to become more fully human, to having health and happiness, gaining and maintaining satisfying relationships, and being appropriate, effective, and responsible. When one cares for oneself, one will not do anything to injure, degrade, humiliate, or otherwise destroy oneself or another, and will not hold others responsible for one's actions. People who care for themselves would not violate their relationships to others through violence. Those who do not love themselves can easily become instruments of hate and destruction by unscrupulous people. They essentially give away their power, which often leads to emotional slavery. Perpetual placating exemplifies this. The stronger one's self-worth, the easier it is to have and maintain the courage to change one's behavior. The more one values oneself, the less one demands from others. The less one demands from others, the more one can feel trust. The more one trusts oneself and others, the more one can love. The more one loves others, the less one fears them. The more one builds with them, the more one can know them. The more one knows another, the greater is one's bond and bridge with them. Self-worth behavior will thus help end the isolation and alienation between persons, groups, and nations today. <br>(MA: is this referencing <a data-href=\"Differentiation of Self\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Differentiation of Self</a>?)

Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis. <br>The goal of Satir's therapy is to help people enhance their own and others' self-esteem. When we do so, we function from a <a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication stance. This is the healthiest position we can operate from. The Satir Growth Model is a strength-based approach, focusing on the existing resources that family members bring with them. Faulty coping strategies maintain problematic interactions. Therapy provides a safe space for people to choose alternative ways of coping. Therapy increases people's self-esteem, leading them to be able to lean into their uniqueness and provide a space for their loved ones to feel comfortable in their own uniqueness as well. Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic. (Congruence) Self-Esteem Maintenance Kit: Detective Hat: Used when there is something new that the person wants to understand better. It helped them shift away from judging an experience to exploring it. Medallion: Two-sided and says 'yes' on one side and 'no' on the other. It is intended to help the person recognize that they can say either word, depending on what they truly want, so they can maintain their integrity. Wand (Empowering wand, courage stick, wishing wand): Helps people move from inaction based on fear to action based on desire. Golden Key: Opens any door - helping the person ask questions they might not have previously, so the unsayable, and do the undoable. Wisdom Box: Helps connect the person to the wider world and all that has come before them. <br>Experiential therapists are interactive in the therapy room. They try to use their whole self for contact. This includes adopting an <a data-href=\"I-Thou Perspective\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">I-Thou Perspective</a>, where they try to promote human-to-human interaction. Since one of the main goals of therapy is to help the client become more congruent, it is important for the therapist to engage the client congruently. The therapist must be a real person who helps model a way of being for the client. Experiential therapists conceptualize a few main processes: Status Quo: The family is currently in this process, and is leading to difficulties bringing them to therapy. Foreign Element: The family's expression of the desire to change. Chaos: The therapist's introduction of novelty into the system. Integration: Family members put what they learn from therapy into practice. Practice: Involves trying out these learnings. New Status Quo:\n- New homeostasis takes hold.<br>\n<img alt=\"Satir's Growth Model Stages.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/satir's-growth-model-stages.png\" target=\"_self\"> The therapist raises the intensity of interactions so that people encounter their own experiences and can thus become more authentic. Therapy then helps people to allow others to be more authentic. <br><a data-href=\"Sculpting\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sculpting</a>: Sculpting helps people get in touch with their inner experience and express this experience to others in a way that bypasses the typical spoken word. Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways: The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another. <br><a data-href=\"Family Reconstruction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Family Reconstruction</a>: Designed to help an individual connect better to the historical and psychological interconnections of their family.

The therapist ('guide') begins the family reconstruction by telling the star's story; then sculpts the family of origin, the star's parents' families of origin, and the star's parents' relationship; and then resculpts the star's family of origin. The overall goal is to increase the star's self-esteem so they are empowered to engage with themselves and others in new and more productive ways. This should engender more hope in them for their future. <br><a data-href=\"Parts Party\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Parts Party</a>: Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes. \"The Growth Model,\" where the focus was on helping people access their inner resources as opposed to, \"The Medical Model,\" where the emphasis was on pathology and symptom reduction. <br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href=\"Unique Spirit\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. \"The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities.\" (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341) Her goals for family therapy included helping the individual members increase their sense of worth and value by accessing their inner resources and by decreasing any emotional blocks. And for the family as a whole, she saw the goal as being to increase congruent communication and heart connections. She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were: It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. It is not okay to feel what you feel.\nIt is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.\nIt is not okay to ask for what you want.\nIt is not okay to take risks. She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as: \"What do you see going on between your and your ?\"\n\"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?\"\n\"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?\"\n\"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?\"\n\"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family.\" <br>She also helped them to make better connections with each other by decreasing their defensiveness. Satir identified the primary defensive stances as <a data-href=\"Blaming (Blamer)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blaming (Blamer)</a>, <a data-href=\"Placating (Placator)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Placating (Placator)</a>, <a data-href=\"Distracting\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Distracting</a>, and being <a data-href=\"Super-Reasonable (Computer)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>.

Within a family system, these defenses can be played out in interactional patterns such as: Blame - Blame\nBlame - Withdraw\nPlacate - Placate\nBlame - Placate\nBlame - Distract\nWithdraw - Withdraw Satir developed a process for helping people change and become more connected. Her process is described as having six phases: Phase 1 - Making Contact Satir would reach out using her body position, eye contact, and facial expression to make contact with each member. She would also consciously work to connect from her spirit to theirs. Phase 2 - Validating Satir worked to help people feel validated in many ways such as reflecting their feelings, affirming their values and highlighting their inner resources. Examples include: \"You feel scared because your son got suspended from school.\"\n\"You value education.\"\n\"You are courageous to seek help.\" Phase 3 - Facilitating Awareness Satir had many different ways that she would attempt to bring awareness to a family about their defensive patterns in a non-blaming way. <br><a data-href=\"Sculpting\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sculpting</a>: Satir placed the members in body positions to give them a picture of their defensive behavior. For the blaming stance, she would position the person leaning toward another and pointing at them and for the placating stance, she would position the person down on one knee with their head down and their hand up in a pleading position. Satir would also bring awareness to members by exploring their inner experiences. She used the metaphor of an iceberg to help the family therapist to conceptualize the inner level so experience driving defensive behaviors. Above the water line were the inner levels of experience such as feelings, perceptions, expectations, beliefs, and yearnings. (What meaning are you giving to what your ___ said that is causing you to feel hurt? Is that a familiar place for you to go to when someone is disappointed in you? What is it you yearn for?) Phase 4 - Promoting Acceptance One of the ways that satir promoted acceptance was through 'normalizing,' that is, reassuring the family member that what they were experiencing was normal. (\"It is normal to...\")\nAnother way that she promoted acceptance was by 'bridging' between conflicting parties. (\"I am hearing that is is not easy for _, I would be interested to know how life was for you when you were their age?\") Phase 5 - Eliciting Positive Choices and Changes Once Satir observed that the family members were aware of and accepting of their unhelpful patterns, she would lead them into seeing new possibilities for their interactions. After sculpting the family, she would ask them to each to stand in a balanced way and look at each other. She would then guide them in a dialogue helping them to express themselves in non-defensives ways. Other times she would simply have them sit face to face and she would guide the dialogue between them. \"What happens for you when your says you choose over your ? You feel... Did you know that your felt __? What happened for you when you heard them express their feelings? You long to be more connected with them. You miss them. How do you feel to hear how much they miss you?\" Phase 6 - Reinforcing Change Satir would often combine verbal responses with some supportive touch to reinforce a positive shift. The therapist also needs to work on their own personal growth. This is true for working with individuals but it is even more true when working with families as the chances of being triggered by your own family experience are even greater. As Satir used to say, \"You are the most important instrument in the room!\" Under threat and reward, change is painful: change is viewed as unnatural, the unknown is feared, the status quo is maintained, life's natural 'flow' is blocked, and the familiar is valued despite discomfort. The seed model has people viewing change more positively; as naturally occurring at a variety of levels (from cellular to cosmic) and as scary, but offering new opportunities. Discomfort is seen as a signal for change. Therapists using the seed model keep in mind that families entering therapy are problem-focused and will maintain the status quo as a necessary survival behavior. Therapist should make contact with each person to communicate a climate of acceptance (e.g., people do the best they can) and hear them out to discover 'what is.'\nUnderstanding the status quo stage is essential to clarify how the change process gets started or is blocked. This stage is explored further by examining resistance and readiness concepts in detail. The coin of change has resistance and readiness as its head and tail sides. Experientially, we may want to change in one moment and fear or sabotage it in the next. Then status quo is considered a trance, accounting for change resistance as well as a medium in which change may be fostered. Changing circumstances elicit shifts in perception, which in turn stimulate changes in thinking, feeling, and acting. But when circumstances shift back, behavior also reverts. Perception can appear to create change of behavior when the meaning of an event is reframed, but the underlying pattern is not altered. Altering the underlying pattern requires dealing with resistance to change. Resistance is a coping behavior intended to preserve the organism rather than obstruct change. Reframing resistance in terms of its positive intention. The way we are socialized has us, \"Gradually acquiring a variety of commitments which constrain the person into following a consistent pattern of behavior.\" The effect is to develop a lifestyle that stabilizes the events in our lives, our interdependence of meaning of these events, and the way we define ourselves, as well as predisposing us to seek consistent situations. Experientially, change involves invoking the unfamiliar. Intellectualizing, avoiding feelings, compulsive activity, impatience about change, and dwelling in the past are all ways of dealing with the confusion by maintaining the status quo. The tasks at this stage are to cope with the threat to past security and sense of competence and self-esteem; deal with feelings of loss and longing for the past.\nConservative impulse, the will to change has to overcome an impulse to restore the past, to resist the change. Survival depends on this impulse. By stabilizing perceptions, the conservative impulse enhances the ability to learn from experience. Only when it does not fit this construct is its 'newness' experienced. <br><a data-href=\"Readiness\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/readiness.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Readiness</a> refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href=\"Status Quo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Status Quo</a>. Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain. Four patterns emerge reflecting the relative influence of these readiness factors. These patters are based on the degree of difficulty involved in making the change and the degree of responsibility the person is wiling to take for making the change. <br><a data-href=\"Preemptive Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Preemptive Change</a>: This pattern describes 'overnight' change. The inordinate strength of the motivating influences lowers the degree of difficulty in making the change. The degree of responsibility for the change is also low. The change in circumstances preempts issues of loss (leaving family and friends), self-efficacy (\"Can I do it?\"), and self-esteem (\"Am I worth the effort?\") that are ordinarily addressed in making changes. Problems maintaining the change may require attention at a later point in the change process. Change literally 'happens' to us in this pattern, but we have little sense of ownership of it. <br><a data-href=\"Self-Managed Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Managed Change</a>: In this pattern, the influences motivating the change are less extreme or immediate than those noted in the preemptive patter. The person is influenced to take a conscious and self-responsible approach to change and is required to deal with one or more of the issues of loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in order to resolve the resistance to change. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://youtu.be/ql3mPOcX7kY?si=OJDap3I_-IK8_nXP\" target=\"_self\">Satir Family Therapy - YouTube</a> Experiential family therapies include four approaches: <br><a data-href=\"Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/satir's-growth-model-(human-validation-process-movement).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Satir's Growth Model (Human Validation Process Movement)</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/symbolic-experiential-family-therapy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/emotionally-focused-therapy-(eft)/emotionally-focused-therapy-(eft).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Internal Family Systems Model\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/internal-family-systems-model.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Internal Family Systems Model</a> Targeting emotional transactions\nWarmth, empathy, and the therapist's use of self\nIndividual and family focus Five Communication Stances: <br><a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> Able to acknowledge what you are thinking and feeling, what the other person may be thinking or feeling <br><a data-href=\"Placating (Placator)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Placating (Placator)</a> Ignore their own thoughts and feelings and focus on the thoughts and feelings of others.

Help them learn to recognize, and not be afraid of their thoughts and the thoughts of others. Stances acknowledge or minimize three realities: Self\nOther\nContext When we feel unsafe, we revert back to one of these communication stances. These are the stances used when someone is frightened. When we don't feel safe as children, we evolve communication stances to survive when we do not feel safe when we are young. You can use the communication stances to help better understand how to intervene, or how to communicate with your client. When you are working with a placator, be cautious if you are going to be making a suggestion it may help to give options. \"Which do you think is the best fit or might work for you?\" Ask them to give voice to their thoughts and opinions because they will be very quick even to please the therapist. Their task us to learn to assert themselves in a healthy way, how can they assert their needs so that they don't become resentful, depressed (needs do not get taken care of because they are not advocating for themselves) Therapy involves going through stages several times.

Emotional Role of Symptom Symptom has a role in the family system Example: Child's exaggerated acting out may serve to reduce tension in marriage by getting parents on the same page.

Problematic family dynamics typically involve: Power struggles\nParental conflicts\nLack of validation\nLack of intimacy Each person's role in family is assessed to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles: Martyr\nVictim or helpless one\nRescuer\nGood child/parent\nBad child/parent Timeline that includes major events in individual's or family's life.

Child, mother, and father and quality of relationship between them. In this primary triad a child learns how to be human. The triad should serve as nurturing system for child. When the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved.

Ingredients of an interaction Whenever the therapist is talking with clients about difficult situations and interactions with others, they ask a series of questions. Go back to the iceberg. What do I hear and see? What is happening at the behavioral level without any interpretation. What are the meanings I make of this? What are they saying? What feelings do I have about these meanings I am making? What feelings do I have about those feelings? What defenses do I use/am I using? How does this trigger me and what kind of defensive behaviors might I bring, that makes them …. ?\nWhat are the rules within the system about how to comment about what's going on? What is allowed and what is appropriate? How am I responding and what part do I play in the system? Facilitating emotional expression What is allowed and what is appropriate? What is my response and what am I doing in this situation?\nCongruent expression, without the communication stances, turn chairs to each other directly, hold hands, make eye contact Softening family rules When families have rigid rules about who can say what, when, where, and how, she will soften some of these to create more space for everyone's particular way of communicating in a comfortable way to hopefully reduce the use of communication stances. Communication enhancement Helping each member of the family learn to communicate congruently in stressful circumstances, even when they do feel threatened by their partner or their child, Rather than reverting to a survival stance, to help them learn how to be fully congruent and present and to have more effective communications. Sculpting or spatial metaphor She would position each person in the family to metaphorically represent their role. (Example: A placator may be sculpted as being on their knees and begging, the blamer may be there pointing their finger angrily at someone, the irrelevant type might be in a strange position far off from everybody else, the super-reasonable might be sitting there in a very cold, distant, \"I am citing the rulebook\")\nBecause it is more visual than verbal - you can add a verbal element to it by having each person say a motto of theirs (eg., \"Please be nice to me,\" \"Do what I say,\" \"Follow the rules,\") - that represents their position in the family. It can push past the survival stances, intellectual defenses, the family could sculpt themselves.\nIt can be a powerful intervention. Touch Touch clients, help clients learn to hold and touch each other in nurturing ways, The therapist must be aware of cultures that have different attitudes towards emotional expression. The therapist adjusts to the client's level of intimacy. Used commonly in the LGBTQ community Focus is on the burden of societal rejection when being the authentic self. Combined main ideas from systemic and humanistic theories: Targeting emotional transactions from the interactional pattern\nTherapists use warmth, empathy, and self to facilitate desired change.

Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated. <br>She began her career in family therapy at the <a data-href=\"Mental Research Institute (MRI)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a> working alongside <a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href=\"Paul Watzlawick\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/paul-watzlawick.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Paul Watzlawick</a>, <a data-href=\"Richard Fisch\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/richard-fisch.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Richard Fisch</a>, and the other leading family therapists in Palo Alto.

Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. <br><img alt=\"Blamer Stance Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/blamer-stance-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nTherapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.\nWith these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. <br><img alt=\"Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nWhen working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others. <br><img alt=\"Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nA client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently. <br><a data-href=\"Virginia Satir\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Virginia Satir</a> She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program. <br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href=\"Cybernetics\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. <br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href=\"Second-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. The six-stages: <br><a data-href=\"Status Quo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Status Quo</a> This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. <br><a data-href=\"Foreign Element\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Foreign Element</a> May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. <br><a data-href=\"Chaos\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chaos</a> <br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href=\"Positive Feedback\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href=\"Status Quo\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. <br><a data-href=\"Integration of New Possibilities\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Integration of New Possibilities</a> Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. Practice The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions: Are the symptoms improving?\nIs each person able to self-actualize and grow? New Status Quo This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. Four primary assumptions about people and therapy: People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).\nAll people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).\nEvery person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)\nTherapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle). These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works: Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities: <br><a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness\n<br>Accurate <a data-href=\"Empathy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empathy</a>\nUnconditional Positive Regard These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. <br>The more therapists are <a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. <br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href=\"Self-Mandala\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels': Mind\nBody\nSpirit\nOpen body position and congruent communication are critical. Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. Making contact involves: Making direct eye contact\nTouching clients (e.g., shaking hands)\nSitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)\nAsking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called <br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href=\"Empathy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.\nComments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., \"It sounds as though you felt betrayed\") Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed. <br><a data-href=\"Role of the Symptom\"

rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mind-Body Connection</a> Satir viewed the symptom as having a role in the family system. Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)? If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics: Power Struggles These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. Parental Conflicts These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. Lack of Validation The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. Lack of Intimacy There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem. Possible roles include: <br><a data-href=\"Martyr\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Martyr</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Victim or Helpless One\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Victim or Helpless One</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Rescuer\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rescuer</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Good Child or Parent\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Good Child or Parent</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Bad Child or Parent\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bad Child or Parent</a> The family life chronology is a timeline that includes the major events in an individual's or family's life. Births and deaths\nImportant family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)\nImportant historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns) This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child? Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.\nAt any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. The six layers of the iceberg: Behavior The behavior on the surface; the external manifestations of the person's inner world.

Feelings Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. Perceptions Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality). Expectation A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). Yearnings Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. <br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href=\"Self-Compassion\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.' The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions. The mind-body connection considers how emotional issues may manifest in the body, either symbolically or functionally. The role of nutrition and exercise is assessed. <br>Satir maintained that the way the body is used indicates the person's <a data-href=\"Communication Stances\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Communication Stances</a> : <br><a data-href=\"Congruent (Congruence)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congruent (Congruence)</a> Communication and <a data-href=\"Self-Esteem or Self-Worth\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> Open and relaxed body postures <br><a data-href=\"Placating (Placator)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Placating (Placator)</a> Timid and reserved postures <br><a data-href=\"Blaming (Blamer)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blaming (Blamer)</a> Pointing, angry, and stiff postures <br><a data-href=\"Super-Reasonable (Computer)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a> Cold and distant postures <br><a data-href=\"Irrelevant (Distractor)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a> Hyper and distracted The goal of Satir's model is transformation: To achieve optimal realization of a person's full potential. This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning: Relational, family, or systemic goals\nIndividual goals The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication: The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches: To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression.

Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.\nSince the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. Other Stop reading for a few minutes and think about some families you know that would fit the description “troubled.” Did the family you grew up in have some of these characteristics: Was your family at times cold, deadening, super polite, secretive, confusing? What are the characteristics of the family you are living in now? Can you discover any signs of trouble that you haven’t been aware of before?\nCan you think of a family that you would call nurturing at least part of the time? Can you remember a time recently when your family could be described as nurturing? Try to remember how it felt to be in your family then. Do these times happen often?\nInvite your family members to try the following experiment with you. Take a partner, then tell one another your feelings (\"Right now, I feel scared/tight/embarrassed/happy/etc.\"). Each partner simply thanks the other without judging or commenting. You thus hear one another's feelings so you can know each other better. We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. Practice as much as you can with people you trust. Now, tell each other what makes you each feel low, or high. You may find new dimensions to the people you have been living with all these years and feel closer or more real to them as a result. When you have finished the exercise, give yourself permission to share what happened for you.\nTonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even \"Pass the potatoes, please\" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication). Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued? Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. Take a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon. The topic is “What new has been happening to me lately?” Everyone has a chance to share, not just the children. Leadership can rotate among the members. Don’t forget the celebration party afterward.

He believed people limited themselves based on not accepting their full selves. He was opposed to theory. He believed if a theory became regimented, so did the therapist. This would be problematic because the therapist would be unable to be fully present and spontaneous, which is the goal for both family therapists and clients. The more people can allow themselves to be spontaneous, the more authentic they will likely be. <br><a data-href=\"Absurdity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Absurdity</a>: Happens when people realize what they have been thinking is not as fearful or destructive as they originally imagined. Families tend to have problems because they are engaging in rigid and repetitive ways of interacting. People have developed limiting roles. Operating only from this one role, people don't access all aspects for self. However, people are not usually aware they are operating from such a limiting role. Further, they are not connected to their emotions and how they suppress them. This restriction of experiencing was considered crazy. Craziness: Can be viewed in two ways: <br><a data-href=\"Negative Craziness\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/negative-craziness.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Negative Craziness</a>: Happens when people restrict themselves to a rigid way of believing and doing. Negative craziness leads people to continue behaving in ways that are not working without being able to see new possibilities. <br><a data-href=\"Positive Craziness\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/positive-craziness.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Positive Craziness</a>: Occurs when people don't restrict themselves to rigid roles and rules. Rather, they can be spontaneous and allow themselves to experience the full possibilities of their being. This type of craziness leads to growth. Symptoms happen in families when members develop expectations of themselves and others that are limiting. They've learned how to be with one another using fused or rigid boundaries. When there are fused boundaries, members become overly dependent on one another. They then are unable to assert their individuality. With rigid boundaries, members feel isolated from one another. Each extreme boundary limits people's expectation of self and others, where they are unable to access the full range of their experience. These extreme boundaries get pushed further away from the center when the family experience some type of stress. Some stress comes from outside the system, stress also happens when the family moved to a different development stage. Families may also have intergenerational stress. In these situations, family members tighten up and try to become even more rigid in how they view themselves and others, as this is how they think they can better handle their problems. When they do so, they restrict the possible alternatives that could help the family to grow. The goal of symbolic-experiential family therapy is about growth rather than symptom remission. Symptoms are a result of restrictions. When the family grows through the development of autonomy in its members, individual symptoms are likekly to recede. Therapy attempts to enrich people's lives, pushing them to experience happiness, sadness, anger, jealousy, joy, and the full range of all human emotions. Therapy is not about education but rather about experiencing, helping people to move beyond arbitrarily placed limits on what they can think, say, or do. The therapist is considered a 'coach' but not a player on the team. They will challenge people to examine the interdynamics happening in the family, but family members always have free choice in what they do.\n- Whitaker discussed two types of battles that happen in therapy:<br>\n- <a data-href=\"Battle for Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle for Structure</a>:\n- There is a determination of what therapy will look like. In this battle, the therapist must win. Families come to therapy and try to recapitulate their interactional process, incorporating the therapist into it. It is exactly this process that is maintaining the problem and that needs to be altered. If the therapist capitulated to the family's demands, they would be reinforcing the dysfunctional family process.\n- From the start of therapy, the therapist needs to send the message that something different will happen.<br>\n- <a data-href=\"Battle for Initiative\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle for Initiative</a>:\n- There is a determination of what family members will do in their lives. This battle needs to be won by the family. Symbolic-experiential family therapists do not try to tell family members what to do or how to live their lives. If they do so, they would be discouraging family members from being authentic. The family must take the initiative in how they want their life to go, with the family members actively supporting this push.<br>\n<img alt=\"Battle for Structure and Initiative Diagram.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/battle-for-structure-and-initiative-diagram.png\" target=\"_self\">\nSymbolic-experiential family therapy attempts to shake up the family. The therapist increases the anxiety in the therapy room, so that the family's normal ways of dealing with stress do not relieve it. They will then need to develop new ways of being with one another. The therapist has an unlimited amount of tools available to them. Anything can be used if it serves the purpose of helping people be more authentic. One of the hallmarks of this model is the use of a co-therapy team. The co-therapists are there to help augment each other. While one person is engaged with the family, the other can sit back and get a wider view of the family process. They can then put this information back into the conversation to try to stir up the family. Having a co-therapist can model for the family how to engage one another productively, even if at times they disagree with one another.

But there are major differences between modernism and postmodernism. Two central tenets of the Enlightenment (beginning of the 'modern' period) were as follows: The perfectibility of human nature\nThe belief in human progress through the development of human knowledge, especially the sciences. In the 20\nth century, scientific findings, like quantum physics, seriously undermined the possibility of a deterministic model of the world. As a guiding principle, reason was still affirmed as was the belief in human progress. The project of modernism was to examine the impediments still holding society back. Individuals ceased to believe that art and literary works bore one unique meaning; rather, postmodernists believed in deriving their own meanings from works of art and literature.\nModernism: It was an emancipatory project whose main idea was that traditional values and institutions were oppressive, divisive and inefficient and should, therefore, be replaced by rational values and institutions. Modernism led to progress in many spheres of life by changing the approach of mankind towards culture. Ultimately, modernism attempted to free humanity from its historical baggage through the use of philosophy and science. Postmodernism: Postmodernism was a reaction to modernism and was influenced by disenchantment brought on by the second world war. Postmodernism refers to the state that lacks a central hierarchy and one that is complex, ambiguous, and diverse. Postmodernists are the nihilists.\nPostmodernists like Heidegger, Derrida, and Lyotard attacked the modernist belief in rationality, objectivity and universalism in favor of relativism (the view that there is no objective truth) as well as identity.\nGrand narratives like freedom, societal progress, scientific progress were criticized by postmodernists, who instead emphasized that difference, rather than forced unity, should be celebrated. Postmodernism is a backlash against modernity. The collapse of tradition created a frightening situation whereby meaning became difficult to discern amid the horror of societal breakdown. Postmodernism, hence, represented a loss in faith in human reason. Postmodernism provides a bleak prognosis of the human condition and offers no real solutions. Conclusion:\n- Modernism and postmodernism were both movements that emerged from an analysis of events within the modern period from the perspective of the values of the Enlightenment.\n<a data-href=\"Postmodernism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/postmodernism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Postmodernism</a>: Theory that knowledge of things are not real unless we give them meaning.\nThe sense of self is a social construct. Our identity is created by interactions with other people and our reactions to society. Two threads: Weak (Social Constructionism): Proposes that social constructs are dependent on brute facts (most basic and fundamental facts and do not rely on other facts).\nInstitutional facts are created by social conventions and rely on other facts. Strong (Social): The whole of reality is dependent on social habits. All knowledge is a social construct and there are no brute facts. It would say we created the idea of something and how to explain it. Main criticism: Does not take into consideration the effect of natural phenomenon that goes on in society. Social constructionism only explains reality through the thoughts of humans, not by using fundamental brute facts. <br><a data-href=\"Michael White\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/michael-white.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Michael White</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"David Epston\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/david-epston.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">David Epston</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Gene Combs\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/gene-combs.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gene Combs</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Jill Freedman\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/key-figures/jill-freedman.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jill Freedman</a> Knowledge is constructed. Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave.\nExperience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. Experiences can have multiple interpretations. The Narrative Metaphor: Focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. \\Problems affect people. Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. Hence letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams. The truth of experience is not DISCOVERED, it is CREATED.\nNarrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narratives of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new future. People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-stories aspects of their lives and relationships. Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. We 'story' and create meaning of life events using available dominant discourses - broad social stories, practices, assumptions, and expectations about how we should live.\n'Problems':\nExperienced when a person's personal life does not fit with these societal discourses and expectations. Process involves separating the person from the problem. Understanding Oppression: Dominant vs. Local Discourses Dominant discourses are culturally generated stories about how life should go. Local discourses occur in our heads, our closer relationships, and marginalized communities. Narrative therapists help clients become aware of how these different discourses are impacting their lives. Avoid judgements about what is 'normal.'\nAvoid categorizing. Avoid the idea of general principles of what causes problems or what resolves them. The stories people tell themselves. Interpret their experience in unhelpful ways. Patterns of tunnel vision. Problem-saturated stories take hold and encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. Separate the problem-saturated stories to open space for: New and more constructive views of themselves.\nLook for unique outcomes 'Sparking events' Deconstruction: View the problem as an external entity to start challenging its influence. Unique Outcomes: Resistance to the problem's influence\nOpens room for counter stories Involves finding new ways to view, interact with, and respond to problems by defining the role of the problems in their lives. Broadly involves the following phases: Meeting\nListening\nSeparating persons from problems\nEnacting preferred narratives\nSolidifying Process thickens and enriches a person's identity and life accounts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. At the end of each meeting, the therapists asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?\nThen, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?\nMeetings are typically 60 minutes\nLength of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between) Collaborative\nCarefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem\nWith permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem\nTakes notes of what works and what doesn't\nDecentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation Meeting the person apart from the problem\nSeparating people from problems: The problem is the problem Optimism and hope\nCo-author/co-editor\nInvestigate reporter Problem-saturated stories\nUnique outcomes and sparkling events\nDominant cultural and gender discourses\nLocal and alternative discourses: Attending to client language and meaning Holds a position of curiosity.\nCherishes each person/family's unique stories. Invite clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. Narrative Therapy Principles: Therapist influential, but decentered.\nPerson separate from problem. All problems have exceptions. Opposite of problem is preferred. Preferred story woven into identity. Impact of relationships explored. Deconstruct societal norms. Personal decision making supported. Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. The problem is the problem. Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family. <br><a data-href=\"Social Constructionism\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Social Constructionism</a>: There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (reexamining) established truths that oppress people's lives. People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems).\nPeople are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. People are not their problems. People can develop alternative empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. Reject categorizing people. In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves WITH clients. They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis).\nWant to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relationships. When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relation to it. Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict. Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story\nProblems may be regarded as alien invaders Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)\nOpen space for new and more constructive views of themselves. Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy\nSearch for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. <br><a data-href=\"Deconstruction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions\n<br><a data-href=\"Reconstruction\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience\nEffects Questions: Elicit effects of the problem \"How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationship?\"\n\"Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful.\" Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multistoried lives.\nOnce people notice how their stories are problem saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time\nAt the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?\nThen, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?\nMeetings are typically 60 minutes\nLength of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between) CAUTION: Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories INSTEAD: narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories Counterstory Asking permission is central to the model\nAt the start of the first meeting, the therapist ask if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy.\nLater meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from the previous session aloud and asking question, such as: Can you tell me about new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time Other times the therapist begins by wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations\nTherapists use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session\nOr sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem\nReading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keeping a story alive and growing Collaborative\nCarefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem.\nTakes note of what works and what doesn't\nDecentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation Therapy is a relationship - a conversation Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories\nOpen space for describing alternatives\nInvite families to add, subtract, or describe differently\nEncourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments\nThe therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders\nTherapists have more questions than answers It sounds as though problem is part of your life now.\nHow long have you been noticing this problem?\nWhat effect does the problem have on your life?\nHow does the problem impact your relationships?\nDoes problem have an impact on your relationship with other family members?\nWhat do you think about the effects the problem is having on your life?\nAre you accepting what problem is doing?\nAre these effects acceptable to you or not?\nWhy is this? Why are you taking this position on what problem is doing?\nHow would you prefer things to be? People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.\nThe therapist invites family members to: Evaluate their current situation\nName the problems involved\nEvaluate their relationship to those problems\nTake a stand in regard to them\nTell more satisfying stories of their lives\nEvaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. Private hopes and fears\nFamily interactions\nContributions of culture of origin\nTraditions, legacies Questioning: Is that the problem speaking?\nWhose values are guiding you in saying that? By exposing discouses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. What name would you give the problem?\nWhat is it like to experience the problem?\nWhat effect does the problem have on your life?\nWhat effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?\nWhat talks have you have about the problem in your family? What impacts has that had?\nWhat effects does the problem have on your other relationships?\nHow does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?\nIs this what you want for your life? Why or why not?\nAre we talking about what you want to be talking about?\nIs this conversation useful? How is it useful? Externalizing conversations\nRelatice influence questions Who's in charge, the person or the problem? Identifying unique outcomes Reading between the lines of the problem story\nCan you remember a time... Reauthoring What does it say about you... Illuminating or creating the counter-story\nReinforcing the new story Finding audiences, supportive witnesses, allies\nLetter writing Deconstructing destructive cultural assumptions Listen to stories as stories.\nBe attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story.\nAsk about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationship.\nMake sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem.'\nUnless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences.\nAt some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories.\nTry to put yourself in their shoes.\nDo not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them\nListen and ask\nListen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust. Listen 'deconstructively' to family stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings.\nAsk families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning.\nWe wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?\nAnd, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'? Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society/\nDevelop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work win the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult.\nThere are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play.\nDeconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that suppose them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses. The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem.\nExternalizing - problems are seen as separate from people.\nAs we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families. If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them. What would you call that something? What 'feeds' the problem?\nWhat 'starves' the problem?\nIn what settings might the problem be useful?\nWho advocates for the problem?\nWhat groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?\nWhat are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships? Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it.\nAs we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem.\nWhat are the family's preferred directions?\n'Standing against' the problem. Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes? Is the problem always with you? Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives.\nDouble listening. If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled.\nIf a person experiences injustive, they must have a conception of a just world.\nWhen we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications. Stories need listeners as well as tellers.\nAttentive witnesses.\nThe therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful.\nWhat was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?\nWhat thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking? It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions. Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?\nWhat did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them? Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who then amplify and accredit the stories that they witness. What stood out for them?\nWhat images it brought forward?\nHow it resonated with their own experiences?\nWhere they were transported by the interview?\nSituate their reflections in their own experience.\nComment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives. We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive. We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop. We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud. We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems. We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions. In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session. Our intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session. We might invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives. Opening space questions (unique outcomes) Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but didn't? Preference questions (preferred experiences) Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how? Story development questions How is this different from when arguing is in control? Meaning questions What does it say about you that you were able to...? Questions that extend the story into the future What do you predict...? Aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. Reality is socially constructed.\nReality is influenced by and communicated through language.\nHaving a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality.\nThere is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. Telling One's Story: A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. Externalization Technique: Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. Deconstruction Technique: This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. Unique Outcomes Technique: To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that doesn't include your most pervasive problems. Some families prefer a different kind of therapy than narrative, some are seeking instruction and expert advice.\nRegularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship.

Derived from MRI\nFocus on cognitions rather than behavior\nFocus on the presenting the problem Find the simplest solution Focus on exceptions Exceptions to client's problem are the solution Assumed people are capable of behaving effectively; blocked by negative mindset\nPeople already have the solution(s) to their problems.\nPeople constrained by narrow view of their problems. Rigid patterns of false solutions Future-oriented Look to future where problems can be solved. Changing the way people talk about their problems. The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. Problem talk: Negative\nFocuses on the past\nImplies permanence of problems Solution talk: Hopeful\nFuture oriented Avoid judgements about 'what is normal'\nClients as experts in their situation\nInterest in language How people describe themselves and problems Focus on complaints presented Should not impose values by suggesting clients address other un-presented problems. Solutions to problems are unrelated to the development of the problem. Tracking the development of the problem should be avoided. Problem-focused thinking prevents effective solutions from being recognized. Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. Resolve presenting complaint by helping clients do or think differently. Trust clients to reach their own goals. Help clients identify the problem-solving skills they have lost sight of. Help clients locate their resources. Time limited\nSessions are made one at a time\nOne may be enough\nTypical course includes 3-5 sessions\nClients can return as-needed\nOften a week to a few weeks apart\nOnce you know more of what works, do more of it Consultant\nDon't get bogged down in 'problem talk'\nDirect clients away from the problem-saturated narrative\nTherapists attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding\nFocus on the 'here and now'\nThe future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes\nAssumes a position of 'not knowing' Very little intake information\nAvoid assessing how problems develop\nConcentrate on assessing future goals\nTherapy should only include people concerned about the problem\nHear the client's constructions of their problems without preconceptions What do you think the problem is now?\nHow will you know when the problem is solved?\nHow will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?\nWhat will have to be different for that to happen in terms of your behavior, thoughts, and feelings?\nWhat will you notice that is different about others involved in the situation?\nWhat is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen? What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?\nWhat needs to happen so that this will not have been a waste of your time?\nOften in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today? Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the clients to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10. Where 1 represented the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone or the clients are coping so well that its no longer problematic Solution-focused therapists help clients identify their preferred solution by: Talking about the problem, exceptions, and desired outcomes.\nWorking with clients to take small active steps in this general direction each week. This can take 1-10 sessions or it may take years depending on the complexity of the case. How do we know when to stop meeting like this?\nGoals should be: Small\nSalient to clients\nConcrete, behavioral, measurable\nAchievable\nInvolve hard work\nStart of something\nInvolve new behaviors What will be present? What will be happening? Activates problem-solving mindset by giving people a vision of their goal.\nHelps clients to look beyond the problem to see what they really want Might not be the elimination of the problem but to be able to do things that the problem has been obstructing \"Suppose one night there is a miracle and while you are sleeping the problem that brought you into therapy is solved.\" How would you know?\nWhat would be different?\nWhat will you notice the next morning that will tell you there has been a miracle?\nWhat will your family member notice? Directs clients' attention to times when they did not have the problem and expand on exceptions. Helping families see that their problems have exceptions - times when they don't occur. Exceptions are solutions that families already have in their repertoire.\nFinding exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail; also since these exceptions just happened, it is more plausible they could happen again. When in the recent past might the problem have happened but didn't (or was less intense or more manageable)?\nWhat's different about those times when the problem doesn't happen? How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you? Punctuate with enthusiasm and support.\nWork to keep solution talk in the forefront.\nListen carefully for an exception by getting more details about it and congragulating the family on it. Connect the exception to the family's goals by asking how the goal would be reached if this exception were to occur more often. \"How did you manage that?\"\n\"What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?\"\n\"How come things aren't worse?\"\n\"What have you done to keep them from getting worse?\" Help therapist and clients talk about vague topics (e.g., depression) On a scale from 1 to 10, how sad do you feel? Help clients to set goals in a clear/manageable manner. What do you think you need to do to achieve a 3? To be effective, compliments should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work. Formula first-session task\nDo more of what works\nDo soemthing different\nGo slow\nDo the opposite\nThe prediction task Devote to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress. Inquire about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the clients' role in attaining it. What's better?\nWhat happened that you liked?\nTell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that. How did you keep things from getting worse?\nWhat's your idea about what might be helpful? How can we know when to stop meeting like this?\nWhat needs to be different in your life as a result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?

Families only use a fraction of the full range of behaviors available to them. Therapy allows the family to access a wider range of behaviors. Jackson's strategies are based on the premise that psychiatric problems resulted from the way people behave with each other. To discern functional interactions from dysfunctional ones is to understand problems in context. Even positive change can be a threat to the defensive order of things. Some therapists believed symptoms serve a purpose by some families needing a sick member, which leads to parents victimizing scapegoated children.

Generating change rather than generating insight. Circumventing resistance rather than dealing directly with it. People are always communicating.\nAll behavior is communicative\nOne cannot not communicate. All messages have report and command functions. Report = CONTENT = Information = WHAT IS SAID\nCommand = PROCESS = Underlying Relationship = HOW IT IS SAID Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life. BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as, how they view the problem, themselves, and each other. Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients being to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (positive feedback loops) that maintain an impasse. The rules or regularities of family interaction that operate to preserve family stability. The conservation aspect of family systems (similar to cybernetic concept of negative feedback). When a specific behavior within a system changes. When the rules of a system change. Rules are typically unspoken, and govern most behavior. When rules promote rigid attempted solutions, it isn't just the behavior, but the rule needs to change. <br>When a specific behavior within a system changes = <a data-href=\"First-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">First-Order Change</a>\n<br>When the rules of the system change = <a data-href=\"Second-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Second-Order Change</a> Families are stuck in a spiraling positive feedback loop. They make common sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums. The job is simply to get the family moving again. Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. MRI: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. Haley: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around). Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. MRI Group: Carefully defining the presenting problem and figuring out why it is perpetuated. Non-historic and symptom focused. Haley and Madanes: Examine behavioral sequences around the problem. Examine structural anomalies (weak parental hierarchies, cross-generational coalitions) Milan Group: Preliminary hypothesis tested using circular questioning (systemic explanations). Find the most motivated person in the system. Gain clear understanding of problem (symptom).\n\"What will be the first signs that things are getting better?\"\nInquire about attempted solutions. Observe and interrupt problem-maintaining sequences. Use therapeutic paradox. Family encourages depressed member to be sad so he feels less guilt for not being happy. The solution is to deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it should not be. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. Haley joins and interviews the entire family. Social Stage -&gt; Problem Stage -&gt; Interaction Stage -&gt; Goal-Setting Stage -&gt; Task-Oriented Stage Each family member should speak and introduce themselves. Therapist should ensure problems are not discussed until everyone can speak. Therapist should examine family seating arrangements to assess organization. Keep conclusions tentative. Shift to the therapy stage. Inquire why the family is there and what the problem is. Be general and ambiguous so the family can expand. Respect the family hierarchy to gain cooperation. Treat those who have power and influence in the family with respect. Therapist should not share observations with the family. Therapist should think of the problems in terms of more than one person. It is critical family members interact with one another rather than with the therapist. Therapist should redirect family members toward each other. Assess family organization through interactions. Families need to define desired changes. Therapist can act as wise advisor and assist the family in setting goals. Use of directives (interventions aimed at targeting and changing specific behaviors). Pre-Session, Session, Intersession, Intervention, Post-Session Discussion\nPositive connotation (reframing without blaming)\nCircular questioning\nTeam approach (Reflecting team, greek chorus)\nNeutrality Responsible for guidance of treatment. We are going to focus on what the problem is. Be aware of timing and pacing. Meet client where they are. Take the time (to form treatment plans) Respond to subtle pressure from clients. Avoid attempting interventions prematurely. Gather enough data about where the client is at before making attempts at intervention. Use of Qualifying Language: \"I have a suggestion to make, but I am not sure how much it will accomplish. It will depend on your ability to use your imagination...\" Getting client to be specific. Taking one-downmanship. The inherent power difference in therapy Determining the format of meeting. Individual vs. Conjoint\nIn what situation will individual session be beneficial? 'Window Shopper' Client: Re-negotiate contract\nWorking with the complainant\nGet them down to business Restrictive Client: Ask permission to redirect\nSetting specific boundary Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist to understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Never tell client why we do this. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about.\nSometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed they are instructed to make a list of all of the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. \"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation.\" (Piercy et al., 1996)\nReframes can be offered by asking circular questions: \"Who makes you depressed?\"\n\"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?\" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change.

Report = CONTENT = Information = WHAT IS SAID\nCommand = PROCESS = Underlying Relationship = HOW IT IS SAID Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life. BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as, how they view the problem, themselves, and each other. Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. The problems clients being to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (positive feedback loops) that maintain an impasse. The rules or regularities of family interaction that operate to preserve family stability. The conservation aspect of family systems (similar to cybernetic concept of negative feedback). When a specific behavior within a system changes. When the rules of a system change. Rules are typically unspoken, and govern most behavior. When rules promote rigid attempted solutions, it isn't just the behavior, but the rule needs to change. <br>When a specific behavior within a system changes = <a data-href=\"First-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">First-Order Change</a>\n<br>When the rules of the system change = <a data-href=\"Second-Order Change\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Second-Order Change</a> Families are stuck in a spiraling positive feedback loop. They make common sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums. The job is simply to get the family moving again. Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. MRI: The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. Haley: Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around). Milan: Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. MRI Group: Carefully defining the presenting problem and figuring out why it is perpetuated. Non-historic and symptom focused. Haley and Madanes: Examine behavioral sequences around the problem. Examine structural anomalies (weak parental hierarchies, cross-generational coalitions) Milan Group: Preliminary hypothesis tested using circular questioning (systemic explanations). Find the most motivated person in the system. Gain clear understanding of problem (symptom).\n\"What will be the first signs that things are getting better?\"\nInquire about attempted solutions. Observe and interrupt problem-maintaining sequences. Use therapeutic paradox. Family encourages depressed member to be sad so he feels less guilt for not being happy. The solution is to deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it should not be. The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. Haley joins and interviews the entire family. Social Stage -&gt; Problem Stage -&gt; Interaction Stage -&gt; Goal-Setting Stage -&gt; Task-Oriented Stage Each family member should speak and introduce themselves. Therapist should ensure problems are not discussed until everyone can speak. Therapist should examine family seating arrangements to assess organization. Keep conclusions tentative. Shift to the therapy stage. Inquire why the family is there and what the problem is. Be general and ambiguous so the family can expand. Respect the family hierarchy to gain cooperation. Treat those who have power and influence in the family with respect. Therapist should not share observations with the family. Therapist should think of the problems in terms of more than one person. It is critical family members interact with one another rather than with the therapist. Therapist should redirect family members toward each other. Assess family organization through interactions. Families need to define desired changes. Therapist can act as wise advisor and assist the family in setting goals. Use of directives (interventions aimed at targeting and changing specific behaviors). Pre-Session, Session, Intersession, Intervention, Post-Session Discussion\nPositive connotation (reframing without blaming)\nCircular questioning\nTeam approach (Reflecting team, greek chorus)\nNeutrality Responsible for guidance of treatment. We are going to focus on what the problem is. Be aware of timing and pacing. Meet client where they are. Take the time (to form treatment plans) Respond to subtle pressure from clients. Avoid attempting interventions prematurely. Gather enough data about where the client is at before making attempts at intervention. Use of Qualifying Language: \"I have a suggestion to make, but I am not sure how much it will accomplish. It will depend on your ability to use your imagination...\" Getting client to be specific. Taking one-downmanship. The inherent power difference in therapy Determining the format of meeting. Individual vs. Conjoint\nIn what situation will individual session be beneficial? 'Window Shopper' Client: Re-negotiate contract\nWorking with the complainant\nGet them down to business Restrictive Client: Ask permission to redirect\nSetting specific boundary Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist to understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. Never tell client why we do this. The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about.\nSometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. As soon as a family member is overwhelmed they are instructed to make a list of all of the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. \"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation.\" (Piercy et al., 1996)\nReframes can be offered by asking circular questions: \"Who makes you depressed?\"\n\"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?\" Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change.

Structure is expressed through transactional patterns such as: <br><a data-href=\"Hierarchy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hierarchy</a> Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. <br><a data-href=\"Power\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/power.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Power</a>\nAlliances <br><a data-href=\"Structure\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Structure</a>: The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. The organized pattern in which families interact. <br><a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a>: Subsystems are often formed based on the patterns of interactions in a family. Patterns of interaction are largely based on roles and rules. Covert coalitions are often more significant than obvious groupings. Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. Children are common 'symptom bearers.'\nOrganization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems: Marital/Couple\nParental\nChild/Sibling <br><a data-href=\"Boundaries\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundaries</a> Each subsystems is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. <br><img alt=\"Media/School Diagrams/Symbols of Family Structure.png\" src=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/media/school-diagrams/symbols-of-family-structure.png\" target=\"_self\">\nRigid Boundaries (Disengaged Subsystem) <br>Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in <a data-href=\"Disengagement\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/disengagement.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Disengagement</a>.\nDisengaged systems are independent, but isolated.\nOn the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support. Diffuse Boundaries (Enmeshed Subsystem): <br>Diffuse boundaries are result in <a data-href=\"Enmeshment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enmeshment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enmeshment</a>.\nEnmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence.

Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system) <br><a data-href=\"Triangles\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/triangles.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Triangles</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Loyalties\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/loyalties.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Loyalties</a> Assumptions: The family could have developed a structure different from the dysfunctional one now being displayed. The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.\nThe consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. Families seek help for a specific problem. Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. Exploring dynamics of interaction. Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.\nThe model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. Theoretical Formulations: Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. But rather by a functioning structure Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. Problems arise when there are: Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions\nInflexible structures\nFailure to adjust to changing circumstances Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment. The ultimate goal of therapy is structural changes to the family Alter the family structure so that the family can solve its own problems. General goal: create or strengthen executive subsystem Therapists have two types of assessment tools: <br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> Spontaneous behavior sequences\nEnactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems\nTherapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences.

At Wiltwyck, Minuchin and his colleagues (Dick Auerswald, Charlie King, Braulio Montalvo, and Clara Rabinowitz) taught themselves to do family therapy, inventing it as they went along. <br>In 1962, Minuchin met <a data-href=\"Jay Haley\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jay Haley</a> at <a data-href=\"Palo Alto (1952)\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/palo-alto-(1952).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Palo Alto (1952)</a>.

To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. To understand these patterns, two things are necessary: A theoretical system that explains structure\nSeeking the family in action Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. Rigid boundaries: Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. Clear Boundary: Normal range. Diffuse Boundaries: Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. <br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href=\"Accommodation\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href=\"Boundary Making\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boundary Making</a>. The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem. Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - \"The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family.\" Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. <br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href=\"Cross-Generational Coalition\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>. Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. <br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href=\"Joining\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. \"Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them.\" Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps: Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.\nHelp family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist: Joins the family in a position of leadership.\nMaps the family's underlying structure.\nIntervenes to transform this structure. In general, structural family therapy follows these steps: Joining and accommodating\nEnactment\nStructural Mapping\nHighlighting and Modifying Interactions\nBoundary Making\nUnbalancing\nChallenging Unproductive Assumptions Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up. Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. Working with enactments requires three operations: The therapist notices a problematic sequence. The therapist initiates an enactment. The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways: Commenting on what went wrong\nPushing them to keep going Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. <br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href=\"Intensity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Intensity</a>. Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. <br><a data-href=\"Coalition\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coalition</a>:\nIntensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. <br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href=\"Empathy\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. <br><a data-href=\"Shaping Competence\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shaping Competence</a> Another method of modifying interactions. Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. A sense of timing helps. In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. <br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href=\"Complementarity\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Complementarity</a>. In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. Example: Families of the Slums by Minuchin Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions. The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. Subsystems are units of the family based on function. Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves. <br>Family is depicted as a system that comprised of <a data-href=\"Subsystem\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsystem</a>.

The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. Theoretical Formulations: Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. But rather by a functioning structure Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. Problems arise when there are: Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions\nInflexible structures\nFailure to adjust to changing circumstances Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment. The ultimate goal of therapy is structural changes to the family Alter the family structure so that the family can solve its own problems. General goal: create or strengthen executive subsystem Therapists have two types of assessment tools: <br><a data-href=\"Enactment\" href=\"https://millielynnash.github.io/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enactment</a> Spontaneous behavior sequences\nEnactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems\nTherapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences.
