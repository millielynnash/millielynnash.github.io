- Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia
	- Emphasized theory
	- Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of [[Differentiation of Self]] (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of [[Triangle]] s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).
	- Beginning in 1955, when Bowen started bringing family members together to discuss their problems, he was struck by their [[Emotional Reactivity]]. Feelings overwhelmed reason. Bowen felt families’ tendency to pull him into the center of this [[Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass]], and he had to make a concerted effort to remain objective (Bowen, 1961). The ability to remain neutral and focus on the process, rather than content, of family discussions is what distinguishes a therapist from a participant in a family’s drama.
	- To control the level of emotion, Bowen encouraged family members to talk to him, not to each other
	- therapists weren’t immune to being sucked into family conflicts
	- Whenever two people are struggling with conflict they can’t resolve, there is an automatic tendency to involve a third party
		- [[Triangle]]:
			- Triangle is the smallest stable unit of relationship
			- Process of complaining to third party means less likely to address the problem at its source
			- Triangling process is destructive when it becomes regular feature of a relationship
				- Repeating what someone says to you about someone else is one way to stop triangling in its tracks
			- Triangles spread out
		- Bowen Family Life:
			- In 1966 an emotional crisis in Bowen’s family led to a personal voyage of discovery that turned out to be as significant for Bowen’s theory as Freud’s self-analysis was for psychoanalysis.
			- Bowen, the oldest of five children from a tightly knit rural family, kept his distance from his parents and the rest of his extended family. Like many of us, he mistook avoidance for emancipation.
				- Unfinished emotional business stays with us, making us vulnerable to repeat conflicts we never worked out with our families
			- Bowen’s most important achievement was detriangling himself from his parents, who’d been accustomed to complaining to him about each other
		- [[Differentiation of Self]]:
			- Best accomplished by developing personal relationships with as many members of the family as possible.
			- Differentiating one's self from the family is completed when these relationships are maintained without becoming emotionally reactive or taking part in [[Triangle]]s.
