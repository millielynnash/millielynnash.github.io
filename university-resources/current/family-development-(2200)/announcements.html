As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state’s history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://mozartscafe.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://mozartscafe.com/" target="_self">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart’s brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This "taste of Austria" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most "brilliantly illuminated city in the country." Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days.

Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!!

On the first day of classes in September 1873, the students entered an unfinished University Hall. This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today’s University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today’s University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976.

This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks.

Originally, there was no formal plan for an Oval. The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps “The Five Brothers,” which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" target="_self">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Announcements-7.png" src="university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="Announcements-7.png" src="university-resources/ohio-state-history/ohio-state-pictures/announcements-7.png" target="_self"></span><br>
Anthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony’s dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony’s son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony’s Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father. Realizing&nbsp;the quality of the candy was creating a demand, Tom and his father decided to make it a full time trade, and using their first names they formed the Anthony-Thomas Candy Company in 1952.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Astounding Activities: The Scioto Deer&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Announcements-8.png" src=".html" class="internal-embed is-loaded file-embed mod-empty-attachment" target="_self">“Announcements-8.png” could not be found.</span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You may have probably seen at least one of the three bronze deer sculptures located throughout Columbus, but do you know why they’re actually there?

Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don’t worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I hope you all have a great week.

It is very fitting to choose this wonderful place as our topic for Columbus Lore. The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Announcements-9.png" src=".html" class="internal-embed is-loaded file-embed mod-empty-attachment" target="_self">“Announcements-9.png” could not be found.</span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" target="_self">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn’s products.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Astounding Activities:&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Announcements-10.png" src=".html" class="internal-embed is-loaded file-embed mod-empty-attachment" target="_self">“Announcements-10.png” could not be found.</span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" target="_self">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape.

Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Warmest regards,</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Millie Lynn Ash</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Happy Tuesday everyone!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life.
