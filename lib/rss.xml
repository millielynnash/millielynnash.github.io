<br><br>Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents’ development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n = 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difﬁculties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These ﬁndings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.<br><br>

<br>Theory:

<br>Describe the following elements of the Satir model and emotionally focused therapy:

<br>Process of therapy
<br>Therapeutic relationship
<br>Case conceptualization
<br>Goal setting
<br>Interventions




<br>Case Conceptualization and Treatment Plan

<br>Complete a theory-specific case conceptualizations and treatment plans for Satir family therapy and emotionally focused couples therapy using templates that are provided. 


<br>Research

<br>Provide an overview of significant research findings for Satir family therapy and emotionally focused couples therapy. 


<br>Diversity

<br>Analyze strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications for using experiential approaches with clients in relation to their social location/diverse identities, including but not limited to ethnic, racial, and/or sexual/gender identity diversity. 


<br>Cross-Theoretical Comparison

<br>Compare how experiential therapies utilize interpersonal patterns (IPs) with other approaches described in this book. 


<br><br>
<br>Integrating systemic theory with humanism, experiential family therapists are noted for their warmth and direct emotional engagement with clients. These approaches include:

<br>The Satir Model

<br>EFT integrates experiential, systemic, and attachment theories to help couples and families create emotional safety to foster wellness interaction patterns.

<br><br><br>
<br>Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. 
<br>Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. 
<br>Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. 
<br>This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. 
<br>In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated.

<br>Her therapy focused on fostering individual growth as well as improving family interactions.

<br>The <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a> in the Satir model offer a clinician an efficient and effect means of conceptualizing how best to communicate and interact with the client. 
<br>She describes 4 communication survival or coping stances:

<br>These stances develop in childhoodand reveal how a person communicates under stress, especially when they do not feel emotionally safe in intimate relationships. 
<br>A person can use more than one, but typically a person uses one style predominantly. 
<br>Each stance acknowledges or minimizes three basic realities:

<br>Self
<br>Other
<br>Context


<br>The goal is to move people toward <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication in which they respectfully balance the needs of self and others while responding appropriately within and acknowledging the context . 
<br><img alt="Congruent Communication Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/congruent-communication-diagram.png">
<br><br>
<br>Each survival stance minimizes one or more essential part of the total picture. 
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Placator Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/placator-stance-diagram.png">
<br>Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. 
<br>Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. 

<br>Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. 


<br>Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. 
<br>Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. 
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/blamer-stance-diagram.png">
<br>Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
<br>With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. 
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png">
<br>When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. 
<br>Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. 
<br>The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others.
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png">
<br>A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. 
<br>The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. 
<br>Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. 
<br>As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. 
<br>Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently.

<br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a>

<br>She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 
<br>1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program.


<br><br>
<br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. 

<br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. 


<br>The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. 
<br>Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. 
<br>The six-stages:

<br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>

<br>This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. 


<br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a>

<br>May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. 


<br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a>

<br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. 


<br><a data-href="Integration of New Possibilities" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Integration of New Possibilities</a>

<br>Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. 


<br>Practice

<br>The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. 
<br>This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions:

<br>Are the symptoms improving?
<br>Is each person able to self-actualize and grow?




<br>New Status Quo

<br>This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. 




<br>Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Four primary assumptions about people and therapy:

<br>People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
<br>All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
<br>Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
<br>Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle).


<br>These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works:

<br>Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. 


<br>The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. 
<br><br>
<br>Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities:

<br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness
<br>Accurate <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>
<br>Unconditional Positive Regard


<br>These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. 

<br>This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. 
<br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. 


<br><br>
<br>Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. 
<br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. 
<br>The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. 
<br>The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels':

<br>Mind
<br>Body
<br>Spirit
<br>Open body position and congruent communication are critical. 


<br>Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. 
<br>The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. 

<br>When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. 


<br>Making contact involves:

<br>Making direct eye contact
<br>Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
<br>Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
<br>Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called


<br><br>
<br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. 
<br>Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
<br>Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. 
<br>Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed")

<br>Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. 


<br><br>
<br>In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. 
<br>Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. 
<br><br>
<br>Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. 
<br>Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). 
<br><br>
<br>Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed.

<br><br>
<br>Satir viewed the symptom as having a role in the family system. 
<br>Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. 
<br>Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)?

<br>If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. 


<br><br>
<br>Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics:

<br>Power Struggles

<br>These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. 


<br>Parental Conflicts

<br>These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. 


<br>Lack of Validation

<br>The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. 


<br>Lack of Intimacy

<br>There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. 




<br><br>
<br>Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem. 
<br>Possible roles include:

<br><a data-href="Martyr" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Martyr" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Martyr</a>
<br><a data-href="Victim or Helpless One" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Victim or Helpless One" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Victim or Helpless One</a>

<br><br>
<br>The family life chronology is a timeline that includes the major events in an individual's or family's life. 

<br>Births and deaths
<br>Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
<br>Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns)


<br>This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. 
<br><br>
<br>Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. 
<br>Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. 
<br>Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child?

<br>Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. 


<br><br>
<br>One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. 
<br>These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
<br>At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. 
<br>The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. 
<br>Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. 
<br>The six layers of the iceberg:

<br>Behavior

<br>The behavior on the surface; the external manifestations of the person's inner world.

<br>These come out in times of stress, and a person may use different stances in different relational contexts. 


<br>Feelings

<br>Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. 
<br>Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. 


<br>Perceptions

<br>Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality).


<br>Expectation

<br>A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). 


<br>Yearnings

<br>Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. 
<br>This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. 




<br>Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. 

<br>By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. 


<br><br>
<br>It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. 
<br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. 

<br>People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.'


<br>The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. 

<br>Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. 


<br>As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions. 
<br><br>
<br>The mind-body connection considers how emotional issues may manifest in the body, either symbolically or functionally. 
<br>The role of nutrition and exercise is assessed.

<br>Hyper and distracted




<br><br>
<br>The goal of Satir's model is transformation:

<br>To achieve optimal realization of a person's full potential. 
<br>This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning:

<br>Relational, family, or systemic goals
<br>Individual goals




<br><br>
<br>The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication:

<br>The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. 


<br>The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. 
<br><br>
<br>Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. 
<br>Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. 
<br><br>
<br>The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches:

<br>To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. 
<br>By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. 
<br>The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. 
<br><br>
<br>The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. 
<br>The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. 
<br>When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.'

<br>What do I HEAR and SEE?

<br>The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. 
<br>This is similar to ' <a data-href="videotalk" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/videotalk" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href="Solution-Focused Therapy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. 


<br>What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see?

<br>After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. 
<br>Meanings often connect back to past experiences. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make?

<br>The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. 
<br>Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS?

<br>The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. 
<br>The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. 
<br>If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: "I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural."; incongruent: "I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.")
<br>Subsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. 


<br>What DEFENSES do I use?

<br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>. 


<br>What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use?

<br>Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'
<br>Most of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. 
<br>These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques'


<br>What is my RESPONSE in the situation?

<br>How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?
<br>Incongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change. 




<br><br>
<br>Satir therapists work with clients to help them express difficult-to-articulate emotions related to the presenting problem. 
<br>If the clients complain about family members or a difficult life situation, experiential therapists listen closely for the emotions, expressed or unexpressed, that are related to the problem circumstance. 

<br>They listen not just for the surface emotions, but also for deeper levels of emotion and use questions and empathetic reflections to focus clients on those deeper emotions. 


<br><br>
<br>If a client tells a story without identifying their emotions directly:

<br>"As I listen to you explain what happened to you during that argument, I am getting a sense that you were feeling [name the emotion]. Does that sound right?"
<br>"That sounds like a very difficult situation. Can you share some of the emotions you have been expeirencing as you go through this?"


<br>If a client does identify emotions, the therapy can help explore them with questions such as:

<br>"You say you were feeling [emotion]. I am wondering if part of you is also feeling [name another emotion that client seems to be experiencing]."
<br>"Can you say more about what feeling [name emotion] feels like for you."


<br><br>
<br>Satir coached families in softening rigid family rules by changing them to guidelines.

<br>For example, rather than saying "I should not get angry," a client or family was encouraged to revise the limiting rule to "What I am angry, I will express my anger in a way that is respectful to others and myself."


<br>Satir encouraged families to have as few rules as possible and to be flexible, adapting them for each context and as children's developmental needs change. 
<br><br>
<br>Coaching clients in how to have authentic, congruent communication in session, involves the ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' combined with specific communication coaching strategies. 
<br>When coaching communication, Satir had clients turn their chairs toward one another and gave the clients prompts, such as, "Tell your partner how you feel about what happened on Saturday night."

<br>If the client was able to congruently address their partner about this, Satir then prompted the partner to respond in kind, continuing this process until the problem was resolved. 


<br>When a person had trouble communicating congruently and reverted to a survival stance, Satir interrupted the conversation and suggested how to rephrase the statement or how to make the client's nonverbal communication more congruent (e.g., "Now, can you say that starting the statement with 'I' instead of 'you'?" or "Can you show me the emotion you say you are feeling when you speak to your wife?")
<br>The ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' technique was used to help coach clients through what they heard and saw, how they interpreted and felt about it, and the feelings about feelings and family-of-origin rules for communicating about what happened. 
<br><br>
<br>Family <a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>, which is done either with the family or in a group setting. 
<br>Sculpting involves putting family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family. 
<br>Either the therapist or the client may direct the sculpting. 

<br>If family members are directing the sculpting, each person in the family is given the opportunity to sculpt the family as they see it. 
<br>Sometimes the sculptor assigns each family member to say a line that represents how they may be feeling, thinking, or viewing the situation. 
<br>Usually, however, the essence of this intervention is to give a nonverbal, symbolic depiction of the family process from each person's perspective. 


<br>Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses. 

<br>Through the sculpting process, a person is able to literally see how they are contributing to the problematic family process far more quickly than when the same information is provided with words. 


<br>When all family members are sculpting, it is generally best to let all family members sculpt how they see the family before allowing discussion of one another's sculpting. 
<br>Therapists encourage family members to respect each person's subjective experience as illustrated in the sculpting and to use the experience to deepen their understanding of one another. 
<br><br>
<br>Satir used touch in therapy to initially connect with clients and to encourage and reassure them when they were practicing new ways of communicating. 

<br>In this way, she underscored emotional context and provided palpable support. 


<br>She also used touch with children to help teach alternatives to violent behavior and to model for parents how to manage difficult children. 
<br>In today's practicing environments, touching is generally discouraged because it can easily be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or may make a client feel uncomfortable. 

<br>Therapists need to carefully consider the legal and ethical issues of using touch. 
<br>Touch may be appropriate in certain practice and cultural contexts. 
<br>At minimum, therapists can learn from Satir the importance of coaching clients in touching each other - their children and spouses - in more loving and helpful ways. 

<br>For example, rather than using a demonstration, therapists can guide a parent on how to hold children who are having a tantrum. 




<br><br><br>
<br>A form of psychodrama, the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> is used to allow clients to explore unresolved family issues and life events in the safety of the group setting. 
<br>The client, who is called the ' <a data-href="Star" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Star</a> ,' first identifies key events in their life chronology and significant sources of influence.

The therapist facilitates the reenactment with the following three goals in mind:

<br>Identifying the roots of old learning and their role in the present.
<br>Developing a more realistic picture of the client's parents. 
<br>Discovering unique strengths and potentials. 


<br><br>
<br>A group activity similar to the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a>, the <a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a> involves the client identifying group members to represent aspects of the self. 
<br>The person may have members enact generic characteristics (<a data-href="Martyr" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Martyr" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Martyr</a>, <a data-href="Victim or Helpless One" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Victim or Helpless One" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Victim or Helpless One</a>, savior) or use famous figures to represent different aspects of the self. 

<br>In this way, the therapist facilitates a process in which the client is better able to accept different aspects of the self and to identify the contexts in which these aspects have been and continue to be useful. The language of 'parts' can also be used to facilitate similar discussions and insights in individual, couples, and family therapy. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Satir's approach tracks pathologizing interpersonal patterns (PIPs) with a specific focus on the emotional level of the interaction and adds to it an understanding of the intrapsychic experiences within each person. 
<br>The <a data-href="Iceberg Model" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/iceberg-model.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Iceberg Model</a> (<a data-href="Six Levels of Experience" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/six-levels-of-experience.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Six Levels of Experience</a>) helps therapists assess the internal PIPs that are part of the external PIP with others.

<br><br>
<br>In the Satir's model, wellness interpersonal patterns (WIPs) are conceptualized in terms of congruent communication (relationally) and self-worth (intrapersonally). These can take the form of listening compassionately/sharing vulnerability or acknowledging self/appreciating self.

<br>When facilitating change, the therapist uses several forms of transformational interaction patters (TIPs). 

<br>Family <a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a> takes the form of having everyone first sculpt the PIP and then having each person sculpt their desired WIPs. 
<br>When working more intrapsychically, the <a data-href="Iceberg Model" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/iceberg-model.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Iceberg Model</a> is used to identify both PIPs and WIPs as well, first identifying the negative inner monologue dialogue patterns (disapproving of self/disapproving of others) and then identifying alternatives (approving of self/approving of others). 
<br>Much of the family-of-origin work that characterize this approach involve healing interpersonal patterns (HIPs), especially the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> and <a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>; this typically done by having another group member say what she always wished her parents would have said.

<br>The Undeclared War:

<br>We came to think of asylums as places of cruelty and detention, they were originally built to rescue the insane from being locked away in family attics.
<br>Therapists began to notice that often when a patient got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member.
<br>Patients often improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home.
<br>Parents use their children as a buffer to protect them from intimacy.


<br>Small Group Dynamics:

<br>Group dynamics were applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group.
<br>The Group Mind (1920) (McDougall)

<br>A group’s continuity depends on boundaries for differentiation of function and on customs and habits to make relationships predictable.


<br>Field theory by <a data-href="Kurt Lewin" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/kurt-lewin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kurt Lewin</a>. He developed the notion that a group is more than the sum of its parts. 
<br>Quasi-stationary social equilibrium: changing group behavior requires ‘unfreezing.’ Only after something shakes up group’s beliefs will its members be prepared to change. In individual therapy this process is initiated by the unhappy experiences that lead people to seek help.
<br>More effort is required to unfreeze, or shake up, families before real change can take place. The need for unfreezing foreshadowed early family therapists’ concern about disrupting family homeostasis.
<br><a data-href="Wilfred Bion (1948)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/wilfred-bion-(1948).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wilfred Bion (1948)</a>:
<br>Fight-flight, dependency, and pairing:

<br>Some families skirt around hot issues like a cat circling a snake. Others use therapy to bicker endlessly, never really contemplating compromise, much less change.
<br>Dependency masquerades as therapy when families allow therapists to subvert their autonomy in the name of problem solving.
<br>Pairing is seen in families when one parent colludes with the children to undermine the other parent.


<br>Process/Content:

<br>Experienced therapists learn to attend as much to how people talk as to the content of their discussions.


<br><a data-href="Role Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/role-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Role Theory</a>: the expectations that roles carry bring regularity to complex social situations. Such roles can be hard to put aside.

<br>The New Peoplemaking (1988) <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a>

<br>Describes family roles such as 'placator' or 'disagreeable one'


<br>Roles tend to be stereotyped in most groups, and so there are characteristic behavior patterns of group members.
<br>Roles tend to be complementary. Eventually parents of misbehaving children may become polarized into complementary roles of strictness and leniency. What makes such reciprocity resistant to change is that the roles reinforce each other.
<br>Group and family therapy are similar: Both are complex and dynamic, more like everyday life than individual therapy. In groups and families, patients must react to a number of people, not just a therapist, and therapeutic use of this interaction is the definitive mechanism of change in both contexts.
<br>It turns out that the differences between families and groups are so significant that the group therapy model has only limited applicability to family treatment. 
<br>Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy very different from group therapy.
<br>This feeling of safety among sympathetic strangers cannot be part of family therapy because instead of separating treatment from a stressful environment, the stressful environment is brought into the consulting room.




<br><a data-href="The Child Guidance Movement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/The Child Guidance Movement" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Child Guidance Movement</a>:

<br>It was Freud who introduced the idea that psychological disorders were the result of unsolved problems of childhood. Alfred Adler was the first of Freud's followers to pursue the implication that treating the growing child might be the most effective way to prevent adult neuroses.
<br>Child guidance workers concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms.

<br>Hypothesized family stability is achieved by feedback that regulates the behavior of the family and its members.

<br>Introduced concept of <a data-href="Double Bind" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/double-bind.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Double Bind</a>.

<br>Patients were not crazy in some meaningless way; they were an extension of a crazy family environment. Consider someone in an important relationship in which escape isn't feasible and response is necessary.
<br>Features of <a data-href="Double Bind" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/double-bind.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Double Bind</a>:

<br>Two or more individuals in an important relationship.
<br>Repeated experience.
<br>A primary negative injunction, such as "Don't do X, or I will punish you."
<br>A second injunction at a more abstract level conflicting with the first, also enforced by punishment or perceived threat.
<br>A tertiary negative injunction prohibiting escape and demanding a response. Without this restriction the victim won't feel bound. 
<br>Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer necessary once the victim is conditioned to perceive the world in terms of double binds; any part of the sequence becomes sufficient to trigger panic or rage.


<br>Most examples of double binds in literature are inadequate because they do not include all the critical features. 

<br>An example of a double bind would be a teacher who urges his students to participate in class but gets impatient if one of them actually interrupts with a question or comment. 


<br>A schizophrenic has to deal with them continually - and the effect is maddening. Unable to comment on the dilemma, the schizophrenic responds defensively, perhaps by being concrete and literal, perhaps by speaking in metaphors. Eventually, the schizophrenic may come to assume that behind every statement lies a concealed meaning. 


<br>The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families cause schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for the tragedy of their children's psychoses.

<br>Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia

<br>Emphasized theory
<br>Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).
<br>Beginning in 1955, when Bowen started bringing family members together to discuss their problems, he was struck by their <a data-href="Emotional Reactivity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-reactivity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Reactivity</a>. Feelings overwhelmed reason. Bowen felt families’ tendency to pull him into the center of this <a data-href="Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/undifferentiated-family-ego-mass.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass</a>, and he had to make a concerted effort to remain objective (Bowen, 1961). The ability to remain neutral and focus on the process, rather than content, of family discussions is what distinguishes a therapist from a participant in a family’s drama.
<br>To control the level of emotion, Bowen encouraged family members to talk to him, not to each other
<br>therapists weren’t immune to being sucked into family conflicts
<br>Whenever two people are struggling with conflict they can’t resolve, there is an automatic tendency to involve a third party

<br>Triangle is the smallest stable unit of relationship
<br>Process of complaining to third party means less likely to address the problem at its source
<br>Triangling process is destructive when it becomes regular feature of a relationship

<br>Repeating what someone says to you about someone else is one way to stop triangling in its tracks


<br>Triangles spread out


<br>Bowen Family Life:

<br>In 1966 an emotional crisis in Bowen’s family led to a personal voyage of discovery that turned out to be as significant for Bowen’s theory as Freud’s self-analysis was for psychoanalysis.
<br>Bowen, the oldest of five children from a tightly knit rural family, kept his distance from his parents and the rest of his extended family. Like many of us, he mistook avoidance for emancipation.

<br>Unfinished emotional business stays with us, making us vulnerable to repeat conflicts we never worked out with our families


<br>Bowen’s most important achievement was detriangling himself from his parents, who’d been accustomed to complaining to him about each other

<br>Families may give the appearance of unity, but underneath they are split into competing factions.

<br>1943; he and John Warkentin, working in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, began to include spouses and eventually children in treatment. 
<br>Whitaker also pioneered the use of co-therapy, in the belief that a supportive partner helped free therapists to react without fear of countertransference. 
<br>In the Therapy Room:

<br>Never seemed to have an obvious strategy nor did he use predictable techniques. 
<br>Let his unconscious run the therapy. 
<br>All interventions promoted flexibility. 
<br>Challenged family to open up - to become more fully themselves and more fully together. 


<br>Whitaker organized series of forums that eventually led to the first major convention of the family therapy movement. Beginning in 1946, Whitaker and his colleagues began twice-yearly conferences during which they observed and discussed one another's work with families.

<br>Mutual observation and using one-way mirrors became one of the hallmarks of family therapy.

<br>Leading influence on the decade of strategic therapy was exerted by Milton Erickson.

<br>Instead of grasping the principles on which they were predicated, many therapists just tried to imitate his “uncommon techniques.”
<br>To be any kind of competent therapist, you must keep your psychological distance from the supreme artists - the Minuchins, the Milton Ericksons, the Michael Whites. Otherwise you end up aping the magic of their styles rather than grasping the substance of their ideas.

<br>Appeal of Approach:

<br>Pragmatism
<br>Making use of the cybernetic metaphor, strategic therapists zeroed in on how family systems were regulated by negative feedback. They achieved results simply by disrupting the interactions that maintained symptoms. 


<br>Limitations:

<br>The Postmodern Revolution:

<br>Postmodernism:

<br>family therapy models all had one thing in common: They each assumed there were certain “truths” about families and systems. Each model has embedded within it certain assumptions about the good life: what families should look like, how people should feel and act, and so forth




<br>Conclusion:

<br>Minuchin assumed that the hierarchical structure of a healthy family looked a certain way—parent(s) in charge, establishing order and providing for the family, while children remain subordinate, accommodating to family rules.
<br>Bowen’s ideal family consisted of differentiated individuals, each simultaneously free to pursue their own growth and development while at the same time honoring their commitments to support one another

<br><br>
<br>The first and perhaps most influential model of how families operate was cybernetics, the study of feedback mechanisms in self-regulating systems.

<br>What a family shares with other cybernetic systems is a tendency to maintain stability by using information about its performance.
<br><a data-href="Feedback Loop" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/feedback-loop.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Feedback Loop</a>

<br>The process by which a system gets the information necessary to maintain a steady course. This feedback includes information about the system’s performance and the relationship among the system’s parts

<br>Includes information about the system's performance and the relationship among the system's parts. 
<br>If you see behavior that persists over time, there is likely something maintaining that behavior
<br>Feedback loops can be negative or positive, or the effect they have on homeostasis, not whether they are beneficial.
<br><a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>

<br>Negative feedback indicates that a system is straying off the mark and that corrections

<br>A familiar example of negative feedback occurs in a home heating system.
<br>Early family therapists tended to overemphasize negative feedback and resistance to change.

<br>Reinforces the direction a system is taking. 
<br>Positive feedback can have desirable or undesirable consequences. If left unchecked, the reinforcing effects of positive feedback tend to compound a system's errors, leading to a runaway process. 

<br>Malignant worry, phobic avoidance, and other forms of neurotic behavior may start out with a relatively trivial concern and escalate into an out-of-control process. 

<br>Example: a panic attack may start out as a relatively harmless instance of being out of breath, but a panicky response to breathlessness may spiral into a terrifying experience.  






<br>Feedback loops indicate a basic circularity where each element has an effect on the next, until the last element 'feeds back' the cumulative effect into the first part of the cycle. Thus A affects B, which in turn affects C, which feeds back to A, and so on. 


<br>To survive and adapt to the world around them, all communication systems - including families - need a balance of negative and positive feedback. 
<br>The cybernetic system turned out to be a useful metaphor for describing how families maintain stability.


<br><br>
<br>Cybernetics was the brainchild of MIT mathematician Norbert Weiner (1948).

<br>During WWII, Weiner was asked to design a better way to control the targeting of antiaircraft artillery. Weiner's solution was to incorporate a system of internal feedback that enabled antiaircraft guns to regulare their own operations. The signal used to control the artillery was a self-regulating servomechanism - the technical term for the first automated machines.
<br>He distinguish two modes of information, discrete or continuous - digital or analog.

<br>Basic change in the structure and functioning of a system. 


<br><br>
<br>Part of their appeal was a pragmatic, problem-solving focus, but there was also a fascination with strategies to outwit and provoke families into changing, with or without their cooperation.

<br>It was this manipulativeness that eventually turned people against strategic therapy. 


<br>The strategic approach introduced two of the most powerful insights in family therapy:

<br>Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions.
<br>Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. 


<br><br>
<br>Strategic therapy grew out of the <a data-href="Communications Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/communications-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communications Theory</a> developed at the Bateson's schizophrenia project, which evolved into three distinct models: the MRI brief therapy, Haley and Madane's strategic therapy, and the Milan systemic model. 

<br>The birthplace of all three was the Mental Research Institute (MRI), where strategic therapy was inspired by <a data-href="Gregory Bateson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/gregory-bateson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregory Bateson</a> and <a data-href="Milton Erikson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/milton-erikson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Milton Erikson</a>, the anthropologist and the alienist. 


<br>In 1952, funded by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study paradox in communication, Bateson invited <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, <a data-href="John Weakland" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/john-weakland.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">John Weakland</a>, and <a data-href="Don Jackson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Don Jackson</a> to join him in Palo Alto.

<br>In The Art of Psychoanalysis, Haley redefined psychoanalysis as a game of one-upmanship.


<br>In 1967 Haley joined Salvador Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
<br>In 1976 Haley moved to Washington DC with Cloe Madanes he founded the Family Therapy Institute. Madanes currently works with motivational speaker and life coach Anthony Robbins. In 1955 Haley moved back to California. He dies in 2007. 

<br>Jame Keim in California, who developed an innovative way of working with oppositional children, is ably carrying on the Haley-Madanes tradition. Other prominent practitioners of this model include Neil Schiffin Washington DC; Scott Sells at the Savannah Family Institute; and Jerome Price in Michigan. 


<br>The MRI model had a major impact on the Milan Associates, Mara Selvini Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo, Gianfranco Cecchin, and Guiliana Prata. 

<br>The Milan Associates eventually split, with Palazzoli and Prata focusing on invariant prescriptions and eventually incorporating more psycho analytic concepts into their work, and Boscolo and Cecchin focusing on circular questioning. Both groups currently have training centers in Italy. 
<br>Giorgio Nardone is another prominent Italian family therapist who trained at the MRI. 


<br><br>
<br>In Pragmatics of Human Communication Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson sought to develop a calculus of human communication, which they stated in a series of axioms. 

<br>People are always communicating. 

<br>Since all behavior is communicative and since one cannot not behave, then it follows that one cannot not communicate. 


<br>All messages have report and command functions.

<br>The report (or content) of a message conveys information, while the command is a statement about the relationship.

<br>Jackson's notion of family homeostasis describes the conservative aspect of family systems and is similar to the cybernetic concept of <a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>. 

<br>According to the communication analysis, families operate as goal-directed, rule-governed systems. 
<br>Communications theorists didn’t look for underlying motives; instead, they assumed circular causality and analyzed patterns of communications linked together in chains of stimulus and response as feedback loops. 

<br>When the response to a family member’s problematic behavior exacerbates the problem, that chain is seen as a positive feedback loop.
<br>The advantage of this formulation is that it focuses on interactions that perpetuate problems, which can be changed, instead of inferring underlying causes, which are often not subject to change.




<br><a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>:

<br>Strategic therapists made the concept of the positive feedback loop the centerpieve of the model. 

<br>For the MRI group, this translated into a simple yet powerful principle of problem formation:

<br>Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how family members respond to it. 

<br>Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This only produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, and so on - in a vicious cycle. 
<br>The family system is reacting to a deviation in the behavior of one of its members within feedback designed to dampen that deviation (<a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>), but has the effect of amplifying the deviation (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>).










<br>In most families, unspoken rules govern all sorts of behavior  

<br>Where a rule promotes the kind of rigid attempted solution described above, it is not just the behavior but the rule that needs to change. 
<br>When only a specific behavior within a system changes, this is <a data-href="First-Order Change" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">First-Order Change</a>

<br>Determine the rules that support those interactions

<br>Jay Haley added a functionalist emphasis to the cybernetic interpretation with his interest in the interpersonal payoff of behavior. Later, he incorporated structural concepts developed during the years he spent with Minuchin. 
<br><a data-href="Hierarchical Structure" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchical-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Structure</a>:

<br>Haley believed that the rules around the hierarchical structure of a family are crucial and found inadequate parental hierarchies lurking behind most problems. 

<br>Haley suggested that 'an individual is more disturbed in direct proportion to the number of malfunctioning hierarchies in which he is embedded.'

<br>To counter a problem's payoff, Haley borrowed Erickson's technique of <a data-href="Prescribing Ordeals" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/prescribing-ordeals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prescribing Ordeals</a>, so that the price for keeping a symptom outweighed that of giving it up. 






<br>Like Haley, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her associates focused on power games in families and on the protective function symptoms served for a family. 

<br>They explored families' histories over several generations, searching for evidence to confirm their hypotheses about how children's symptoms came to be necessary. These hypotheses often involved elaborate networks of family alliances and coalitions. 

<br>They frequently concluded that patients developed symptoms to protect one or more family members so as to maintain the delicate network of extended family alliances. 




<br><br>
<br>Strategic therapists say little more than whatever works is normal and that what makes families malfunction are solutions that don't work. 
<br><br>
<br>According to <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>, normal  families, like all living systems, depend on two processes:

<br>They maintain integrity in the face of environmental challenges through negative feedback. No living system can survive without a coherent structure. 

<br>Negative feedback resists disruptions


<br>Too rigid a structure leaves a system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. That is why normal families also have mechanisms of positive feedback.

<br>Positive feedback amplifies innovations to accommodate to changed circumstances. 


<br>Recognizing that the channel for feedback is communication makes it possible to state the case more plainly:

<br>Healthy families are able to adapt because they communicate clearly and are flexible.

<br>Resolutely opposed standards of normality.

<br>"As therapists, we do not regard any particular way of functioning, relating, or living as a problem if the client is not expressing discontent with it."


<br>By limiting their task to eliminating problems presented to them, they avoided taking any positions regarding how families should behave.

<br>Did not apply preconceived notions or normative models. By raising questions that helped families examine themselves and that exposed hidden power games, they trusted families to reorganize on their own.

<br>Assessments were based on assumptions about sound family functioning. His therapy was designed to help families reorganize into more functional structures, with clear boundaries and generational hierarchy. 


<br><br>
<br>According to communications theory, the essential function of symptoms is to maintain the homeostatic equilibrium of family systems. 

<br>Symptomatic families were seen as trapped in dysfunctional, homeostatic patterns of communication. 

<br>These families cling to their rigid ways and respond to signs of change as negative feedback. Change is treated not as an opportunity for growth but as a threat. 




<br>There are three explanations of how problems develop:

<br>Cybernetic:

<br>Difficulties are turned into chronic problems by misguided solutions, forming positive feedback escalations. 


<br>Structural:

<br>Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies.

<br>


<br>One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. 
<br>Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families usually seek help for a specific problem. 

<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. 


<br>What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions.

<br>To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. 

<br>Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. 


<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. 

<br>Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. 


<br>Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. 

<br>Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. 
<br>Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. 

<br>To understand these patterns, two things are necessary:

<br>A theoretical system that explains structure
<br>Seeking the family in action

<br>Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. 










<br>Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. 

<br>Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. 

<br>Rigid boundaries:

<br>Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. 


<br>Clear Boundary:

<br>Normal range.


<br>Diffuse Boundaries:

<br>Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. 






<br>Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. 

<br>The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. 

<br>Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. 


<br>Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. 

<br>The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. 

<br>A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. 

<br>Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. 


<br>In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. 








<br>Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. 
<br><br>
<br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. 

<br>The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. 
<br>In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. 


<br>Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. 

<br>Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. 


<br>Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. 
<br>The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem.

<br>Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. 


<br>Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. 

<br>Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. 

<br>Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. 




<br><br>
<br>Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. 

<br>Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. 

<br>In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. 

<br>If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. 


<br>In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. 

<br>Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. 

<br>A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family."






<br>Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. 


<br>Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. 

<br>One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. 
<br>An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. 

<br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>.




<br>Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. 

<br>If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. 

<br>Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. 




<br>Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. 

<br>The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. 


<br>An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. 

<br>Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. 


<br><br>
<br>Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. 
<br>The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. 
<br>Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. 

<br>Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. 


<br>Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. 
<br>With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. 
<br>With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. 
<br><br>
<br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. 

<br>To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. 

<br>Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. 




<br>The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. 
<br>Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. 
<br>Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. 

<br>It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. 


<br>Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. 
<br>Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. 

<br>"Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them."


<br>Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. 

<br>To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. 

<br>The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. 




<br>Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps:

<br>Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
<br>Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. 
<br>A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. 
<br>Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. 

<br>Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. 

<br>The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. 






<br><br>
<br>In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist:

<br>Joins the family in a position of leadership.
<br>Maps the family's underlying structure.
<br>Intervenes to transform this structure. 


<br>In general, structural family therapy follows these steps:

<br>Joining and accommodating
<br>Enactment
<br>Structural Mapping
<br>Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
<br>Boundary Making
<br>Unbalancing
<br>Challenging Unproductive Assumptions


<br><br>
<br>Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. 

<br>The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. 

<br>Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. 




<br>The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. 

<br>A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. 

<br>Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. 


<br>Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. 
<br>Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. 

<br>Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up.




<br><br>
<br>Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. 
<br>If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. 
<br>Working with enactments requires three operations:

<br>The therapist notices a problematic sequence. 
<br>The therapist initiates an enactment. 
<br>The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. 


<br>Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. 
<br>Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. 
<br>When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways:

<br>Commenting on what went wrong
<br>Pushing them to keep going


<br><br>
<br>Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. 
<br>Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. 

<br>It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. 


<br>Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. 
<br><br>
<br>Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. 
<br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>.

<br>Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. 


<br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
<br>Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. 

<br>Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. 


<br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. 

<br>Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. 


<br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a>

<br>Another method of modifying interactions. 
<br>Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. 

<br>A sense of timing helps. 




<br><br>
<br>In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. 
<br>Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. 
<br>Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. 

<br>When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. 


<br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>.
<br><br>
<br>In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. 
<br>Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - 
<br><br>
<br>Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. 
<br>Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. 
<br>Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. 
<br><br>
<br>Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. 
<br>Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. 

<br>Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. 

<br>These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. 




<br>The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. 

<br>The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. 


<br>Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. 
<br>Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. 

<br>Example:

<br>Families of the Slums by Minuchin




<br>Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. 

<br>Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. 


<br>Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. 
<br>Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. 

<br>Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. 


<br>Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. 

<br>A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. 


<br><br>
<br>The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions.
<br><br>
<br>The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. 

<br>Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. 


<br>Subsystems are units of the family based on function. 

<br>Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. 


<br>Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. 
<br>After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves.

<br>A system of rewards using points, which can be accumulated and exchanged for reinforcing items or behaviors.


<br>When they first began working with families, behavior therapists applied learning theory to train parents in behavior modification and teach communication skills to couples. 
<br><br>
<br>The early principles of behavior therapy were developed by two key figures: <a data-href="Joseph Wolpe" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/joseph-wolpe.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joseph Wolpe</a> and <a data-href="B. F. Skinner" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/b.-f.-skinner.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">B. F. Skinner</a>.

<br>In 1948, Wolpe introduced systematic desensitization.

<br>Systematic desensitization deconditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition by pairing responses incompatible with anxiety to previously anxiety-arousing stimuli. 


<br>Skinner's <a data-href="Operant Conditioning" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/operant-conditioning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Operant Conditioning</a>:

<br>Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.
<br>The operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. 
<br>Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change.

<br>Skills taught in sequence. 
<br>Teach parents to reinforce prosocial behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts. This process also promotes positive relationships between parents and children. Children earn rewards while they learn prosocial skills, and in the process, their self-esteem grows with their success and their parents' positive attention.

<br>Refers to those approaches inspired by the work of Albert Ellis (1962) and Aaron Beck (1976) that emphasize the need for attitude change to promote behavior modification.

<br>According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. 

<br>Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. 

<br>This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. 






<br>Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). 

<br>The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. 
<br>Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. 


<br>The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. 

<br>Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania.




<br><br>
<br>The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. 

<br>Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. 


<br>Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. 
<br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy.

<br>Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. 

<br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href="Schemas" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone.




<br><br>

<br>A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. 


<br>Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. 

<br>Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control.


<br>A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. 

<br>Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills.  


<br>Neil Jacobson (1981):

<br>Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. 


<br><br>
<br>Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. 
<br>People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. 

<br>Attention is a powerful social reinforcer.


<br>The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. 

<br>E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)
<br>Even when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.
<br>Others persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. 

<br>A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. 

<br>Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. 






<br>The use of <a data-href="Aversion Control" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. 

<br>People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills.


<br>Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease')

<br>Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. 


<br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up.

<br><br>
<br>Cognitive restructuring is useful to the extent that it leads to changed behavior, which can be reinforced. 
<br><br>
<br>The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. 
<br>Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. 

<br>Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. 


<br>Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. 
<br><br>
<br>The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. 

<br>The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. 

<br>Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. 




<br>The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. 

<br>Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. 
<br>Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out.

<br>Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. 


<br>Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy

<br>Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. 

<br>Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. 




<br>Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior.

<br>S for stimulus
<br>O for the state of the organism
<br>R for the target response
<br>KC for the contingency of consequences

<br>Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. 




<br>Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. 
<br><br>
<br>Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. 

<br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href="Premack Principle" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/premack-principle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premack Principle</a> is applied.

<br>High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. 

<br>As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. 






<br>Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. 

<br>The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. 
<br>Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. 

<br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. 

<br>Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. 


<br>When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. 




<br>Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. 

<br>Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting.


<br>Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.
<br>Case Study:

<br>Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind.

<br>The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. 




<br>With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession.

<br>The most widely used in the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale, a 23-item questionnaire covering various aspects of marital satisfaction, including communication, sex, affection, social activities, and values. 
<br>Assessments are designed to reveal strengths and weaknesses of a couple's relationship and the manner in which rewards and punishments are exchanged. Interviews and questionnaires are used to specify and elaborate target behaviors. 
<br>Jacobson's (1981) Pretreatment Assessment for Marital Therapy:

<br>Strengths and skills of the relationship:

<br>What are the major strengths of this relationship?
<br>What behaviors on the part of each spouse are highly valued by the other?
<br>What shared activities does the couple currently engage in?


<br>Presenting Problems:

<br>What are the major complaints, and how do these complaints translate into explicit behavioral terms?
<br>What are the reinforcers maintaining these behaviors?
<br>What behaviors occur at less than the desired frequency or fail to occur at appropriate times from the standpoint of each spouse?
<br>What are the consequences of these behaviors currently, when they occur?


<br>Sex and Affection:

<br>Is either spouse currently dissatisfied with rate, quality, or diversity of sex life together?
<br>If sex is currently a problem, was there a time when it was mutually satisfying?
<br>What are the sexual behaviors that seem to be associated with current dissatisfaction?
<br>Are either or both partners dissatisfied with the amount or quality of nonsexual physical affection?


<br>Future Prospects:

<br>Are the partners seeking therapy to improve their relationship, to separate, or to decide whether the relationship is worth working on?
<br>What are each spouse's reasons for continuing the relationship despite the current problems?


<br>Assessment of Social Environment:

<br>What are each person's alternatives to the present relationship?
<br>How attractive are these alternatives to each person?
<br>Is the environment (parents, relatives, friends, work associates, children) supportive of either continuance or dissolution of present relationship?


<br>Individual Functioning of Each Spouse:

<br>Does either spouse exhibit emotional or behavioral problems?
<br>Have they been in therapy before, either alone or together? What kind of therapy? Outcome?
<br>What is each spouse's past experience with intimate relationships?
<br>How is the present relationship difference?

<br>Richard Stuart (1975) lists five strategies that summarize the behavioral approach to troubled marriages:

<br>Couples are taught to express themselves in a clear, behavior descriptions rather than in vague complaints.
<br>Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. 
<br>Couples are helped to improve their communication. 
<br>Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. 
<br>Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. 


<br>Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. 

<br>Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. 


<br>Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. 

<br>Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. 
<br>Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. 


<br>Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations.

<br>The late Steve de Shazer was the founder of solution-focused therapy.

<br>A scholar as well as a clinician, de Shazer was intrigued by <a data-href="Gregory Bateson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/gregory-bateson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregory Bateson</a> theories of communication and Milton Erickson's pragmatic ideas about how to influence change.

De Shazer dies in Vienna on September 11th, 2005.


<br>Insoo Kim Berg was one of the primary architects of the solution-focused approach.

<br>Applied model to a variety of problems and service settings, including alcoholism, marital therapy, and family-based services to the poor. She died in 2007.

<br>Other well known solution-focused therapists include Eve Lipchik, Scott Miller, John Walter, and Jane Peller.

<br><br>
<br>Like the MRI group, solution-focused therapists believe that people are constrained by narrow views of their problems into perpetuating rigid patterns of false solutions. 

<br>O'Hanlon and Weiner-Davis (1989):

<br>So, the meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. If the methods used do not produce a satisfactory outcome, the original assumption about the meaning of the behavior is generally not questioned... Instead, people often redouble their efforts to solve the problem in an ineffective way, thinking that by doing it more, harder or better (e.g. more punishments, more heart-to-heart talks, and so on) they will finally solve it.




<br>The MRI model was inspired by Milton Erickson's view of people as containing cast reservoirs of untapped creativity. According to this view, people may need only a shift of perspective to release their potential. Part of that shift involves changing the way people talk about their problems.

<br>The language of problems tend to be different from the language of solutions. 

<br>The language of solutions is more hopeful and future oriented. Part of a therapist's job is to steer clients from problem talk to solution talk. In the solution-focused model, the future is negotiable.




<br><br>
<br>The more you emphasize family dynamics, the more you see people embedded in a network of connections that constrain their actions. Solution-focused therapists pay less attention to the forces controlling family members because they see people as relatively fluid and changeable - and they treat them that way in therapy.
<br><br>
<br>In the solution-focused model, clients are assumed to be the experts on their own lives. 

<br>"Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?"
<br>"If as a practitioner, you wish to put clients into the position of being experts on their own lives, you will have to know how to set aside your own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of your clients."


<br>Solution-focused therapists assume that people are resourceful. The problems they have are not seen as evidence of failure but rather as normal life-cycle complications.

<br>It can be seen as a commitment to the belief that families have the ability to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. 


<br>Implicit in this model is an asymptomatic perspective on family normality; that is, a normal family is simply one that has been freed of its presenting problems and thus returned to its own unique functional way of living. 

<br>"Solution-oriented therapists don't believe that there is any single 'correct' or 'valid' way to live one's life. We have come to understand that what is unacceptable behavior in one family or for one person is desirable behavior in another. Therefore, clients, not therapists, identify the goals to be accomplished in treatment.


<br><br>
<br>The very act of categorizing people suggests they are a certain way all the time. 

<br>Solution-focused therapists steer clients away from speculating about problem formation, they also avoid such conjecture themselves. Their conviction is that solutions are often unrelated to the way problems developed and that exploring etiology is engaging in problem talk - exactly what they seek to avoid. They believe that problem-focused thinking keeps people from discovering effective solutions. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking.


<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapy works by setting clear goals and building on exceptions to problems. 
<br>Good therapy is never a simple matter of implementing a few specific techniques. It is - or should be - a complicated enterprise involving all the elements that make helping relationships work. 
<br><br>
<br>The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting complaint as expeditiously as possible. The search for underlying flaws is rejected. 
<br>Solution-focused therapists don't believe it's necessary to delve into these deeper issues in order to help people resolve their problems. The goal is never about how families should be structure but only what they want different in their lives. 
<br>The process of goal setting itself is an important intervention in this approach. 

<br>It is important to assist client in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. Helping people to stop dwelling on their dissatisfactions and envision what they want to be doing instead is seen as the first step in helping them get there. 


<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapy works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems - effective solutions already in their repertoire. What's needed for change is a shift in the way a problem is 'languaged':

<br>"What we talk about and how we talk about it makes a difference, and it is these differences that can be used to make a difference to the client."


<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished because 'as the client and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in the truth of reality of what they are talking about. This is the way language works, naturally.'

<br>This is why solution-focused therapy can be so brief:

<br>It's a lot easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior. The assumption is that getting them to talk positively to solve their problems. 




<br><br><br>
<br>After getting a brief description of the presenting complaint, solution-focused practitioners move directly to asking clients how things will be different in their lives when their problems are solved. Then, instead of formulating some kind of intervention plan, the therapist asks about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. 
<br>The following questions suggest the proactive nature of a solution-focused assessment:

<br>"What do you think the problem is now?"
<br>"How will you know when the problem is solved?"
<br>"How will you know you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?"
<br>"What will have to be different for that to happen in terms of your behavior, thoughts, and feelings?"
<br>"What will you notice that is different about others involved in the situation?"
<br>"What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?"


<br>They say that anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions. They also need little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand. Solution-focused therapists ask more about perceptions than about feelings. And they affirm the clients' position. All clients want some indication that their therapist has understood the point of view that guides their actions. 

<br>The solution-focused therapist doesn't function as an expert in determining what's wrong (enmeshment, triangulation) and planning how to correct it. 

<br>Clients are the experts on what they want to change. 


<br>Although solution-focused therapists don't play the role of an authority figure who will help clients solve their problems, they do take an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. 

<br>The following sorts of questions are asked to lay the groundwork for therapeutic goal development:

<br>"What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?"
<br>"What needs to happen so that this will not have been a waste of your time?"
<br>"Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problem that brought you here today?"


<br>Based on the answers to these questions, the therapist and clients begin to construct a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once this description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the clients to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represents the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone or the clients are coping with it so well that it is no longer problematic. 

<br>The clients' rating makes it possible to assess how far they are from the goal. Later, the same scale can be used to determine what specific actions will allow the clients to move toward the goal and to evaluate progress. If the clients identify new problems, the therapist makes a new scale to depict desired outcomes and to assess progress toward new solutions. 






<br>Practitioners distinguish between visitors, complainants, and customers. 

<br><a data-href="Visitor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/visitor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Visitor</a>s:

<br>Someone who's not really in the market for therapy.
<br>Visitors are there at someone else's insistence, but they don't really have a complaint and don't want to be there. Therapists should not offer any suggestions to these clients or seek to convince them that they really need therapy. 
<br>It is important to pay attention to how they were referred and to consider who the real client is - the individual who wants something to change.
<br>If the people in your office are present only because someone pressured them to be there, a useful strategy is to ask them what they need to do to satisfy the authority that compelled them to seek therapy. 

<br>"So, what has to happen to get your mother off your back?"
<br>"What's the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?"




<br><a data-href="Complainant" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complainant.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complainant</a>s:

<br>They have clear complaints, but they're usually about someone else. 
<br>It may be useful to suggest noticing exceptions in the problem behavior of the other family member. The solution-focused therapist accepts the complainant's views, gives compliments, and may suggest observing exceptions to the complaint pattern. 
<br>With such clients, solution-focused therapists try to shift the conversation from problem talk to solution talk. 

<br>"How were you hoping I might be useful to you?"

<br>Then strategize with them about how they can act differently to influence those recalcitrant others. 






<br><a data-href="Customer" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/customer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Customer</a>s:

<br>They have clear complaints and are ready to take action. With a customer, you can move directly to establish goals and look for solutions. 

<br>These distinctions are not qualities of character but qualities of the therapeutic relationship and therefore fluid. With an apparently unmotivated complainant, a therapist's job is to engage in a solution-focused conversation, compliment the client, and possibly give an assignment to observe exceptions to the problem. 

<br>By not pushing for change but instead shifting attention away from problems and toward solutions, the relationship may evolve into one in which the client becomes a customer for change. 








<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused techniques are organized around two fundamental strategies:

<br>Developing well-focused goals within the clients' frame of reference. 
<br>Generating solutions based on exceptions.


<br>Therapy is usually brief (3-5 sessions), and appointments are made one at a time, on the assumption that one more may be enough. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem: "How were you hoping I could help you?" Solution-focused therapists take pains to work within the clients' frame of reference. They ask for the clients' perceptions and are careful to acknowledge them, using the clients' own language as much as possible. 
<br>It is a good idea to ask clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. People usually attempt various strategies to deal with their problems, and these efforts may have been more or less successful. Either way, these previous attempts at solution now play an important part in the clients' perception of what works and doesn't work for them.
<br><br>
<br>The next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. Solution-focused therapists help translate vague or amorphous goals into specific, behavioral terms by asking questions like:

<br>"Specifically how will you be doing this?"
<br>"How will the two of you know when you have solved your problems? How will things be different?"
<br>"What will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else?"


<br>The clearer the goal, the easier it is to measure progress. 

<br>"What will you be doing differently?"
<br>Part of the process of solution-focused therapy is helping clients think about constructive actions they can take rather than how they can get someone else to change. Useful goals are specific and include positive actions. They are also modest enough to be achievable. 


<br><a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a>:

<br>"Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened and the problem which brought you here is solved? "
<br>The miracle question invites clients to envision positive outcomes and begins to activate a problem-solving mind-set by giving them a mental picture of their goals. 
<br>The miracle question also helps clients look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do the things that the problem has been obstructing. If the therapist can encourage them to begin doing those things despite the problem, suddenly the problem may not loom as large. 


<br><br>
<br>Probing for exceptions - times when clients did not have the problem - invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. Such probing involves asking <a data-href="Exception Question" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/exception-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Exception Question</a>s like these:

<br>"When in the recent past might the problem have happened but did not (or was less intense or more manageable)?"
<br>"What's different about those times when the problem does not happen?"
<br>"How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you?"


<br>Finding the exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail. Also, and since these exceptions just happened, it's more plausible that they could happen again. By exploring these times and what was different about them, clients find clues to what they can do to expand these exceptions. 
<br>Exploring exceptions allows the therapist and client to build on past successes. Failing that, the therapist can ask why things are not worse - "How did you manage that?" - and then build on that accomplishment. 

<br><a data-href="Coping Questions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coping-questions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coping Questions</a>:

<br>Can help clients recognize that simply by enduring, they are more resourceful than they realize:

<br>"What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?"
<br>"How come things are not worse?"
<br>"What have you done to keep them from getting worse?"


<br>If the client provides answers, the therapist can build on them with questions about how that endurance can be maintained and how more of that effort can be brought to bear. 




<br>A solution-focused therapist spends most of the session listening for evidence of previous solutions, exceptions, and goals. When such evidence comes out, the therapist punctuates it with enthusiasm and support. The therapist then works to keep solution talk in the forefront. 
<br><br>
<br>Scaling questions were introduced to help therapists and clients talk about vague topics such a depression and communication, where it is difficult to identify concrete changes. 

<br>"The therapists asks the depressed client, for example, "On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now?"

<br>The therapist and client can recognize and nurture small changes toward the goal rather than being stuck. 




<br>Scaling questions are also used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. "On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that.. this week?"

<br>This device has a kind of 'prove-it' implication. The response is followed up by asking clients what they might do to increase the odds of success: "What do you have to do to stick to your guns this time?" 


<br>Asking scaling questions is a useful way of anticipating and disarming resistance and backsliding and of encouraging commitment to change. 
<br>This intervention has two major components:

<br>It is a solution-focused assessment device. If it is used each session, the therapist and clients have an ongoing measure of progress. 
<br>It is a powerful intervention by itself because it allows the therapist to focus on previous solutions and exceptions and to punctuate new changes as they occur. 

<br>Like the changes made before the first session, one of three things can happen between each session:

<br>Things can get better

<br>If things get better from one session to the next, the therapist compliments the clients and then gets details about how they were able to make such changes. This not only supports and solidifies the changes but also nudges clients to do more of the same. 


<br>Things can stay the same

<br>If things stay the same, the clients can be complimented on maintaining their changes or for not letting things get worse: "How did you keep it from going down?" The therapist can again compliment and support and encourage more of that change. 


<br>Things can get worse






<br><br>
<br>Compliments are conveyed with questions:

<br>"Wow! How did you do that?"

<br>Phrasing calls attention to the fact that the clients have already accomplished something. Doing so invites clients to describe their successes and thus helps foster self-confidence. 




<br>To be effective, <a data-href="Compliments" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/compliments.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Compliments</a> should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Most clients know what is wrong but have run out of ideas about how to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. 
<br>Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work. 
<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapy is often practiced in a team approach, with a therapist in the session and colleagues observing behind the mirror. Whether working with a team or alone, the therapist usually takes a 10-minute break near the end of the session. During this time, the therapist (with the team or alone) composes a summary message to the clients. 

<br>The session break can be used to promote a collaborative mind-set:

<br>"We're nearing the end of the session and I would like to take a 10-minute break. This is to give you time to think and reflect about what we have discussed; to pick out any important ideas came up, or to make decisions or plans. You might also like to think about whether this session has been useful and how you would like us to be further involved, if that would be helpful. While you are thinking, I will consult with my team for their thoughts. We will think together about what you said. When we get back together, I will be interested to hear what stood out for you today. I will also share the teams' thoughts with you. Together, then, we can put something together that will be helpful."




<br>The summary message begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the clients' goals, and pre-session progress and strengths: "What I have hear you tell me today..."

<br>This recap is followed by a statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy, a reflection of the emotional impact on the client, compliments on pre-session changes or strengths, and some comment on the client's goals. 

<br>The therapist then makes suggestions about building positives. Among the suggestions used commonly in solution-focused therapy are the following:

<br>The formula first-session task:

<br>"Between now and the next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens in your family that you ant to continue to have happen."


<br>Do more of what works.
<br>Do something different. 

<br>The suggestion to do something different can be given as an experiment. 


<br>Go slow.

<br>This suggestion, taken from the MRI model, is designed to help clients overcome fear of change by asking about possible negative consequences of changing and warning against trying to change too rapidly. 


<br>Do the opposite. 

<br>This suggestion is based on the notion that many problems are maintained by attempted solutions. Suggesting that clients try the opposite of what they have been doing is especially useful for problems that exist between just two people. 


<br>The prediction task.

<br>"Before you go to bed tonight, predict whether the problem will be better or the same tomorrow. Tomorrow night rate the day, and compare it with your prediction. Think about what may have accounted for the right or wrong prediction. Repeat this every night until we meet again."








<br>The solution-focused approach is drawing attention to the family's resources and encouraging them to capitalize on their strengths in order to focus on solutions rather than problems. 
<br><br>
<br>Later sessions are devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress. When a family returns for a subsequent session, the solution-focused therapist endeavors to create a cooperative mind-set and then inquires about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the client's role in attaining it. 
<br>Then the therapist assists the clients in looking forward to how they will plan their next steps toward solution:

<br>"What's better?" or "What happened that you liked?"
<br>"Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that."
<br>"Wow! That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?"
<br>"And what else is better? What do you think the next step might be? On a scale of 1 to 10, you say your progress is now at a 5. What would a 6 look like?"
<br>If there was no discernable progress, coping questions may be asked:

<br>"How did you keep things from getting worse?"
<br>"What's your idea about what might be helpful?"
<br>"What do you think the next step should be?"




<br><br>
<br>Suggestions:

<br>Notice some positive about the child: their colorful sneakers, team cap, etc. 
<br>Use relationship questions such as 'What would your mother tell me is your best subject in school?'
<br>Avoid 'why' questions. Try asking 'how come?'; It is less intimidating. 
<br>Responding to 'I do not know"; Acknowledge that it was a hard question, then say, "Suppose you did know; what would you say?" or "What would your best friend say?"


<br><br>
<br>Its promise of quick solutions has endeared it to the managed care industry, and providers have been eager to identify thgemselves as solution-focused. 
<br>Its applications includ:

<br>Couples therapy
<br>Family therapy
<br>Behavioral problems in children
<br>Families with suicidal members
<br>Domestic violence
<br>Sexual abuse
<br>Alcoholism
<br>Families with children with severe intellectual disabilities, and schizophrenia. 


<br>Some have proposed models that incorporate solution-focused techniques (e.g., <a data-href="Scaling Questions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/scaling-questions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Scaling Questions</a>, <a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a>) into other forms of family therapy, most commonly structural family therapy, in the treatment of adolescent substance use, adoption, and low-conflict divorce. 
<br>The solution-focused model has also been applied outside of traditional therapeutic practice to include interventions in family medicine clinics, social service agencies, nursing care, educational settings and model schools, and business systems.
<br>The two most powerful ingredients in solution-focused therapy are:

<br>Building on what works
<br>Helping people identify what they want rather than what they don't want


<br>People who come for help often think of the times when their problems don't occur as unimportant because these occasions seem accidental or inconsistent. Calling attention to past successes and latent abilities helps clients rediscover their own best coping strategies. 
<br>The great thing about the imagination is that with very limited encouragement, people can see themselves as succeeding rather than fumbling and failing. 

<br>In the solution-focused therapist, clients have a coach and guide to help them work toward this brighter future. 


<br>Like any approach in the early stages of evolution, solution-focused therapy was sometimes presented in a cookbook style, leading some to imagine that treatment can be reduced to a set of formulaic techniques. 

<br>The unique features of solution-focused therapy are deceptively easy to describe, but like all therapies, it takes great skill to implement effectively. 


<br>A second major criticism of solution-focused therapy is that its insistence on solution talk may cut off clients from empathy and understanding. 
<br>The issue of whether solution-focused therapy is genuinely collaborative has been raised frequently. 

<br>This approach has even been called 'solution-forced therapy' by some because of the perceived tendency for therapists to pressure clients into discussing only positives. 


<br>Solution-focused therapists have stressed the importance of the therapeutic relationship. 

<br>"The speed and success of solution construction depend on the therapist's ability to stay connected with the clients' reality throughout the course of therapy. This is the underpinning for the whole collaborative process, the grease that keeps the axles turning."
<br>The solution-focused approach won't likely be effective if therapists, in a rush to get to their own agenda, fail to listen to clients and make them feel understood. 


<br>It is unfortunate that more research has not been done to test the effectiveness of solution-focused therapy. Most of the research has been conducted by solution-focused practitioners themselves. 

<br>It has been concluded that while methodological weaknesses existed in most cases using solution-focused therapy, the studies do provide tentative support for the use of solution-focused brief therapy in the treatment of a child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. 

<br>It was also concluded that solution-focused therapy may hold more promise as a mode of early intervention when the presenting problem is not as severe. 




<br><br>
<br>One aims to help clients do less of what doesn’t work; the other promotes more of what does. Both of these pragmatic approaches focus on the presenting complaint and aim to resolve it as quickly as possible. The MRI model does so by looking for failed solutions to eliminate; the solution-focused approach searches for forgotten solutions to rediscover.

<br>whereas the MRI approach focuses on behavior, the solution-focused model emphasizes cognition as well as behavior. MRI therapists urge clients to do things differently; solution-focused therapists urge them to view things differently.


<br>Problems are seen as persisting in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. The idea is that people often get stuck in their problems because by trying to get to the bottom of them, they overlook solutions that are right under their noses.
<br>the development of a set of techniques for changing problem talk into solution talk.

<br>These techniques include:
<br>Exception questions (“Can you think of a time when you didn’t have the problem? What were you doing then?”)
<br>The miracle question (“Suppose you went to sleep and a miracle happened such that when you awoke, your problem was solved. What would be different?”)
<br>Scaling questions (“On a scale from 1 to 10, how do you feel now compared to when you called?”)
<br>Coping questions (“Given how bad that was, how were you able to cope?”)
<br>The formula first-session task (“After you leave today, observe what happens that you want to continue during the next week.”)
<br>Compliments (“Wow, you must be very smart to have thought of that!”). 
<br>These techniques are put into practice as soon as possible to keep the work brief and to discourage clients from dwelling on the negative side of their experience.


<br>This has led to a call for greater collaboration with clients so that their feelings are acknowledged and validated before solution-focused techniques are introduced.
<br>Some of its popularity can be attributed to therapists’ struggle to find ways to feel effective while living with managed care’s limited number of sessions. In addition, the techniques of this therapy are relatively easy to learn (the basics can be picked up in a few workshops), and its upbeat nature makes it more enjoyable for many therapists.

<br>Yet its easy-to-learn formula leads some therapists to dismiss it as superficial. Critics question whether therapists are really having a respectful conversation with clients when they only coax optimism.

<br>


<br><br>
<br>The narrative approach is a perfect expression of the postmodern revolution. 

<br>It's approach is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave.

<br>Personal experience is fundamentally ambiguous.

<br>Understanding human experience, including our own, is never simply a matter of observing it. The elements of experience are understood only through a process that organizes those elements, puts them together, assigns meaning, and prioritizes them. 


<br>Strategic therapists give clients reframes, or new interpretations, for their experience. Narrative therapists believe that such interpretations won't take unless they fit people's stories. 


<br>Unlike the cybernetic metaphor, which focused on self-defeating patterns of behavior, the narrative metaphor focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. With the cybernetic metaphor, therapy meant blocking maladaptive interactions. The narrative metaphor, on the other hand, focuses on expanding clients' thinking to allow them to consider alternative ways of looking at themselves and their problems.

- The art of analyzing literary texts or human experience, understood as fundamentally ambiguous, by interpreting levels of meaning.<br>
- The truth of experience is not discovered; it's created. The goal of therapy shifted from historical truth to narrative intelligibility. The challenge was to construct truths in the service of self-coherence, not to resurrect a true picture of the past.<br>
- Stories don't just mirror life; they shape it. 

<br>Narrative therapists believe that problems arise when people are indoctrinated into narrow and self-defeating views of themselves. 

<br>To counter the way society convinces people they are their problems, narrative therapists externalize problem. Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are encouraged to think of themselves as struggling against their problem; the problem is the problem.

<br>


<br>Narrative therapists have little to say about family dynamics because they reject the idea that families are responsible for the problems of family members. 


<br>


<br>Narrative therapists not only avoid judgements about what is normal but also reject the very idea of categorizing people. 
<br>Too often in human history, the judgements made by people in power regarding normality and abnormality have been used to subjugate those with no voice in the matter. 

<br>Family therapists may have trouble seeing their own concepts - such as rigid boundaries, cross-generational coalitions, and enmeshment. 

<br>Narrative therapists strive to help clients make sense of their own experience. 




<br>Narrative therapists endeavor to situate themselves with clients; that is, to disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are also encourages to educate therapists regarding their cultural predicaments and to correct them when they make assumptions that don't fit the clients' experience. 
<br>The basic assumptions narrative therapists make about normal families:

<br>People...

<br>Have good intentions (they don't need or want problems)
<br>Are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them.
<br>Are not their problems. 
<br>Can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the culture myths they have internalized. 






<br>


<br>Narrative therapists concentrate on the way individuals narrate their exchange. It's their stories that affect not only what they notice but also how they interpret it. 
<br>Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. 

<br>Such closed and rigid narratives make people vulnerable to being overtaken by destructive emotional states that narrative therapists portray as alien invaders. 

<br>They do believe that such emotional responses are external in the sense that they are socially constructed. Externalizing problems cuts down on guilt and blame. 






<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapists do not strive for clinical neutrality. They are active advocates who take sides with their clients and encourage them to see themselves as courageous warriors against the forces that try to trap them in pessimistic mind-sets.
<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapists help people separate themselves from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions) to open space for new and more constructive views of themselves. Narrative therapy transforms identities from flawed to preferred, not by getting family members to confront their conflicts but by separating individuals from problems and then uniting the family to fight a common enemy. This is facilitated by combing the family's history for unique outcomes, or times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. 
<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapists help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones.

<br>Reweaving narrative accounts into more palatable and coherent histories. 
<br>Involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience.

<br>Narrative therapists use externalizing conversations to help separate persons from problems. This is one way to deconstruct disempowering assumptions. 

<br>Once a problem has been externalized and redefined in more experience-near terms, an individual can begin to resist it. By viewing the problem as an external entity, narrative therapists free families to challenge its influence on their lives.  

<br>They also endeavor to shift family members' perceptions of one another from totalizing views, which reduce them to one set of frustrating responses.

<br>In externalizing conversations, therapists ask effects questions such as, "How does the problem affect you? Your attitudes?" Through this process, the problem's field of influence is broadened so that clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. It is in these areas that clients can notice unique outcomes - experiences that would not be predicted by a telling of the problem story, times when they resisted the problem's influence.
<br>As long as both sides remain fixed in polarized perspectives, they may be too busy to think about their own preferences. In unhappy families, people are often so busy not being what others expect that they have no time to figure out what they want for themselves.

 <br><br><br>
<br>People constantly construct knowledge, and we function in a perpetual state of assessing the information that is presented to us. Interpreting the perceptions of what we see and what we hear allows us to reach conclusion about the world around us. 
<br><br>
<br>The investigator's interpretation of information and evidence commonly requires answers to many questions that can lead critical of decisions, action, and outcomes, such as:

<br>What must be done to protect the life and safety of persons?
<br>Should force, up to and including deadly force, be used to resolve a situation?
<br>Who will become the focus or subject of a criminal investigation?
<br>What is the best plan to apprehend the person or persons responsible for a criminal act?
<br>Will someone be subjected to a search of their person or of their home?
<br>Will someone be subjected to detention or arrest and questioning for a criminal act?
<br>Will someone have a criminal charge sworn against them?
<br>Will someone be subjected to a criminal trial?
<br>Will someone's liberty as a free person be at-risk?
<br>Will justice be served?
<br>Will the community be protected?


<br>The investigator must always be ready to explain their thinking and actions to the court. 

<br>Thinking must illustrate an evidence-based path to forming reasonable ground for beliefs and subsequent action. 
<br>Thinking must demonstrate consideration of the statutory law and case law relevant to the matter being investigated. 


<br>Investigation is the collection and analysis of evidence.
