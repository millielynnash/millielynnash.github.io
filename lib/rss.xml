<br><br>Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents’ development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n = 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difﬁculties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These ﬁndings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.<br><br>

<br>Theory:

<br>Describe the following elements of the Satir model and emotionally focused therapy:

<br>Process of therapy
<br>Therapeutic relationship
<br>Case conceptualization
<br>Goal setting
<br>Interventions




<br>Case Conceptualization and Treatment Plan

<br>Complete a theory-specific case conceptualizations and treatment plans for Satir family therapy and emotionally focused couples therapy using templates that are provided. 


<br>Research

<br>Provide an overview of significant research findings for Satir family therapy and emotionally focused couples therapy. 


<br>Diversity

<br>Analyze strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications for using experiential approaches with clients in relation to their social location/diverse identities, including but not limited to ethnic, racial, and/or sexual/gender identity diversity. 


<br>Cross-Theoretical Comparison

<br>Compare how experiential therapies utilize interpersonal patterns (IPs) with other approaches described in this book. 


<br><br>
<br>Integrating systemic theory with humanism, experiential family therapists are noted for their warmth and direct emotional engagement with clients. These approaches include:

<br>The Satir Model

<br>EFT integrates experiential, systemic, and attachment theories to help couples and families create emotional safety to foster wellness interaction patterns.

<br><br><br>
<br>Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. 
<br>Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. 
<br>Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. 
<br>This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. 
<br>In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated.

<br>The <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a> in the Satir model offer a clinician an efficient and effect means of conceptualizing how best to communicate and interact with the client. 
<br>She describes 4 communication survival or coping stances:

<br>These stances develop in childhoodand reveal how a person communicates under stress, especially when they do not feel emotionally safe in intimate relationships. 
<br>A person can use more than one, but typically a person uses one style predominantly. 
<br>Each stance acknowledges or minimizes three basic realities:

<br>Self
<br>Other
<br>Context


<br>The goal is to move people toward <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication in which they respectfully balance the needs of self and others while responding appropriately within and acknowledging the context . 
<br><img alt="Congruent Communication Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/congruent-communication-diagram.png">
<br><br>
<br>Each survival stance minimizes one or more essential part of the total picture. 
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Placator Stance Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/placator-stance-diagram.png">
<br>Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. 
<br>Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. 

<br>Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. 


<br>Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. 
<br>Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established. 
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Blamer Stance Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/blamer-stance-diagram.png">
<br>Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
<br>With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society. 
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Superreasonable Stance Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/superreasonable-stance-diagram.png">
<br>When working with those who use a super-reasonable stance, logic and rules reign supreme. 
<br>Since these clients avoid all emotions, therapists might best engage them by starting with their bodily reactions and expectations before moving onto feelings. 
<br>The goal with this stance is to help clients value the internal, subjective realities of themselves and others.
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Irrelevant Stance Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/irrelevant-stance-diagram.png">
<br>A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. 
<br>The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. 
<br>Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. 
<br>As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. 
<br>Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently.

<br><a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a>

<br>She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 
<br>1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program.


<br><br>
<br>Satir uses a six-stage model of change that is based on research on <a data-href="Cybernetics" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/cybernetics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cybernetics</a> systems conducted by Satir while at the MRI. 

<br>Her six-stage model describes how the therapy process helps families move toward a <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> in the family structure. 


<br>The model emphasizes that the therapist perturbs the system (Shaking it up and respecting its ability to naturally reorganize itself in a more useful way) rather than attempting to direct and control the system from the outside. 
<br>Even though Satir uses education and coaches clients on how to better communicate, the aim is not for clients to follow her instructions literally but rather to adapt and respond to the instructions in a way that works for their system. 
<br>The six-stages:

<br><a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>

<br>This is a state of homeostasis that includes at least one symptomatic member. 


<br><a data-href="Foreign Element" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/foreign-element.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Foreign Element</a>

<br>May be a life crisis, tragedy, or therapeutic intervention, gets the system off balance. 


<br><a data-href="Chaos" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/chaos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chaos</a>

<br>The new perspective creates a <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop that throws the system into a state of chaos. At this point, the 'natural' response is to feel uncomfortable, and in almost all cases the family tries to regain the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>, which may or may not be possible. 


<br><a data-href="Integration of New Possibilities" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/integration-of-new-possibilities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Integration of New Possibilities</a>

<br>Eventually, the family system interprets the new information in a meaningful way; the therapist needs to be respectful of how the system uses the information and responds to therapist-client interactions, honoring and trusting the system's autonomy. 


<br>Practice

<br>The system develops a new set of interaction patterns based on the new information. 
<br>This may or may not look like what the therapist expects, but the therapist asks two key evaluative questions:

<br>Are the symptoms improving?
<br>Is each person able to self-actualize and grow?




<br>New Status Quo

<br>This is a state of new homeostasis that does not include a symptomatic member and that allows all members to grow and flourish. 




<br>Therapy involves going through these 6 stages several times, with the discomfort and relative sense of chaos diminishing each time the client cycles through, becoming increasingly comfortable with change. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Four primary assumptions about people and therapy:

<br>People naturally tend toward positive growth (humanistic principle).
<br>All people possess the resources for positive growth (humanistic principle).
<br>Every person and every thing or situation impacts and is impacted by everyone and everything else (systemic principle)
<br>Therapy is a process that involves interaction between a therapist and a client. In this relationship, each person is responsible for themselves (systemic and humanistic principle).


<br>These assumptions clarify the therapist's role in the process (the therapist is 'responsible for themself'), but also how the therapist believes the therapeutic process works:

<br>Clients already possess the natural inclination toward growth and the resources for it, and it is the therapist's job to activate these tendencies. 


<br>The role of the therapist is that of a guide to the process of becoming more fully human. 
<br><br>
<br>Carl Rogers, a leader in humanistic, experiential therapies, based his client-centered approach on three therapist qualities:

<br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> or Genuineness
<br>Accurate <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>
<br>Unconditional Positive Regard


<br>These conditions are the theoretical foundations of warmth and humanity. 

<br>This quality of being, or therapeutic presnce, is difficult to define, and there are methods for systematically developing it. 
<br>The more therapists are <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> - that is being able to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others - the better they can create the therapeutic warmth and humanity. 


<br><br>
<br>Satir describes establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact,' which refers to a series of connection both within the therapist and between the therapist and client. 
<br>Making contact begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self as defined in the <a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>: physical, intellectual, emotional, sensual, interactional, nutritional, contextual, and spiritual. 
<br>The therapist also prepares to meet another 'miracle,' a fellow human being. 
<br>The therapist then works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels':

<br>Mind
<br>Body
<br>Spirit
<br>Open body position and congruent communication are critical. 


<br>Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other and ultimately with others in their broader social system. 
<br>The therapy process cannot move forward until the therapist has made contact with the client. 

<br>When contact is made, clients feel valued for who they are, regardless of their problem, and they feel free to make mistakes in the therapist's presence. 


<br>Making contact involves:

<br>Making direct eye contact
<br>Touching clients (e.g., shaking hands)
<br>Sitting or standing at the same physical level so that eye contact is easy (i.e., leaning down to talk with children)
<br>Asking each person's name and how he or she prefers to be called


<br><br>
<br>Satir practitioners convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a>, an accurate understanding of another's emotional reality. 
<br>Clients like therapists who take their side, don't confront them, and ignore their responsibility in the problem situation. This type of validation is detrimental to therapeutic progress.
<br>Comments that imply a client has a right to feel a certain way can also shut down the process of reflecting on the client's responsibility for their half of an interaction. 
<br>Expressing empathy emphasizes that is not wrong or right, not normal or abnormal, to feel a certain way - it is simply how the client feels and means that this is their 'truth,' at least for the moment (e.g., "It sounds as though you felt betrayed")

<br>Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it as right or normal makes it much easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience that is also 'true' for that person, creating a context from which to understand how these two (or more) realities may collide and create problematic interactions. 


<br><br>
<br>In joining with clients, therapists instill hope that they can change and that the situation can be better, even if it seems hopeless at the moment. 
<br>Satir et al., (1991) emphasize that clients must have faith that change is possible before they can move forward with treatment. 
<br><br>
<br>Clients need to believe that therapy and their therapist can help them resolve their problems. 
<br>Therapists establish credibility by making a personal connection (making contact) and by being confident and competent (modeling high self-esteem). 
<br><br>
<br>Both family functioning and individual functioning are assessed.

<br><br>
<br>Satir viewed the symptom as having a role in the family system. 
<br>Symptoms always have an emotional function in the family system, even if they are consciously and logically unwanted. 
<br>Why is this particular symptom manifesting in this particular family (or relationship)?

<br>If the therapist can understand how the symptom makes emotional sense in the family dance, it will be easier to help the family find ways to interact successfully without the need for the symptom. 


<br><br>
<br>Along with assessing family roles, identify problematic family dynamics:

<br>Power Struggles

<br>These can be within the family and couple or with extended family members. 


<br>Parental Conflicts

<br>These can involve parents disagreeing about how to parent and care for children. 


<br>Lack of Validation

<br>The family openly expresses little emotional support or validation. 


<br>Lack of Intimacy

<br>There is minimal sharing of significant personal information and one's emotional life. 




<br><br>
<br>Satir assessed each person's role in the family system to understand the function of the problem. 
<br>Possible roles include:

<br><br>
<br>The family life chronology is a timeline that includes the major events in an individual's or family's life. 

<br>Births and deaths
<br>Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
<br>Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns)


<br>This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist. 
<br><br>
<br>Another area for assessment is the survival triad - the child, mother, and father - and the quality of the relationship between all three. 
<br>Satir asserted that it was in this primary triad that a child learns how to be human. 
<br>Is there an emotional bond between each parent and the child, or do the parents have significantly different levels of connection with the child?

<br>Because the survival triad should serve as a nurturing system for the child, when the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. 


<br><br>
<br>One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. 
<br>These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
<br>At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. 
<br>The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. 
<br>Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. 
<br>The six layers of the iceberg:

<br>Behavior

<br>The behavior on the surface; the external manifestations of the person's inner world.

<br>These come out in times of stress, and a person may use different stances in different relational contexts. 


<br>Feelings

<br>Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. 
<br>Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. 


<br>Perceptions

<br>Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality).


<br>Expectation

<br>A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). 


<br>Yearnings

<br>Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. 
<br>This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. 




<br>Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. 

<br>By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance. 


<br><br>
<br>It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. 
<br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. 

<br>People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.'


<br>The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. 

<br>Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. 


<br>As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions.

<br>Hyper and distracted




<br><br>
<br>The goal of Satir's model is transformation:

<br>To achieve optimal realization of a person's full potential. 
<br>This goal translates into two broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning:

<br>Relational, family, or systemic goals
<br>Individual goals




<br><br>
<br>The heart of relational goals in Satir's approach is congruent communication:

<br>The ability to communicate authentically while responding to the needs of both self and others. 


<br>The goal is to help the family develop ways for all members to communicate so that the system's homeostasis no longer needs the initial symptoms (problems) to maintain balance. 
<br><br>
<br>Increase congruent communication in relationships with spouse, parent, child, etc. 
<br>Change family rules and shoulds to general guidelines. 
<br><br>
<br>The overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches:

<br>To promote the self-actualization of all members of the system. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Therapists' use of self - being authentically who they are - is one of the most essential interventions. 
<br>By being authentic, therapists provide a role model for how to communicate congruently and also show the effects of increased self-actualization. 
<br>The use of the therapist's self in therapy, which may include self-disclosure, creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently without negative consequences and learn to tap into more authentic modes of expression. 
<br><br>
<br>The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. 
<br>The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. 
<br>When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.'

<br>What do I HEAR and SEE?

<br>The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. 
<br>This is similar to ' <a data-href="videotalk" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/videotalk" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href="Solution-Focused Therapy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. 


<br>What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see?

<br>After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. 
<br>Meanings often connect back to past experiences. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make?

<br>The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. 
<br>Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS?

<br>The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. 
<br>The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. 
<br>If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: "I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural."; incongruent: "I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.")
<br>Subsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. 


<br>What DEFENSES do I use?

<br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>. 


<br>What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use?

<br>Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'
<br>Most of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. 
<br>These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques'


<br>What is my RESPONSE in the situation?

<br>How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?
<br>Incongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change. 




<br><br>
<br>Satir therapists work with clients to help them express difficult-to-articulate emotions related to the presenting problem. 
<br>If the clients complain about family members or a difficult life situation, experiential therapists listen closely for the emotions, expressed or unexpressed, that are related to the problem circumstance. 

<br>They listen not just for the surface emotions, but also for deeper levels of emotion and use questions and empathetic reflections to focus clients on those deeper emotions. 


<br><br>
<br>If a client tells a story without identifying their emotions directly:

<br>"As I listen to you explain what happened to you during that argument, I am getting a sense that you were feeling [name the emotion]. Does that sound right?"
<br>"That sounds like a very difficult situation. Can you share some of the emotions you have been expeirencing as you go through this?"


<br>If a client does identify emotions, the therapy can help explore them with questions such as:

<br>"You say you were feeling [emotion]. I am wondering if part of you is also feeling [name another emotion that client seems to be experiencing]."
<br>"Can you say more about what feeling [name emotion] feels like for you."


<br><br>
<br>Satir coached families in softening rigid family rules by changing them to guidelines.

<br>For example, rather than saying "I should not get angry," a client or family was encouraged to revise the limiting rule to "What I am angry, I will express my anger in a way that is respectful to others and myself."


<br>Satir encouraged families to have as few rules as possible and to be flexible, adapting them for each context and as children's developmental needs change. 
<br><br>
<br>Coaching clients in how to have authentic, congruent communication in session, involves the ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' combined with specific communication coaching strategies. 
<br>When coaching communication, Satir had clients turn their chairs toward one another and gave the clients prompts, such as, "Tell your partner how you feel about what happened on Saturday night."

<br>If the client was able to congruently address their partner about this, Satir then prompted the partner to respond in kind, continuing this process until the problem was resolved. 


<br>When a person had trouble communicating congruently and reverted to a survival stance, Satir interrupted the conversation and suggested how to rephrase the statement or how to make the client's nonverbal communication more congruent (e.g., "Now, can you say that starting the statement with 'I' instead of 'you'?" or "Can you show me the emotion you say you are feeling when you speak to your wife?")
<br>The ' <a data-href="Ingredients of an Interaction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/ingredients-of-an-interaction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingredients of an Interaction</a> ' technique was used to help coach clients through what they heard and saw, how they interpreted and felt about it, and the feelings about feelings and family-of-origin rules for communicating about what happened. 
<br><br>
<br>Family <a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>, which is done either with the family or in a group setting. 
<br>Sculpting involves putting family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family. 
<br>Either the therapist or the client may direct the sculpting. 

<br>If family members are directing the sculpting, each person in the family is given the opportunity to sculpt the family as they see it. 
<br>Sometimes the sculptor assigns each family member to say a line that represents how they may be feeling, thinking, or viewing the situation. 
<br>Usually, however, the essence of this intervention is to give a nonverbal, symbolic depiction of the family process from each person's perspective. 


<br>Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses. 

<br>Through the sculpting process, a person is able to literally see how they are contributing to the problematic family process far more quickly than when the same information is provided with words. 


<br>When all family members are sculpting, it is generally best to let all family members sculpt how they see the family before allowing discussion of one another's sculpting. 
<br>Therapists encourage family members to respect each person's subjective experience as illustrated in the sculpting and to use the experience to deepen their understanding of one another. 
<br><br>
<br>Satir used touch in therapy to initially connect with clients and to encourage and reassure them when they were practicing new ways of communicating. 

<br>In this way, she underscored emotional context and provided palpable support. 


<br>She also used touch with children to help teach alternatives to violent behavior and to model for parents how to manage difficult children. 
<br>In today's practicing environments, touching is generally discouraged because it can easily be misinterpreted as sexual harassment or may make a client feel uncomfortable. 

<br>Therapists need to carefully consider the legal and ethical issues of using touch. 
<br>Touch may be appropriate in certain practice and cultural contexts. 
<br>At minimum, therapists can learn from Satir the importance of coaching clients in touching each other - their children and spouses - in more loving and helpful ways. 

<br>For example, rather than using a demonstration, therapists can guide a parent on how to hold children who are having a tantrum.

<br>A form of psychodrama, the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> is used to allow clients to explore unresolved family issues and life events in the safety of the group setting. 
<br>The client, who is called the ' <a data-href="Star" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/star.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Star</a> ,' first identifies key events in their life chronology and significant sources of influence.

The therapist facilitates the reenactment with the following three goals in mind:

<br>Identifying the roots of old learning and their role in the present.
<br>Developing a more realistic picture of the client's parents. 
<br>Discovering unique strengths and potentials.

<br>The person may have members enact generic characteristics (<a data-href="Martyr" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Martyr" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Martyr</a>, <a data-href="Victim or Helpless One" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Victim or Helpless One" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Victim or Helpless One</a>, savior) or use famous figures to represent different aspects of the self. 

<br>In this way, the therapist facilitates a process in which the client is better able to accept different aspects of the self and to identify the contexts in which these aspects have been and continue to be useful. The language of 'parts' can also be used to facilitate similar discussions and insights in individual, couples, and family therapy.

<br>Satir's approach tracks pathologizing interpersonal patterns (PIPs) with a specific focus on the emotional level of the interaction and adds to it an understanding of the intrapsychic experiences within each person. 
<br>The <a data-href="Iceberg Model" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/iceberg-model.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Iceberg Model</a> (<a data-href="Six Levels of Experience" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/six-levels-of-experience.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Six Levels of Experience</a>) helps therapists assess the internal PIPs that are part of the external PIP with others. 
<br>Survival stances often can be at the heart of PIP (<a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>)
<br><br>
<br>In the Satir's model, wellness interpersonal patterns (WIPs) are conceptualized in terms of congruent communication (relationally) and self-worth (intrapersonally). These can take the form of listening compassionately/sharing vulnerability or acknowledging self/appreciating self. 
<br><br>
<br>When facilitating change, the therapist uses several forms of transformational interaction patters (TIPs). 

<br>Family <a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a> takes the form of having everyone first sculpt the PIP and then having each person sculpt their desired WIPs. 
<br>When working more intrapsychically, the <a data-href="Iceberg Model" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/iceberg-model.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Iceberg Model</a> is used to identify both PIPs and WIPs as well, first identifying the negative inner monologue dialogue patterns (disapproving of self/disapproving of others) and then identifying alternatives (approving of self/approving of others). 
<br>Much of the family-of-origin work that characterize this approach involve healing interpersonal patterns (HIPs), especially the <a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a> and <a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>; this typically done by having another group member say what she always wished her parents would have said.

<br>The Undeclared War:

<br>We came to think of asylums as places of cruelty and detention, they were originally built to rescue the insane from being locked away in family attics.
<br>Therapists began to notice that often when a patient got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member.
<br>Patients often improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home.
<br>Parents use their children as a buffer to protect them from intimacy.


<br>Small Group Dynamics:

<br>Group dynamics were applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group.
<br>The Group Mind (1920) (McDougall)

<br>A group’s continuity depends on boundaries for differentiation of function and on customs and habits to make relationships predictable.


<br>Field theory by <a data-href="Kurt Lewin" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/kurt-lewin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kurt Lewin</a>. He developed the notion that a group is more than the sum of its parts. 
<br>Quasi-stationary social equilibrium: changing group behavior requires ‘unfreezing.’ Only after something shakes up group’s beliefs will its members be prepared to change. In individual therapy this process is initiated by the unhappy experiences that lead people to seek help.
<br>More effort is required to unfreeze, or shake up, families before real change can take place. The need for unfreezing foreshadowed early family therapists’ concern about disrupting family homeostasis.

<br>Fight-flight, dependency, and pairing:

<br>Some families skirt around hot issues like a cat circling a snake. Others use therapy to bicker endlessly, never really contemplating compromise, much less change.
<br>Dependency masquerades as therapy when families allow therapists to subvert their autonomy in the name of problem solving.
<br>Pairing is seen in families when one parent colludes with the children to undermine the other parent.


<br>Process/Content:

<br>Experienced therapists learn to attend as much to how people talk as to the content of their discussions.

<br>Describes family roles such as 'placator' or 'disagreeable one'


<br>Roles tend to be stereotyped in most groups, and so there are characteristic behavior patterns of group members.
<br>Roles tend to be complementary. Eventually parents of misbehaving children may become polarized into complementary roles of strictness and leniency. What makes such reciprocity resistant to change is that the roles reinforce each other.
<br>Group and family therapy are similar: Both are complex and dynamic, more like everyday life than individual therapy. In groups and families, patients must react to a number of people, not just a therapist, and therapeutic use of this interaction is the definitive mechanism of change in both contexts.
<br>It turns out that the differences between families and groups are so significant that the group therapy model has only limited applicability to family treatment. 
<br>Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy very different from group therapy.
<br>This feeling of safety among sympathetic strangers cannot be part of family therapy because instead of separating treatment from a stressful environment, the stressful environment is brought into the consulting room.

<br>Marriage Counseling:

<br>Two or more individuals in an important relationship.
<br>Repeated experience.
<br>A primary negative injunction, such as "Don't do X, or I will punish you."
<br>A second injunction at a more abstract level conflicting with the first, also enforced by punishment or perceived threat.
<br>A tertiary negative injunction prohibiting escape and demanding a response. Without this restriction the victim won't feel bound. 
<br>Finally, the complete set of ingredients is no longer necessary once the victim is conditioned to perceive the world in terms of double binds; any part of the sequence becomes sufficient to trigger panic or rage.


<br>Most examples of double binds in literature are inadequate because they do not include all the critical features. 

<br>An example of a double bind would be a teacher who urges his students to participate in class but gets impatient if one of them actually interrupts with a question or comment. 


<br>A schizophrenic has to deal with them continually - and the effect is maddening. Unable to comment on the dilemma, the schizophrenic responds defensively, perhaps by being concrete and literal, perhaps by speaking in metaphors. Eventually, the schizophrenic may come to assume that behind every statement lies a concealed meaning. 


<br>The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families cause schizophrenia. Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for the tragedy of their children's psychoses.

<br>Mystification distorts feelings and, more ominously, reality. When parents mystify a child's experience, the child's existence becomes inauthentic. Because their feelings aren't accepted, these children project a false self. In mild instances, this produces a lack of authenticity, but when the real self/false self split is carried to extremes, the result is madness.

<br>Although he began to see families in 1950s, he didn't publish his ideas until a decade later. He didn't establish a clinic, develop a training program, or train well-known students.

<br>Child-Centered Phase:

<br>Children encouraged to express wishes and concerns.


<br>Parent-Centered Stage:

<br>Parents complained about their children's behavior. Bell careful to soften the harshest parental criticisms in order to focus on problem-solving.


<br>Family-Centered Stage:

<br>Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia

<br>Emphasized theory
<br>Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).
<br>Beginning in 1955, when Bowen started bringing family members together to discuss their problems, he was struck by their <a data-href="Emotional Reactivity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-reactivity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Reactivity</a>. Feelings overwhelmed reason. Bowen felt families’ tendency to pull him into the center of this <a data-href="Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass</a>, and he had to make a concerted effort to remain objective (Bowen, 1961). The ability to remain neutral and focus on the process, rather than content, of family discussions is what distinguishes a therapist from a participant in a family’s drama.
<br>To control the level of emotion, Bowen encouraged family members to talk to him, not to each other
<br>therapists weren’t immune to being sucked into family conflicts
<br>Whenever two people are struggling with conflict they can’t resolve, there is an automatic tendency to involve a third party

<br>Triangle is the smallest stable unit of relationship
<br>Process of complaining to third party means less likely to address the problem at its source
<br>Triangling process is destructive when it becomes regular feature of a relationship

<br>Repeating what someone says to you about someone else is one way to stop triangling in its tracks


<br>Triangles spread out


<br>Bowen Family Life:

<br>In 1966 an emotional crisis in Bowen’s family led to a personal voyage of discovery that turned out to be as significant for Bowen’s theory as Freud’s self-analysis was for psychoanalysis.
<br>Bowen, the oldest of five children from a tightly knit rural family, kept his distance from his parents and the rest of his extended family. Like many of us, he mistook avoidance for emancipation.

<br>Unfinished emotional business stays with us, making us vulnerable to repeat conflicts we never worked out with our families


<br>Bowen’s most important achievement was detriangling himself from his parents, who’d been accustomed to complaining to him about each other

<br>Whitaker also pioneered the use of co-therapy, in the belief that a supportive partner helped free therapists to react without fear of countertransference. 
<br>In the Therapy Room:

<br>Never seemed to have an obvious strategy nor did he use predictable techniques.

<br>Robin Skynner (1976) introduced psychodynamic family therapy at the Institute of Family Therapy in London; British psychiatrist John Howells (1971) developed a system of family diagnosis as a necessary step for planning therapeutic intervention; and West German Helm Stierlin (1972) integrated psychodynamic and systemic ideas in treating troubled adolescents.  In Rome, Maurizio Andolfi worked with families early in the 1970s and established a training clinic that continues to accept clients and students today. In 1974 Andolfi also founded the Italian Society for Family Therapy; in Milan, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her colleagues founded the Institute for Family Studies in 1967.

<br>Leading influence on the decade of strategic therapy was exerted by Milton Erickson.

<br>Instead of grasping the principles on which they were predicated, many therapists just tried to imitate his “uncommon techniques.”
<br>To be any kind of competent therapist, you must keep your psychological distance from the supreme artists - the Minuchins, the Milton Ericksons, the Michael Whites. Otherwise you end up aping the magic of their styles rather than grasping the substance of their ideas.

<br>Making use of the cybernetic metaphor, strategic therapists zeroed in on how family systems were regulated by negative feedback. They achieved results simply by disrupting the interactions that maintained symptoms.

<br>The Postmodern Revolution:

<br>Postmodernism:

<br>family therapy models all had one thing in common: They each assumed there were certain “truths” about families and systems. Each model has embedded within it certain assumptions about the good life: what families should look like, how people should feel and act, and so forth




<br>Conclusion:

<br>Minuchin assumed that the hierarchical structure of a healthy family looked a certain way—parent(s) in charge, establishing order and providing for the family, while children remain subordinate, accommodating to family rules.

<br><br>
<br>The first and perhaps most influential model of how families operate was cybernetics, the study of feedback mechanisms in self-regulating systems.

<br>What a family shares with other cybernetic systems is a tendency to maintain stability by using information about its performance.
<br><a data-href="Feedback Loop" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/feedback-loop.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Feedback Loop</a>

<br>The process by which a system gets the information necessary to maintain a steady course. This feedback includes information about the system’s performance and the relationship among the system’s parts

<br>The process by which a system gets information necessary to maintain a steady course. 
<br>Includes information about the system's performance and the relationship among the system's parts. 
<br>If you see behavior that persists over time, there is likely something maintaining that behavior
<br>Feedback loops can be negative or positive, or the effect they have on homeostasis, not whether they are beneficial.

<br>Negative feedback indicates that a system is straying off the mark and that corrections

<br>A familiar example of negative feedback occurs in a home heating system.
<br>Early family therapists tended to overemphasize negative feedback and resistance to change.




<br><a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>:

<br>Reinforces the direction a system is taking. 
<br>Positive feedback can have desirable or undesirable consequences. If left unchecked, the reinforcing effects of positive feedback tend to compound a system's errors, leading to a runaway process. 

<br>Malignant worry, phobic avoidance, and other forms of neurotic behavior may start out with a relatively trivial concern and escalate into an out-of-control process. 

<br>Example: a panic attack may start out as a relatively harmless instance of being out of breath, but a panicky response to breathlessness may spiral into a terrifying experience.  






<br>Feedback loops indicate a basic circularity where each element has an effect on the next, until the last element 'feeds back' the cumulative effect into the first part of the cycle. Thus A affects B, which in turn affects C, which feeds back to A, and so on. 


<br>To survive and adapt to the world around them, all communication systems - including families - need a balance of negative and positive feedback. 
<br>The cybernetic system turned out to be a useful metaphor for describing how families maintain stability.


<br><br>
<br>Cybernetics was the brainchild of MIT mathematician Norbert Weiner (1948).

<br>During WWII, Weiner was asked to design a better way to control the targeting of antiaircraft artillery. Weiner's solution was to incorporate a system of internal feedback that enabled antiaircraft guns to regulare their own operations. The signal used to control the artillery was a self-regulating servomechanism - the technical term for the first automated machines.
<br>He distinguish two modes of information, discrete or continuous - digital or analog.

<br>Basic change in the structure and functioning of a system. 


<br><br>
<br>Part of their appeal was a pragmatic, problem-solving focus, but there was also a fascination with strategies to outwit and provoke families into changing, with or without their cooperation.

<br>It was this manipulativeness that eventually turned people against strategic therapy. 


<br>The strategic approach introduced two of the most powerful insights in family therapy:

<br>Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions.
<br>Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. 


<br><br>
<br>Strategic therapy grew out of the <a data-href="Communications Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/communications-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communications Theory</a> developed at the Bateson's schizophrenia project, which evolved into three distinct models: the MRI brief therapy, Haley and Madane's strategic therapy, and the Milan systemic model. 

<br>The birthplace of all three was the Mental Research Institute (MRI), where strategic therapy was inspired by <a data-href="Gregory Bateson" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/gregory-bateson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregory Bateson</a> and <a data-href="Milton Erikson" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/milton-erikson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Milton Erikson</a>, the anthropologist and the alienist.

<br>In The Art of Psychoanalysis, Haley redefined psychoanalysis as a game of one-upmanship.


<br>In 1967 Haley joined Salvador Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
<br>In 1976 Haley moved to Washington DC with Cloe Madanes he founded the Family Therapy Institute. Madanes currently works with motivational speaker and life coach Anthony Robbins. In 1955 Haley moved back to California. He dies in 2007. 

<br>Jame Keim in California, who developed an innovative way of working with oppositional children, is ably carrying on the Haley-Madanes tradition. Other prominent practitioners of this model include Neil Schiffin Washington DC; Scott Sells at the Savannah Family Institute; and Jerome Price in Michigan. 


<br>The MRI model had a major impact on the Milan Associates, Mara Selvini Palazzoli, Luigi Boscolo, Gianfranco Cecchin, and Guiliana Prata. 

<br>The Milan Associates eventually split, with Palazzoli and Prata focusing on invariant prescriptions and eventually incorporating more psycho analytic concepts into their work, and Boscolo and Cecchin focusing on circular questioning. Both groups currently have training centers in Italy. 
<br>Giorgio Nardone is another prominent Italian family therapist who trained at the MRI. 


<br><br>
<br>In Pragmatics of Human Communication Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson sought to develop a calculus of human communication, which they stated in a series of axioms. 

<br>People are always communicating. 

<br>Since all behavior is communicative and since one cannot not behave, then it follows that one cannot not communicate. 


<br>All messages have report and command functions.

<br>The report (or content) of a message conveys information, while the command is a statement about the relationship.

<br>In families, command messages are patterned as <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>, which can be deduced from repeated patterns of interaction. 
<br>Jackson used the term <a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a> as a description of regularity, not regulation. 

<br>Nobody lays down the rules, families generally are unaware of them. 




<br><a data-href="Family Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/family-homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Homeostasis</a>:

<br>The rules, or regulations, of family interaction operate to preserve family stability. 
<br>Homeostatic mechanisms bring families back to equilibrium in the fae of disruption and thus serve to resist change. 
<br>Jackson's notion of family homeostasis describes the conservative aspect of family systems and is similar to the cybernetic concept of <a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>. 

<br>According to the communication analysis, families operate as goal-directed, rule-governed systems. 
<br>Communications theorists didn’t look for underlying motives; instead, they assumed circular causality and analyzed patterns of communications linked together in chains of stimulus and response as feedback loops. 

<br>When the response to a family member’s problematic behavior exacerbates the problem, that chain is seen as a positive feedback loop.
<br>The advantage of this formulation is that it focuses on interactions that perpetuate problems, which can be changed, instead of inferring underlying causes, which are often not subject to change.




<br><a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>:

<br>Strategic therapists made the concept of the positive feedback loop the centerpieve of the model. 

<br>For the MRI group, this translated into a simple yet powerful principle of problem formation:

<br>Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how family members respond to it. 

<br>Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This only produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, and so on - in a vicious cycle. 
<br>The family system is reacting to a deviation in the behavior of one of its members within feedback designed to dampen that deviation (<a data-href="Negative Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/negative-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Feedback</a>), but has the effect of amplifying the deviation (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a>).










<br>In most families, unspoken rules govern all sorts of behavior  

<br>Where a rule promotes the kind of rigid attempted solution described above, it is not just the behavior but the rule that needs to change. 
<br>When only a specific behavior within a system changes, this is <a data-href="First-Order Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">First-Order Change</a>
<br>When the rules of the system change, this is <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a>.

<br>The MRI approach:

<br>Identify feedback loops that maintain problems
<br>Determine the rules that support those interactions
<br>Find a way to change the rules in order to interrupt problem-maintaining behavior. 




<br>Jay Haley added a functionalist emphasis to the cybernetic interpretation with his interest in the interpersonal payoff of behavior. Later, he incorporated structural concepts developed during the years he spent with Minuchin. 
<br><a data-href="Hierarchical Structure" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchical-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Structure</a>:

<br>Haley believed that the rules around the hierarchical structure of a family are crucial and found inadequate parental hierarchies lurking behind most problems. 

<br>Haley suggested that 'an individual is more disturbed in direct proportion to the number of malfunctioning hierarchies in which he is embedded.'

<br>To counter a problem's payoff, Haley borrowed Erickson's technique of <a data-href="Prescribing Ordeals" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/prescribing-ordeals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prescribing Ordeals</a>, so that the price for keeping a symptom outweighed that of giving it up. 






<br>Like Haley, Mara Selvini Palazzoli and her associates focused on power games in families and on the protective function symptoms served for a family. 

<br>They explored families' histories over several generations, searching for evidence to confirm their hypotheses about how children's symptoms came to be necessary. These hypotheses often involved elaborate networks of family alliances and coalitions. 

<br>They frequently concluded that patients developed symptoms to protect one or more family members so as to maintain the delicate network of extended family alliances. 




<br><br>
<br>Strategic therapists say little more than whatever works is normal and that what makes families malfunction are solutions that don't work. 
<br><br>
<br>According to <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>, normal  families, like all living systems, depend on two processes:

<br>They maintain integrity in the face of environmental challenges through negative feedback. No living system can survive without a coherent structure. 

<br>Negative feedback resists disruptions


<br>Too rigid a structure leaves a system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. That is why normal families also have mechanisms of positive feedback.

<br>Positive feedback amplifies innovations to accommodate to changed circumstances. 


<br>Recognizing that the channel for feedback is communication makes it possible to state the case more plainly:

<br>Healthy families are able to adapt because they communicate clearly and are flexible.

<br>According to communications theory, the essential function of symptoms is to maintain the homeostatic equilibrium of family systems. 

<br>Symptomatic families were seen as trapped in dysfunctional, homeostatic patterns of communication. 

<br>These families cling to their rigid ways and respond to signs of change as negative feedback. Change is treated not as an opportunity for growth but as a threat. 




<br>There are three explanations of how problems develop:

<br>Cybernetic:

<br>Difficulties are turned into chronic problems by misguided solutions, forming positive feedback escalations.

<br>One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. 
<br>Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families usually seek help for a specific problem. 

<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. 


<br>What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions.

<br>To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. 

<br>Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. 


<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. 

<br>Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. 


<br>Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. 

<br>Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. 
<br>Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. 

<br>To understand these patterns, two things are necessary:

<br>A theoretical system that explains structure
<br>Seeking the family in action

<br>Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. 










<br>Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. 

<br>Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. 

<br>Rigid boundaries:

<br>Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. 


<br>Clear Boundary:

<br>Normal range.


<br>Diffuse Boundaries:

<br>Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. 






<br>Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. 

<br>The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. 

<br>Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. 


<br>Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. 

<br>The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. 

<br>A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. 

<br>Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. 


<br>In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. 








<br>Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. 
<br><br>
<br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. 

<br>The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. 
<br>In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. 


<br>Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. 

<br>Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. 


<br>Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. 
<br>The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem.

<br>Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. 


<br>Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. 

<br>Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. 

<br>Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. 




<br><br>
<br>Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. 

<br>Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. 

<br>In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. 

<br>If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. 


<br>In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. 

<br>Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. 

<br>A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family."






<br>Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. 


<br>Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. 

<br>One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. 
<br>An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. 

<br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>.




<br>Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. 

<br>If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. 

<br>Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. 




<br>Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. 

<br>The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. 


<br>An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. 

<br>Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. 


<br><br>
<br>Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. 
<br>The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. 
<br>Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. 

<br>Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. 


<br>Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. 
<br>With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. 
<br>With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. 
<br><br>
<br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. 

<br>To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. 

<br>Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. 




<br>The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. 
<br>Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. 
<br>Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. 

<br>It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. 


<br>Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. 
<br>Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. 

<br>"Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them."


<br>Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. 

<br>To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. 

<br>The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. 




<br>Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps:

<br>Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
<br>Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. 
<br>A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. 
<br>Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. 

<br>Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. 

<br>The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. 






<br><br>
<br>In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist:

<br>Joins the family in a position of leadership.
<br>Maps the family's underlying structure.
<br>Intervenes to transform this structure. 


<br>In general, structural family therapy follows these steps:

<br>Joining and accommodating
<br>Enactment
<br>Structural Mapping
<br>Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
<br>Boundary Making
<br>Unbalancing
<br>Challenging Unproductive Assumptions


<br><br>
<br>Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. 

<br>The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. 

<br>Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. 




<br>The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. 

<br>A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. 

<br>Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. 


<br>Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. 
<br>Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. 

<br>Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up.




<br><br>
<br>Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. 
<br>If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. 
<br>Working with enactments requires three operations:

<br>The therapist notices a problematic sequence. 
<br>The therapist initiates an enactment. 
<br>The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. 


<br>Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. 
<br>Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. 
<br>When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways:

<br>Commenting on what went wrong
<br>Pushing them to keep going


<br><br>
<br>Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. 
<br>Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. 

<br>It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. 


<br>Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. 
<br><br>
<br>Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. 
<br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>.

<br>Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. 


<br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
<br>Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. 

<br>Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. 


<br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. 

<br>Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. 


<br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a>

<br>Another method of modifying interactions. 
<br>Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. 

<br>A sense of timing helps. 




<br><br>
<br>In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. 
<br>Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. 
<br>Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. 

<br>When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. 


<br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>.
<br><br>
<br>In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. 
<br>Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - 
<br><br>
<br>Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. 
<br>Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. 
<br>Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. 
<br><br>
<br>Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. 
<br>Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. 

<br>Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. 

<br>These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. 




<br>The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. 

<br>The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. 


<br>Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. 
<br>Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. 

<br>Example:

<br>Families of the Slums by Minuchin




<br>Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. 

<br>Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. 


<br>Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. 
<br>Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. 

<br>Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. 


<br>Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. 

<br>A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. 


<br><br>
<br>The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions.
<br><br>
<br>The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. 

<br>Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. 


<br>Subsystems are units of the family based on function. 

<br>Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. 


<br>Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. 
<br>After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves.

<br>A system of rewards using points, which can be accumulated and exchanged for reinforcing items or behaviors.


<br>When they first began working with families, behavior therapists applied learning theory to train parents in behavior modification and teach communication skills to couples. 
<br><br>
<br>The early principles of behavior therapy were developed by two key figures: <a data-href="Joseph Wolpe" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/joseph-wolpe.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joseph Wolpe</a> and <a data-href="B. F. Skinner" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/b.-f.-skinner.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">B. F. Skinner</a>.

<br>In 1948, Wolpe introduced systematic desensitization.

<br>Systematic desensitization deconditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition by pairing responses incompatible with anxiety to previously anxiety-arousing stimuli. 


<br>Skinner's <a data-href="Operant Conditioning" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/operant-conditioning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Operant Conditioning</a>:

<br>Behavior is regulated by its consequences. Responses that are positively reinforced will be increased; those that are punished or ignored will be extinguished.
<br>The operant conditioner carefully observes target behavior and quantifies its frequency and rate. Then, to complete a functional analysis of behavior, the consequences of the behavior are noted to determine the contingencies of reinforcement. 
<br>Operant conditioning is particularly effective with children because parents have control over their rewards and punishment. Gerald Patterson, at the Oregon Social Learning Center pioneered behavioral parent training. Patterson's treatment was based on the premise that if parents change their contingencies of reinforcement, then their children's behavior will change. 


<br><a data-href="Shaping" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping</a>:

<br>Skills taught in sequence. 
<br>Teach parents to reinforce prosocial behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts. This process also promotes positive relationships between parents and children. Children earn rewards while they learn prosocial skills, and in the process, their self-esteem grows with their success and their parents' positive attention. 


<br><a data-href="Gerald Patterson" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-figures/gerald-patterson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gerald Patterson</a>:

<br>Took the lead in introducing disciplinary techniques, such as time-out, because he discovered that ignoring the problem behavior is not always sufficient, especially with aggressive children. 




<br>During the 1970s, behavioral and emotional responses, along with the interpersonal transactions that occur within their family, social, vocational, political, and culture networks. 
<br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a>:

<br>Refers to those approaches inspired by the work of Albert Ellis (1962) and Aaron Beck (1976) that emphasize the need for attitude change to promote behavior modification.

<br>According to the cognitive mediation model, emotions and actions are mediated by specific cognitions. 

<br>Understanding these cognitions (beliefs, attributions, and expectancies) makes it possible to identify factors that trigger dysfunctional emotional and behavioral patterns. 

<br>This boils down to uncovering hidden assumptions that keep people stuck. 






<br>Rational-emotive therapists help family members see how illogical beliefs serve as the foundation for their emotional distress. According to the A-B-C Theory, family members blame their problems on certain events in the family (a) and are taught to look for irrational beliefs (b), which are then challenged (c). 

<br>The therapist's role is to teach the family how emotional problems are caused by unrealistic beliefs and that by revising these self-defeating ideas, they may improve the quality of family life. 
<br>Cognitions, emotions, and behavior are seen as exerting mutual influence on one another, so that a cognitive inference can evoke emotion and behavior, and emotion and behavior can influence cognition. 


<br>The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the cognitive behavior approach applied more widely in family therapy. 

<br>Edited books by Epstein, Schlesinger, and Dryden (1988) and a short text by Huber and Baruth (1989) were among the first works to address the cognitive approach to family therapy. This was elaborated in subsequent articles by Schwebel and Fine (1992), Dattilio (1994, 1997), and Teichman (1992). Dattilio (1998) produced a major casebook that discusses the integration of cognitive-behavioral strategies with various modalities of couples and family therapy, as well as a comprehensive textbook describing the cognitive-behavioral approach (Dattilio, 2010). Among the leaders in cognitive-behavioral family therapy are Donald Baucom at the University of North Carolina, Norman Epstein at the University of Maryland, and Frank Dattilio at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania.




<br><br>
<br>The basic premise of behaviorism is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. 

<br>Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers; those that decrease behavior are punishers. 


<br>Some responses may not be recognized as operants - something done to get something - because people aren't away of the reinforcing payoffs. 
<br>Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>, according to which people strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. In a successful relationship, partners work to maximize mutual rewards. In successful relationships from getting hurt to consider how to make each other happy.

<br>Integrate stimulus-response behaviorism with cognitive theories. The central tenet of the cognitive approach is that our interpretation of other people's behavior affects the way we respond to them. 

<br>Among the most troublesome of automatic thoughts are those based on arbitrary inference, distorted conclusions, shaped by a person's <a data-href="Schemas" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/schemas.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schemas</a>, or core beliefs. What makes these underlying beliefs problematic is that although they are generally conscious, they bias how we respond to everything and everyone.




<br><br>
<br>Hidden assumptions have a potent impact on how people perceive and react to each other. 
<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Behavior Exchange Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/behavior-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavior Exchange Theory</a>:

<br>A good relationship is one in which giving and getting are balanced - or, in the model's terms, there is a high ratio of benefits to costs. Thus it is the balance of costs and rewards that determines family satisfaction. 


<br>Weiss and Isaac (1978) found that affection, communication, and child care are the most important elements in marital satisfaction. Earlier, Wills, Weiss, and Patterson (1974) found that unpleasant behavior reduced marital satisfaction more than positive behavior increased it. 

<br>Good relationships are under positive reinforcement control.


<br>A critical skill in maintaining family harmony is conflict resolution. 

<br>Some people assume that good relationships will evolve naturally if people love each other. Behaviorists emphasize the need to develop relationship skills.  


<br>Neil Jacobson (1981):

<br>Successful couples... Expand their reinforcement power by frequently acquiring new domains for positive exchange. Spouses who depend on a limited quantity and variety of reinforcers are bound to suffer the ill effects of satiation. As a result, over time their interaction becomes depleted of its prior reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement value. Successful couples cope with this inevitable reinforcement erosion by varying their shared activities, developing new common interests, expanding their sexual repertoires, and developing their communication to the point where they continue to interest one another. 


<br><br>
<br>Behaviorists view symptoms as learned responses. They look for specific responses that reinforce problem behavior. 
<br>People often aren't aware that they reinforce those responses that cause them the most distress. 

<br>Attention is a powerful social reinforcer.


<br>The problem is most parents have trouble ignoring misbehavior. 

<br>E.g. How quickly children learn that certain words get a big reaction. (some of these children grow up to become stand-up comedians)
<br>Even when parents try to ignore misbehavior, they usually don't do so consistently. This can make things worse, because intermittent reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction.
<br>Others persist because parents don't know how to make effective use of punishment. They make threats they don't follow through on; they punish too long after the fact; they use punishments so mild as to have no effect; or they use punishments so severe as to generate more anxiety than learning. 

<br>A spiral of undesirable behavior is maintained by reciprocal reinforcement. 

<br>Parents often unintentionally reinforce temper tantrums by giving in or merely by giving the tantruming child extra attention. 






<br>The use of <a data-href="Aversion Control" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/aversion-control.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aversion Control</a> - crying, nagging, withdrawing - is a major determinant of marital unhappiness. Spouses tend to reciprocate their partners' use of aversive behavior, and a viscous cycle develops. 

<br>People in distressed relationships also show poor problem-solving skills.


<br>Most behavioral analyses point to a lack of reinforcement for positive behavior in distressed families. ('The squeaky wheel gets the grease')

<br>Depression, headaches, and tempter tantrums tend to elicit concern and therefore get more attention than pleasant behavior. 


<br>The schemas that plague relationships are learned in the process of growing up.

<br><br>
<br>Cognitive restructuring is useful to the extent that it leads to changed behavior, which can be reinforced. 
<br><br>
<br>The general intent is to extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. 
<br>Soemtimes it may be necessary to redefine a family's goal of decreasing negative behavior in terms of increasing incompatible, positive responses. 

<br>Most people have difficulty describing behavior they want their mates to accelerate. 


<br>Cognitive-behavior therapy also has an educational agenda. Cognitive-behaviorists also teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. These therapists not only help clients reexamine distorted beliefs to solve specific complaints but also make an effort to teach families how to use cognitive strategies to resolve problems in the future. 
<br><br>
<br>The basic premise of behavior therapy is that behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. Behavioral family therapy aims to resolve targeted family problems through identifying behavioral goals, learning theory techniques for achieving these goals, and social reinforcers to facilitate this process. 

<br>The first task of the therapist is to observe the frequency of behavior as well as the stimulus conditions that precede it and the reinforcement that follows it. In addition to the reinforcing responses that immediately follow a specific behavior, more remote reinforcers also play a part. 

<br>Behavior that is reinforced by peers may be difficult to modify at home. 




<br>The primary approach in behavioral parent training is operant conditioning, where the reinforcers employed may be tangible or social. 

<br>Praise and attention have been found to be as effective as money or candy. 
<br>Operant techniques may be further divided into shaping, token economies, contingency contracting, contingency management, and time-out.

<br>Punishment where children are made to sit in the corner or sent to their rooms. 


<br>Barton and Alexander call their approach functional family therapy

<br>Point out that members of unhappy families tend to attribute their problems to negative traits in others. 

<br>Such negative attributions leave family members with a limited sense of control over their lives. 




<br>Restructuring distorted beliefs is thought to play a pivotal role in changing dysfunctional behavior. Uncovering and reevaluating schemas, or core beliefs, of family members is thought to be essential in helping them modify emotions and interactions that surround problem behavior. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Most assessments are based on Kanfer and Phillip's (1970) SORKC model of behavior.

<br>S for stimulus
<br>O for the state of the organism
<br>R for the target response
<br>KC for the contingency of consequences

<br>Applying the SORKC model is straightforward, but it quickly becomes more complex with families, in which there are long chains of interrelated behavior. 




<br>Assessment in behavioral parent training entails observing and recording the frequency of the behavior to be changed, as well as the events that precede it and those that follow. Interviews, usually with the mother, are designed to provide a definition of the problem and a list of potential reinforcers. Observations may be conducted behind a one-way mirror or during home visits. 
<br><br>
<br>Once the assessment is complete, the therapist decides which behaviors should be increased and which decreased. 

<br>To accelerate behavior, the <a data-href="Premack Principle" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Premack Principle" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premack Principle</a> is applied.

<br>High probability behavior (popular activities) is chosen to reinforce behavior with a low probability of occurrence. 

<br>As the Premack principle demonstrates, to be effective, reinforcers must be popular with the child. 






<br>Once effective rewards are chosen, parents are taught to shape desired behavior by reinforcing successive approximation to their goals. They are taught to raise the criteria for reinforcement gradually and to present reinforcement immediately after the desired behavior. Once a child is regularly performing the desired response, reinforcement becomes intermittent in order to increase the durability of the new behavior. 

<br>The importance of immediate proximity is what makes time-out such an effective punishment and grounding such an ineffective one. 
<br>Disciplinary techniques are usually instituted after the progress has been made in reinforcing positive behavior. For preadolescent children, the most widely used punishment is time-out. 

<br><a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a> involves removal to a boring place for five minutes. 

<br>Older children are sent to graduate school and required to sit through lectures. 


<br>When a child refuses to go to time-out, parents are taught to add additional time, up to a 10-minute maximum. If the child continues to refuse, a privilege's is removed. 




<br>Other techniques used to decelerate behavior include verbal reprimand and ignoring. Simply repeating commands to children is the most ineffective way to change their behavior. 

<br>Chores are broken down into steps with points given for each step. Rewards include food treats, special time with a parent, household resources (e.g. computer or TV time), privileges, and toys. Rewards are changed reguarly to keep things interesting.


<br>Because of the inconvenience of reinforcing behavior immediately, token systems have been popular with parent trainers. Points are earned for desirable behavior and lost for undesireable behavior.
<br>Case Study:

<br>Ignore fits of temper whenever they occurred. If they occurred at bedtime, child was to be put to bed; if they continued to cry and fuss, they was to be left alone until they have stopped. Only when they stopped were their parents to talk with them about what was on her mind.

<br>The tantrums indeed decreased, except for one night when they took on a new and more troubling form. 




<br>With teenagers, contingency contracting is more widely used. Contracting is introduced as a way for everybody in the family to get something by compromising. Parents and teenagers are asked to specify what behavior they'd like each other to change. These requests form the nucleus of an initial contract. In order to help family members arrive at contracts, the therapist encourages (1) clear communication of wishes and feelings, (2) clear presentation of requests, leading to (3) negotiation, with each person receiving something in exchange for some concession.

<br>Assessments are designed to reveal strengths and weaknesses of a couple's relationship and the manner in which rewards and punishments are exchanged. Interviews and questionnaires are used to specify and elaborate target behaviors. 
<br>Jacobson's (1981) Pretreatment Assessment for Marital Therapy:

<br>Strengths and skills of the relationship:

<br>What are the major strengths of this relationship?
<br>What behaviors on the part of each spouse are highly valued by the other?
<br>What shared activities does the couple currently engage in?


<br>Presenting Problems:

<br>What are the major complaints, and how do these complaints translate into explicit behavioral terms?
<br>What are the reinforcers maintaining these behaviors?
<br>What behaviors occur at less than the desired frequency or fail to occur at appropriate times from the standpoint of each spouse?
<br>What are the consequences of these behaviors currently, when they occur?


<br>Sex and Affection:

<br>Is either spouse currently dissatisfied with rate, quality, or diversity of sex life together?
<br>If sex is currently a problem, was there a time when it was mutually satisfying?
<br>What are the sexual behaviors that seem to be associated with current dissatisfaction?
<br>Are either or both partners dissatisfied with the amount or quality of nonsexual physical affection?


<br>Future Prospects:

<br>Are the partners seeking therapy to improve their relationship, to separate, or to decide whether the relationship is worth working on?
<br>What are each spouse's reasons for continuing the relationship despite the current problems?


<br>Assessment of Social Environment:

<br>What are each person's alternatives to the present relationship?
<br>How attractive are these alternatives to each person?
<br>Is the environment (parents, relatives, friends, work associates, children) supportive of either continuance or dissolution of present relationship?


<br>Individual Functioning of Each Spouse:

<br>Does either spouse exhibit emotional or behavioral problems?
<br>Have they been in therapy before, either alone or together? What kind of therapy? Outcome?
<br>What is each spouse's past experience with intimate relationships?
<br>How is the present relationship difference?

<br>Richard Stuart (1975) lists five strategies that summarize the behavioral approach to troubled marriages:

<br>Couples are taught to express themselves in a clear, behavior descriptions rather than in vague complaints.
<br>Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive control in place of aversive control. 
<br>Couples are helped to improve their communication. 
<br>Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and making decisions. 
<br>Couples are taught strategies for solving future problems as a means to maintain and extend gains initiated in therapy. 


<br>Behavior exchange theory procedures are taught to increase the frequency of desired behavior. A typical device is to ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. 

<br>Couples are implicitly learning ways of influencing each other through positive reinforcement. Stuart (1976) has couples alternate 'caring days,' where on partner demonstrates caring in as many ways as possible. 


<br>Gottman and Krokoff (1989) found that arguments and angry exchanges, which have often been considered destructive to relationships, may not be harmful in the long run. These patterns were correlated with immediate dissatisfaction but were predictive of improved satisfaction after 3 years. 

<br>Defensiveness, stubbornness, and withdrawal from conflict, on the other hand, did lead to long-term deterioration in marriages. 
<br>Confrontation is effective only if it doesn't make the partner defensive. It isn't just honesty that counts but honesty expressed in a way the partner can tolerate. 


<br>Training in communication skills may be done in a group format or with individual groups. Couples are taught to be specific, phrase requests in positive terms, respond directly to criticism instead of cross-complaining, talk about the present and future rather than the past, listen without interruption, minimize punitive statements, and eliminate questions that sound like declarations.

<br>The late Steve de Shazer was the founder of solution-focused therapy.

<br>A scholar as well as a clinician, de Shazer was intrigued by <a data-href="Gregory Bateson" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/gregory-bateson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregory Bateson</a> theories of communication and Milton Erickson's pragmatic ideas about how to influence change.

De Shazer dies in Vienna on September 11th, 2005.


<br>Insoo Kim Berg was one of the primary architects of the solution-focused approach.

<br>Applied model to a variety of problems and service settings, including alcoholism, marital therapy, and family-based services to the poor. She died in 2007.

<br>Other well known solution-focused therapists include Eve Lipchik, Scott Miller, John Walter, and Jane Peller.

<br><br>
<br>Like the MRI group, solution-focused therapists believe that people are constrained by narrow views of their problems into perpetuating rigid patterns of false solutions. 

<br>O'Hanlon and Weiner-Davis (1989):

<br>So, the meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. If the methods used do not produce a satisfactory outcome, the original assumption about the meaning of the behavior is generally not questioned... Instead, people often redouble their efforts to solve the problem in an ineffective way, thinking that by doing it more, harder or better (e.g. more punishments, more heart-to-heart talks, and so on) they will finally solve it.




<br>The MRI model was inspired by Milton Erickson's view of people as containing cast reservoirs of untapped creativity. According to this view, people may need only a shift of perspective to release their potential. Part of that shift involves changing the way people talk about their problems.

<br>The language of problems tend to be different from the language of solutions. 

<br>The language of solutions is more hopeful and future oriented. Part of a therapist's job is to steer clients from problem talk to solution talk. In the solution-focused model, the future is negotiable.




<br><br>
<br>The more you emphasize family dynamics, the more you see people embedded in a network of connections that constrain their actions. Solution-focused therapists pay less attention to the forces controlling family members because they see people as relatively fluid and changeable - and they treat them that way in therapy.
<br><br>
<br>In the solution-focused model, clients are assumed to be the experts on their own lives. 

<br>"Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?"
<br>"If as a practitioner, you wish to put clients into the position of being experts on their own lives, you will have to know how to set aside your own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of your clients."


<br>Solution-focused therapists assume that people are resourceful. The problems they have are not seen as evidence of failure but rather as normal life-cycle complications.

<br>It can be seen as a commitment to the belief that families have the ability to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. 


<br>Implicit in this model is an asymptomatic perspective on family normality; that is, a normal family is simply one that has been freed of its presenting problems and thus returned to its own unique functional way of living. 

<br>"Solution-oriented therapists don't believe that there is any single 'correct' or 'valid' way to live one's life. We have come to understand that what is unacceptable behavior in one family or for one person is desirable behavior in another. Therefore, clients, not therapists, identify the goals to be accomplished in treatment.


<br><br>
<br>The very act of categorizing people suggests they are a certain way all the time. 

<br>Solution-focused therapists steer clients away from speculating about problem formation, they also avoid such conjecture themselves. Their conviction is that solutions are often unrelated to the way problems developed and that exploring etiology is engaging in problem talk - exactly what they seek to avoid. They believe that problem-focused thinking keeps people from discovering effective solutions. Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking.


<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapy works by setting clear goals and building on exceptions to problems. 
<br>Good therapy is never a simple matter of implementing a few specific techniques. It is - or should be - a complicated enterprise involving all the elements that make helping relationships work. 
<br><br>
<br>The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting complaint as expeditiously as possible. The search for underlying flaws is rejected. 
<br>Solution-focused therapists don't believe it's necessary to delve into these deeper issues in order to help people resolve their problems. The goal is never about how families should be structure but only what they want different in their lives. 
<br>The process of goal setting itself is an important intervention in this approach. 

<br>It is important to assist client in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. Helping people to stop dwelling on their dissatisfactions and envision what they want to be doing instead is seen as the first step in helping them get there. 


<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapy works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems - effective solutions already in their repertoire. What's needed for change is a shift in the way a problem is 'languaged':

<br>"What we talk about and how we talk about it makes a difference, and it is these differences that can be used to make a difference to the client."


<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished because 'as the client and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in the truth of reality of what they are talking about. This is the way language works, naturally.'

<br>This is why solution-focused therapy can be so brief:

<br>It's a lot easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior. The assumption is that getting them to talk positively to solve their problems. 




<br><br><br>
<br>After getting a brief description of the presenting complaint, solution-focused practitioners move directly to asking clients how things will be different in their lives when their problems are solved. Then, instead of formulating some kind of intervention plan, the therapist asks about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. 
<br>The following questions suggest the proactive nature of a solution-focused assessment:

<br>"What do you think the problem is now?"
<br>"How will you know when the problem is solved?"
<br>"How will you know you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?"
<br>"What will have to be different for that to happen in terms of your behavior, thoughts, and feelings?"
<br>"What will you notice that is different about others involved in the situation?"
<br>"What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?"


<br>They say that anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions. They also need little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand. Solution-focused therapists ask more about perceptions than about feelings. And they affirm the clients' position. All clients want some indication that their therapist has understood the point of view that guides their actions. 

<br>The solution-focused therapist doesn't function as an expert in determining what's wrong (enmeshment, triangulation) and planning how to correct it. 

<br>Clients are the experts on what they want to change. 


<br>Although solution-focused therapists don't play the role of an authority figure who will help clients solve their problems, they do take an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. 

<br>The following sorts of questions are asked to lay the groundwork for therapeutic goal development:

<br>"What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?"
<br>"What needs to happen so that this will not have been a waste of your time?"
<br>"Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problem that brought you here today?"


<br>Based on the answers to these questions, the therapist and clients begin to construct a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. Once this description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the clients to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represents the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone or the clients are coping with it so well that it is no longer problematic. 

<br>The clients' rating makes it possible to assess how far they are from the goal. Later, the same scale can be used to determine what specific actions will allow the clients to move toward the goal and to evaluate progress. If the clients identify new problems, the therapist makes a new scale to depict desired outcomes and to assess progress toward new solutions. 






<br>Practitioners distinguish between visitors, complainants, and customers. 

<br><a data-href="Visitor" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/visitor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Visitor</a>s:

<br>Someone who's not really in the market for therapy.
<br>Visitors are there at someone else's insistence, but they don't really have a complaint and don't want to be there. Therapists should not offer any suggestions to these clients or seek to convince them that they really need therapy. 
<br>It is important to pay attention to how they were referred and to consider who the real client is - the individual who wants something to change.
<br>If the people in your office are present only because someone pressured them to be there, a useful strategy is to ask them what they need to do to satisfy the authority that compelled them to seek therapy. 

<br>"So, what has to happen to get your mother off your back?"
<br>"What's the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?"




<br><a data-href="Complainant" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complainant.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complainant</a>s:

<br>They have clear complaints, but they're usually about someone else. 
<br>It may be useful to suggest noticing exceptions in the problem behavior of the other family member. The solution-focused therapist accepts the complainant's views, gives compliments, and may suggest observing exceptions to the complaint pattern. 
<br>With such clients, solution-focused therapists try to shift the conversation from problem talk to solution talk. 

<br>"How were you hoping I might be useful to you?"

<br>Then strategize with them about how they can act differently to influence those recalcitrant others. 






<br><a data-href="Customer" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/customer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Customer</a>s:

<br>They have clear complaints and are ready to take action. With a customer, you can move directly to establish goals and look for solutions. 

<br>These distinctions are not qualities of character but qualities of the therapeutic relationship and therefore fluid. With an apparently unmotivated complainant, a therapist's job is to engage in a solution-focused conversation, compliment the client, and possibly give an assignment to observe exceptions to the problem. 

<br>By not pushing for change but instead shifting attention away from problems and toward solutions, the relationship may evolve into one in which the client becomes a customer for change. 








<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused techniques are organized around two fundamental strategies:

<br>Developing well-focused goals within the clients' frame of reference. 
<br>Generating solutions based on exceptions.


<br>Therapy is usually brief (3-5 sessions), and appointments are made one at a time, on the assumption that one more may be enough. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem: "How were you hoping I could help you?" Solution-focused therapists take pains to work within the clients' frame of reference. They ask for the clients' perceptions and are careful to acknowledge them, using the clients' own language as much as possible. 
<br>It is a good idea to ask clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. People usually attempt various strategies to deal with their problems, and these efforts may have been more or less successful. Either way, these previous attempts at solution now play an important part in the clients' perception of what works and doesn't work for them.
<br><br>
<br>The next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. Solution-focused therapists help translate vague or amorphous goals into specific, behavioral terms by asking questions like:

<br>"Specifically how will you be doing this?"
<br>"How will the two of you know when you have solved your problems? How will things be different?"
<br>"What will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else?"


<br>The clearer the goal, the easier it is to measure progress. 

<br>"What will you be doing differently?"
<br>Part of the process of solution-focused therapy is helping clients think about constructive actions they can take rather than how they can get someone else to change. Useful goals are specific and include positive actions. They are also modest enough to be achievable. 


<br><a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a>:

<br>"Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened and the problem which brought you here is solved? "
<br>The miracle question invites clients to envision positive outcomes and begins to activate a problem-solving mind-set by giving them a mental picture of their goals. 
<br>The miracle question also helps clients look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do the things that the problem has been obstructing. If the therapist can encourage them to begin doing those things despite the problem, suddenly the problem may not loom as large. 


<br><br>
<br>Probing for exceptions - times when clients did not have the problem - invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. Such probing involves asking <a data-href="Exception Question" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/exception-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Exception Question</a>s like these:

<br>"When in the recent past might the problem have happened but did not (or was less intense or more manageable)?"
<br>"What's different about those times when the problem does not happen?"
<br>"How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you?"


<br>Finding the exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail. Also, and since these exceptions just happened, it's more plausible that they could happen again. By exploring these times and what was different about them, clients find clues to what they can do to expand these exceptions. 
<br>Exploring exceptions allows the therapist and client to build on past successes. Failing that, the therapist can ask why things are not worse - "How did you manage that?" - and then build on that accomplishment. 

<br><a data-href="Coping Questions" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coping-questions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coping Questions</a>:

<br>Can help clients recognize that simply by enduring, they are more resourceful than they realize:

<br>"What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?"
<br>"How come things are not worse?"
<br>"What have you done to keep them from getting worse?"


<br>If the client provides answers, the therapist can build on them with questions about how that endurance can be maintained and how more of that effort can be brought to bear. 




<br>A solution-focused therapist spends most of the session listening for evidence of previous solutions, exceptions, and goals. When such evidence comes out, the therapist punctuates it with enthusiasm and support. The therapist then works to keep solution talk in the forefront. 
<br><br>
<br>Scaling questions were introduced to help therapists and clients talk about vague topics such a depression and communication, where it is difficult to identify concrete changes. 

<br>"The therapists asks the depressed client, for example, "On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now?"

<br>The therapist and client can recognize and nurture small changes toward the goal rather than being stuck. 




<br>Scaling questions are also used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. "On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that.. this week?"

<br>This device has a kind of 'prove-it' implication. The response is followed up by asking clients what they might do to increase the odds of success: "What do you have to do to stick to your guns this time?" 


<br>Asking scaling questions is a useful way of anticipating and disarming resistance and backsliding and of encouraging commitment to change. 
<br>This intervention has two major components:

<br>It is a solution-focused assessment device. If it is used each session, the therapist and clients have an ongoing measure of progress. 
<br>It is a powerful intervention by itself because it allows the therapist to focus on previous solutions and exceptions and to punctuate new changes as they occur. 

<br>Like the changes made before the first session, one of three things can happen between each session:

<br>Things can get better

<br>If things get better from one session to the next, the therapist compliments the clients and then gets details about how they were able to make such changes. This not only supports and solidifies the changes but also nudges clients to do more of the same. 


<br>Things can stay the same

<br>If things stay the same, the clients can be complimented on maintaining their changes or for not letting things get worse: "How did you keep it from going down?" The therapist can again compliment and support and encourage more of that change. 


<br>Things can get worse






<br><br>
<br>Compliments are conveyed with questions:

<br>"Wow! How did you do that?"

<br>Phrasing calls attention to the fact that the clients have already accomplished something. Doing so invites clients to describe their successes and thus helps foster self-confidence. 




<br>To be effective, <a data-href="Compliments" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/compliments.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Compliments</a> should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. Most clients know what is wrong but have run out of ideas about how to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. 
<br>Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work. 
<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapy is often practiced in a team approach, with a therapist in the session and colleagues observing behind the mirror. Whether working with a team or alone, the therapist usually takes a 10-minute break near the end of the session. During this time, the therapist (with the team or alone) composes a summary message to the clients. 

<br>The session break can be used to promote a collaborative mind-set:

<br>"We're nearing the end of the session and I would like to take a 10-minute break. This is to give you time to think and reflect about what we have discussed; to pick out any important ideas came up, or to make decisions or plans. You might also like to think about whether this session has been useful and how you would like us to be further involved, if that would be helpful. While you are thinking, I will consult with my team for their thoughts. We will think together about what you said. When we get back together, I will be interested to hear what stood out for you today. I will also share the teams' thoughts with you. Together, then, we can put something together that will be helpful."




<br>The summary message begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the clients' goals, and pre-session progress and strengths: "What I have hear you tell me today..."

<br>This recap is followed by a statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy, a reflection of the emotional impact on the client, compliments on pre-session changes or strengths, and some comment on the client's goals. 

<br>The therapist then makes suggestions about building positives. Among the suggestions used commonly in solution-focused therapy are the following:

<br>The formula first-session task:

<br>"Between now and the next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens in your family that you ant to continue to have happen."


<br>Do more of what works.
<br>Do something different. 

<br>The suggestion to do something different can be given as an experiment. 


<br>Go slow.

<br>This suggestion, taken from the MRI model, is designed to help clients overcome fear of change by asking about possible negative consequences of changing and warning against trying to change too rapidly. 


<br>Do the opposite. 

<br>This suggestion is based on the notion that many problems are maintained by attempted solutions. Suggesting that clients try the opposite of what they have been doing is especially useful for problems that exist between just two people. 


<br>The prediction task.

<br>"Before you go to bed tonight, predict whether the problem will be better or the same tomorrow. Tomorrow night rate the day, and compare it with your prediction. Think about what may have accounted for the right or wrong prediction. Repeat this every night until we meet again."








<br>The solution-focused approach is drawing attention to the family's resources and encouraging them to capitalize on their strengths in order to focus on solutions rather than problems. 
<br><br>
<br>Later sessions are devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress. When a family returns for a subsequent session, the solution-focused therapist endeavors to create a cooperative mind-set and then inquires about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the client's role in attaining it. 
<br>Then the therapist assists the clients in looking forward to how they will plan their next steps toward solution:

<br>"What's better?" or "What happened that you liked?"
<br>"Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that."
<br>"Wow! That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?"
<br>"And what else is better? What do you think the next step might be? On a scale of 1 to 10, you say your progress is now at a 5. What would a 6 look like?"
<br>If there was no discernable progress, coping questions may be asked:

<br>"How did you keep things from getting worse?"
<br>"What's your idea about what might be helpful?"
<br>"What do you think the next step should be?"




<br><br>
<br>Suggestions:

<br>Notice some positive about the child: their colorful sneakers, team cap, etc. 
<br>Use relationship questions such as 'What would your mother tell me is your best subject in school?'
<br>Avoid 'why' questions. Try asking 'how come?'; It is less intimidating. 
<br>Responding to 'I do not know"; Acknowledge that it was a hard question, then say, "Suppose you did know; what would you say?" or "What would your best friend say?"


<br><br>

<br>Families with suicidal members
<br>Domestic violence
<br>Sexual abuse
<br>Alcoholism
<br>Families with children with severe intellectual disabilities, and schizophrenia. 


<br>Some have proposed models that incorporate solution-focused techniques (e.g., <a data-href="Scaling Questions" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/scaling-questions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Scaling Questions</a>, <a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a>) into other forms of family therapy, most commonly structural family therapy, in the treatment of adolescent substance use, adoption, and low-conflict divorce. 
<br>The solution-focused model has also been applied outside of traditional therapeutic practice to include interventions in family medicine clinics, social service agencies, nursing care, educational settings and model schools, and business systems.
<br>The two most powerful ingredients in solution-focused therapy are:

<br>Building on what works
<br>Helping people identify what they want rather than what they don't want


<br>People who come for help often think of the times when their problems don't occur as unimportant because these occasions seem accidental or inconsistent. Calling attention to past successes and latent abilities helps clients rediscover their own best coping strategies. 
<br>The great thing about the imagination is that with very limited encouragement, people can see themselves as succeeding rather than fumbling and failing. 

<br>In the solution-focused therapist, clients have a coach and guide to help them work toward this brighter future. 


<br>Like any approach in the early stages of evolution, solution-focused therapy was sometimes presented in a cookbook style, leading some to imagine that treatment can be reduced to a set of formulaic techniques. 

<br>The unique features of solution-focused therapy are deceptively easy to describe, but like all therapies, it takes great skill to implement effectively. 


<br>A second major criticism of solution-focused therapy is that its insistence on solution talk may cut off clients from empathy and understanding. 
<br>The issue of whether solution-focused therapy is genuinely collaborative has been raised frequently. 

<br>This approach has even been called 'solution-forced therapy' by some because of the perceived tendency for therapists to pressure clients into discussing only positives. 


<br>Solution-focused therapists have stressed the importance of the therapeutic relationship. 

<br>"The speed and success of solution construction depend on the therapist's ability to stay connected with the clients' reality throughout the course of therapy. This is the underpinning for the whole collaborative process, the grease that keeps the axles turning."
<br>The solution-focused approach won't likely be effective if therapists, in a rush to get to their own agenda, fail to listen to clients and make them feel understood. 


<br>It is unfortunate that more research has not been done to test the effectiveness of solution-focused therapy. Most of the research has been conducted by solution-focused practitioners themselves. 

<br>It has been concluded that while methodological weaknesses existed in most cases using solution-focused therapy, the studies do provide tentative support for the use of solution-focused brief therapy in the treatment of a child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. 

<br>It was also concluded that solution-focused therapy may hold more promise as a mode of early intervention when the presenting problem is not as severe. 




<br><br>
<br>One aims to help clients do less of what doesn’t work; the other promotes more of what does. Both of these pragmatic approaches focus on the presenting complaint and aim to resolve it as quickly as possible. The MRI model does so by looking for failed solutions to eliminate; the solution-focused approach searches for forgotten solutions to rediscover.

<br>whereas the MRI approach focuses on behavior, the solution-focused model emphasizes cognition as well as behavior. MRI therapists urge clients to do things differently; solution-focused therapists urge them to view things differently.


<br>Problems are seen as persisting in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. The idea is that people often get stuck in their problems because by trying to get to the bottom of them, they overlook solutions that are right under their noses.
<br>the development of a set of techniques for changing problem talk into solution talk.

<br>These techniques include:
<br>Exception questions (“Can you think of a time when you didn’t have the problem? What were you doing then?”)
<br>The miracle question (“Suppose you went to sleep and a miracle happened such that when you awoke, your problem was solved. What would be different?”)
<br>Scaling questions (“On a scale from 1 to 10, how do you feel now compared to when you called?”)
<br>Coping questions (“Given how bad that was, how were you able to cope?”)
<br>The formula first-session task (“After you leave today, observe what happens that you want to continue during the next week.”)
<br>Compliments (“Wow, you must be very smart to have thought of that!”). 
<br>These techniques are put into practice as soon as possible to keep the work brief and to discourage clients from dwelling on the negative side of their experience.


<br>This has led to a call for greater collaboration with clients so that their feelings are acknowledged and validated before solution-focused techniques are introduced.
<br>Some of its popularity can be attributed to therapists’ struggle to find ways to feel effective while living with managed care’s limited number of sessions. In addition, the techniques of this therapy are relatively easy to learn (the basics can be picked up in a few workshops), and its upbeat nature makes it more enjoyable for many therapists.

<br>Yet its easy-to-learn formula leads some therapists to dismiss it as superficial. Critics question whether therapists are really having a respectful conversation with clients when they only coax optimism.

<br><br>
<br>The narrative approach is a perfect expression of the postmodern revolution. 

<br>It's approach is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave.

<br>Personal experience is fundamentally ambiguous.

<br>Understanding human experience, including our own, is never simply a matter of observing it. The elements of experience are understood only through a process that organizes those elements, puts them together, assigns meaning, and prioritizes them. 


<br>Strategic therapists give clients reframes, or new interpretations, for their experience. Narrative therapists believe that such interpretations won't take unless they fit people's stories. 


<br>Unlike the cybernetic metaphor, which focused on self-defeating patterns of behavior, the narrative metaphor focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. With the cybernetic metaphor, therapy meant blocking maladaptive interactions. The narrative metaphor, on the other hand, focuses on expanding clients' thinking to allow them to consider alternative ways of looking at themselves and their problems.

- The art of analyzing literary texts or human experience, understood as fundamentally ambiguous, by interpreting levels of meaning.<br>
- The truth of experience is not discovered; it's created. The goal of therapy shifted from historical truth to narrative intelligibility. The challenge was to construct truths in the service of self-coherence, not to resurrect a true picture of the past.<br>
- Stories don't just mirror life; they shape it. 

<br>Narrative therapists believe that problems arise when people are indoctrinated into narrow and self-defeating views of themselves. 

<br>To counter the way society convinces people they are their problems, narrative therapists externalize problem. Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are encouraged to think of themselves as struggling against their problem; the problem is the problem.

<br>


<br>Narrative therapists have little to say about family dynamics because they reject the idea that families are responsible for the problems of family members. 


<br>


<br>Narrative therapists not only avoid judgements about what is normal but also reject the very idea of categorizing people. 
<br>Too often in human history, the judgements made by people in power regarding normality and abnormality have been used to subjugate those with no voice in the matter. 

<br>Family therapists may have trouble seeing their own concepts - such as rigid boundaries, cross-generational coalitions, and enmeshment. 

<br>Narrative therapists strive to help clients make sense of their own experience. 




<br>Narrative therapists endeavor to situate themselves with clients; that is, to disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. Clients are also encourages to educate therapists regarding their cultural predicaments and to correct them when they make assumptions that don't fit the clients' experience. 
<br>The basic assumptions narrative therapists make about normal families:

<br>People...

<br>Have good intentions (they don't need or want problems)
<br>Are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them.
<br>Are not their problems. 
<br>Can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the culture myths they have internalized. 






<br>


<br>Narrative therapists concentrate on the way individuals narrate their exchange. It's their stories that affect not only what they notice but also how they interpret it. 
<br>Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. 

<br>Such closed and rigid narratives make people vulnerable to being overtaken by destructive emotional states that narrative therapists portray as alien invaders. 

<br>They do believe that such emotional responses are external in the sense that they are socially constructed. Externalizing problems cuts down on guilt and blame. 






<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapists do not strive for clinical neutrality. They are active advocates who take sides with their clients and encourage them to see themselves as courageous warriors against the forces that try to trap them in pessimistic mind-sets.
<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapists help people separate themselves from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions) to open space for new and more constructive views of themselves. Narrative therapy transforms identities from flawed to preferred, not by getting family members to confront their conflicts but by separating individuals from problems and then uniting the family to fight a common enemy. This is facilitated by combing the family's history for unique outcomes, or times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. 
<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapists help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones.

<br>Reweaving narrative accounts into more palatable and coherent histories. 
<br>Involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience.

<br>Narrative therapists use externalizing conversations to help separate persons from problems. This is one way to deconstruct disempowering assumptions. 

<br>Once a problem has been externalized and redefined in more experience-near terms, an individual can begin to resist it. By viewing the problem as an external entity, narrative therapists free families to challenge its influence on their lives.  

<br>They also endeavor to shift family members' perceptions of one another from totalizing views, which reduce them to one set of frustrating responses.

<br>In externalizing conversations, therapists ask effects questions such as, "How does the problem affect you? Your attitudes?" Through this process, the problem's field of influence is broadened so that clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. It is in these areas that clients can notice unique outcomes - experiences that would not be predicted by a telling of the problem story, times when they resisted the problem's influence.
<br>As long as both sides remain fixed in polarized perspectives, they may be too busy to think about their own preferences. In unhappy families, people are often so busy not being what others expect that they have no time to figure out what they want for themselves.

 <br><br><br>
<br>People constantly construct knowledge, and we function in a perpetual state of assessing the information that is presented to us. Interpreting the perceptions of what we see and what we hear allows us to reach conclusion about the world around us. 
<br><br>
<br>The investigator's interpretation of information and evidence commonly requires answers to many questions that can lead critical of decisions, action, and outcomes, such as:

<br>What must be done to protect the life and safety of persons?
<br>Should force, up to and including deadly force, be used to resolve a situation?
<br>Who will become the focus or subject of a criminal investigation?
<br>What is the best plan to apprehend the person or persons responsible for a criminal act?
<br>Will someone be subjected to a search of their person or of their home?
<br>Will someone be subjected to detention or arrest and questioning for a criminal act?
<br>Will someone have a criminal charge sworn against them?
<br>Will someone be subjected to a criminal trial?
<br>Will someone's liberty as a free person be at-risk?
<br>Will justice be served?
<br>Will the community be protected?


<br>The investigator must always be ready to explain their thinking and actions to the court. 

<br>Thinking must illustrate an evidence-based path to forming reasonable ground for beliefs and subsequent action. 
<br>Thinking must demonstrate consideration of the statutory law and case law relevant to the matter being investigated. 


<br>Investigation is the collection and analysis of evidence.

<br><br>Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood that begins around the onset of puberty and ends with relative independence from the parent. This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.<br><br>

<br>According to the model, self-control results from a balance between a 'cool' and a 'hot' system. 

<br>The cool system is an emotionally neutral, strategic, and flexible cognitive system. 
<br>The hot system is emotionally driven by fears, desires, and reflexes. 


<br>The balance between these two system varies as a function of the individual, development, and stress. 


<br>The dual-system model was used to heuristically explain brain systems underlying behavior involving immediate versus delayed rewards.

<br><br>This qualitative interview study investigated the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages received by Multiracial American youth over the course of their development. The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18 (Saulny, 2011), but there is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. Multiracial youth are members of multiple racial-ethnic groups. Thus, racial-ethnic socialization is particularly complex for Multiracial families because parents typically have different racial backgrounds and experiences compared to their children. Interviews were conducted with 20 Multiracial emerging adult college students (Mage = 20.55; 10 male, 10 female) of diverse racial backgrounds to identify the types of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages they received growing up. Using thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), nine themes of racial-ethnic socialization content emerged: Cultural socialization, racial identity socialization, preparation for bias socialization, colorblind socialization, race-conscious socialization, diversity appreciation socialization, negative socialization, exposure to diversity socialization, and silent socialization. This research advances the literature by (a) identifying domains of racial-ethnic socialization messages for Multiracial American families, (b) examining a diverse sample of male and female Multiracial youth, (c) differentiating monoracial versus Multiracial socialization messages, and (d) distinguishing the unique connotations of egalitarian socialization messages (e.g., colorblind, raceconscious, diversity appreciation). The ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the development of Multiracial American individuals and families.<br><br>

<br>It was not until 1967 that interracial marriages became legal across the US with the Loving v. Virginia case. 
<br>The Multiracial population in America is the largest demographic group among individuals under the age of 18. 
<br>There is a dearth of research about the development of this rapidly growing population. 

<br>There is a lack of research that examines how Multiracial American families navifate racial issues and prepare their children for living in a society dominated by monocentrism, which assumes every individual is associated with only one racial group and pathologizes and excludes those who do not fit this norm. 
<br>More research is needed that examines racial-ethnic socialization or the transmission of messages from caregivers to children about the meaning of their racial-ethnic group membership, in Multiracial families.

<br>Socialization from caregivers plays an important role in reducing the negative effects of racial inequities by helping children of color understand race, develop a strong sense of identity, and build resilience to racial conflict.

<br>Theorizes how race-related factors work together to inform development.
<br>This model posits that the messages that caregivers give about their child's racial-ethnic heritage and culture might shape how the Multiracial child understands their racial-ethnic identity and prepare them for responding to racial discrimination. 

<br>Little is know about how this process of racial-ethnic socialization plays out in Multiracial families. 
<br>Parents may not know how to provide useful messages or may even convey discriminatory messages to their child. 


<br>The model posits that social climate affects Multiracial youths' experiences of racial-ethnic socialization and identity development.




<br><br>
<br>Previous qualitative studies examining racial-ethnic socialization in Multiracial families have found that monoracial parents typically do not talk explicitly about race and ethnicity with children, utilizing colorblind messages that deemphasize the significance of structural racism instead. 
<br>One recent study with transracially adopted Korean American adults raising Multiracial children found that parents did engage in socialization promoting monoracial identities (i.e., Asian American or White), but did not specifically promote Multiracial identity.
<br>MultiCrit highlights that on top of racism and colorism, Multiracial youth experience monoracism, or discrimination based on one's Multiracial status.

<br>Multiracial youth report being exoticized, tokenized, objectified, placed into monoracial boxes, rejected, and forced to pick a monoracial identity to appease monoracial peers. 


<br>Seven domains of racial-ethnic socialization experienced by Multiracial American youth:

<br>Cultural Socialization

<br>Encompasses messages about cultural traditions and values and exposure to people, foods, and other aspects associated with one's racial-ethnic heritage. 


<br>Racial Identity Socialization

<br>Involves messages about how the child belongs to and should be proud of their membership in various racial-ethnic groups, as well as labels they can use to racially identify themselves.


<br>Preparation for Bias Messages

<br>Teaches children about racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination they may face based on their race and create space for dialog about experiences of racism within the family. 


<br>Egalitarian Socialization

<br>Prioritizes messages about everyone being the same


<br>Negative Socialization

<br>Encompasses implicitly or explicitly conveyed prejudicial


<br>Exposure to Diversity Messages

<br>Exposure to diversity through schools and communities was another way parents influenced their children's racial-ethnic socialization. 


<br>No Racial-Ethnic Socialization

<br>Some parents were silent on the topic of race or actively avoided or ignored the topic. 




<br><br>
<br>
Nine themes representing the content of racial-ethnic socialization messages emerged from the analysis of the interviews

<br>Racial Identity Socialization
<br>Preparation for Bias Socialization
<br>Colorblind Socialization
<br>Diversity Appreciation Socialization
<br>Race-Conscious Socialization
<br>Exposure to Diversity Socialization
<br>Negative Socialization
<br>Silent Socialization


<br><br>
<br>Involves exposure to the customs and traditions of youths' heritage cultures. 
<br>Participants reported learning about and experiencing many different cultural aspects from their parents including language, food, clothing, traditional dance, media, and holidays, which helped them feel more connected to their cultures. 
<br>Participants also learned about their culture through stories about their family history and the history of the parent's origin country, visiting their parent's country of origin, and participating in cultural events such as local festivals or community parties with family friends from a specific ethnic background. 
<br>Food was the most prominent connection Multiracial youth had to their culture.

<br>Food was a cultural aspect that crossed over from one parent to the other, in that moms would learn from their mother-in-law how to cook dishes specific to their husband's culture. 
<br>Food was an important way that family celebrated their multiple cultures.


<br>Language Socialization

<br>There were parents who knew their partners, making it another aspect of shared family culture for Multiracial families. 


<br><br>
<br>Racial identity socialization involved messages from parents to Multiracial youth explaining their racial-ethnic background(s) and sometimes also telling them which labels they could or should use to identify with their racial background. 
<br>Some racial identity socialization messages acknowledged the Multiracial nature of youths' identities, while others encouraged identification with only one racial-ethnic group.
<br><br>
<br>Certain messages from parents emphasized the monoracial aspects of youths' identity. 
<br>In certain situations, parents also encouraged youth to identify with the racial background that would be most advantageous to them in achieving a goal. 
<br>Youth were taught to focus on only one of their heritages if it would help them in applying to jobs or schools. 
<br><br>
<br>There were also messages from parents that highlighted youths' multiple heritages or Multiracial identity. 

<br>Participants reported that their parents taught them that they were members of all of their groups, though the term 'Multiracial' was rarely ever mentioned.

<br>"You are both things, you are biracial... Definitely identify as such."




<br>Even second-generation Multiracial youth were reminded to acknowledge all of their backgrounds. 
<br><br>
<br>Preparation for bias socialization involved both making Multiracial youth aware of racial biases that others might have due to their racial-ethnic heritage and teaching them how to respond to or cope with experiences of others racially discriminating against them.

<br>Preparation for bias also occurred through parents sharing the experiences they had with discrimination played. Moreover, youth learned from their parents by witnessing them experiencing discrimination and seeing how they responded. 


<br><br>
<br>Messages that prepared youth for bias in ways that were applicable to discrimination targeted at both their monoracial and Multiracial groups were labelled General Preparation for Bias Messages.
<br>One way parents suggested that Multiracial youth handle racial bias was by ignoring people who discriminated against them and letting things go.

<br><br>The biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence stimulate young people to think about themselves, reﬂect on the kind of people they want to become, and ﬁnd their place in society. Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson’s theory and Marcia’s identity status model, but process-oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents ﬁnd a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well-being.<br><br>

<br><br>Teaching and talking about race and ethnicity with children and adults is especially important in racially diverse societies. This process has been coined racial/ethnic socialization (RES). Despite the importance of RES, we still know very little about how this process unfolds in the lives of White youth. Thus, from a social, cognitive, and developmental perspective, the authors summarize ﬁndings from empirical research and theory on RES for White youth across stages of development—early childhood through young adulthood. Since RES is linked with cross-group attitudes (e.g., less bias, prejudice, stereotyping) and behaviors (e.g., inclusion), we highlight future directions for research and discuss applications for existing ﬁndings for an increasingly diverse society.<br><br>

<br><br>Cultural-­ecological theories posit that ethnic-r­ acial identity (ERI) development is shaped by transactions between contexts of ethnic-­racial socialization, yet research considering intersections among multiple contexts is limited. In this study, Black, Latino, White, and Asian American adolescents (N = 98; Mage = 16.26, SD = 1.09; 55.1% female identifying) participated in surveys and focus group discussions (2013–­2014) to share insights into ERI development in context. Using consensual qualitative research, results indicated: (a) family ethnic-­racial socialization intersects with community-­based, peer, media, and school socialization; (b) ethnic-­ racial socialization occurs outside family through intersections between peer, school, community-­based, and media settings; and (c) ethnic-r­ acial socialization is embedded within systems of racial oppression across contexts. Discussion includes implications for future research and interventions supporting youth ERI.<br><br>

<br><br>Abstract<br>
In the current decade, the U.S. population reached historically high levels of ethnic–racial diversity and reelected the nation's first Black–White biracial President. Simultaneously, scholars also documented significant ethnic–racial inequities in education, increased xenophobia, and a racial climate that revealed deep‐seated ethnic–racial tensions. Given this backdrop and acknowledging the significant role that families play in youths' abilities to navigate their social contexts, the current review focused on the literature on families' ethnic–racial socialization efforts with youth from the 2010 decade. Our review of 259 empirical articles revealed that there has been an exponential increase in research on family ethnic–racial socialization in this decade. Furthermore, although it is clear that family ethnic–racial socialization is a robust predictor of youths' adjustment, the associations between socialization and adjustment must be considered with attention to specific socialization strategies, the confluence of strategies used, and the unique contexts within which families' lives are embedded.<br><br>

<br>The capacity to maintain one's own identity (thoughts, values, and beliefs) while remaining emotionally connected to others. 
<br><a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> introduced this concept to explain how individuals manage anxiety and stress by separating thinking from emotional reactivity. 
<br><br>
<br>Refers to the intensity and immediacy of emotional responses. Highly reactive individuals may be overwhelmed by stress, clouding rational thinking. 
<br>Example.

<br>An individual who becomes instantly upset over minor criticism, indicating difficulty in self-regulating. 


<br><br>
<br>A strategy to manage anxiety by distancing oneself from emotionally charged relationships. 
<br>Example.

<br>An adult who avoids family reunions to escape unresolved conflicts. Although cutoff can reduce immediate distress, it prevents long-term resolution and growth. 


<br><br>
<br>Describe overly close, undifferentiated relationships where boundaries are blurred. 
<br>Example. 

<br>A person who mirrors a parent's moods and opinions to the point of losing their own identity. 


<br><br>
<br>The ability to assert one's own beliefs and maintain a distinct sense of self even under pressure from family members. 
<br>Clinical implication

<br>Strengthening the I-position is a key therapeutic goal, helping clients balance intimacy with independence. 


<br>Lower differentiation is associated with chronic anxiety, dependency, and interpersonal difficulties. Studies on dyadic adjustment (e.g., Lampisa's work) show that higher differentiation correlates with more satisfying intimate relationships. 
<br><br>
<br>A triangle is formed when a two-person (dyadic) relationship becomes unstable due to anxiety, prompting the includsion of a third party to diffuse tension. 
<br>Triangles are considered the smallest stable emotional unit in a family. They serve to distribute and manage anxiety but can also perpetuate problematic dynamics.

<br>Developmental Systems Perspective

<br>Adolescent development is best understood as a dynamic interplay between the individual and their changing context. 


<br>Long-term impact of adolescence

<br>While acknowledging the influence of early childhood experiences, both sources highlight the unique and lasting impact of adolescent experiences on adult outcomes. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Authors criticize traditional theories that separate individual and context, arguing that they fail to capture the relational nature of development. 
<br>Developmental Systems Model

<br>This model considers the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of organization, from biological to cultural. 
<br>This model emphasizes

<br>Change and Relative Plasticity

<br>Individuals and contexts are constantly changing, and this plasticity allows for potential interventions to promote positive development


<br>Relationism and Integration

<br>Variables from different levels of organization are interconnected and influence each other. 


<br>Historical Embeddedness and Temporality

<br>Development is embedded within historical time, leading to both continuity and discontinuity within and between individuals. 


<br>Limits of Generalizability, Diversity, and Individual Differences

<br>The dynamic nature of development limits generalizability and highlights the importance of considering individual and contextual diversity. 






<br>Implications for Research and Application

<br>This model calls for multilevel, longitudinal research to understand individual-context relations and design intervention that alter those relations in positive directions.


<br><br><br>
<br>'Shot Out of a Cannon' models emphasize early childhood experiences determining life trajectory. 
<br>'Contact Sport' models acknowledge the continuous interaction between individual and context throughout life. 
<br><br>
<br>Research shows that interventions targeting early childhood influence long-term outcomes by impacting specific adolescent factors like substance use onset, teen births, and educational attainment. 
<br><br>
<br>The authors advocate for longitudinal studies explicitly designed to test the unique contribution of adolescence to long-term outcomes. 
<br><br>
<br>The authors hypothesize that childhood and adolescence likely have both cumulative and domain-specific effects on adult outcomes. 
<br><br>
<br>Both sources agree that adolescence is a critical developmental period with lasting impacts on adult outcomes. They advocate for a developmental systems approach that recognizes the dynamic interplay between individual and context throughout the lifespan. 
<br>Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies explicitly designed to pinpoint the specific characteristics and experiences during adolescence that contribute most significantly to diverse long-term outcomes. 
<br>This knowledge will inform effective policies and interventions to maximize the positive potential of adolescence for individuals and society as a whole.

Family Influences]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>I. Overview<br>This document summarizes findings from five research articles focusing on various aspects of adolescent development, with an emphasis on the role of family dynamics, cultural factors, and individual experiences in shaping adolescent well-being. The themes covered include:<br>
<br>The impact of adolescent secrecy and disclosure on adjustment.
<br>Parental strategies for gaining knowledge about their adolescents' lives and the influence of these strategies on adolescent outcomes.
<br>The interplay of cultural and general stressors on Latinx adolescents' mental health and the protective role of familismo.
<br>The importance of family acceptance for the mental and physical health of LGBT adolescents.
<br>II. Key Themes and Findings<br>A. Secrecy vs. Disclosure in Adolescent-Parent Relationships (Frijns et al., 2010)<br>
<br>Core Argument: The traditional measure of adolescent disclosure to parents conflates two distinct constructs: disclosure (what adolescents freely share) and secrecy (what adolescents actively conceal). Secrecy has a stronger impact on adolescent adjustment than previously recognized.
<br>Key Findings:Factor analysis confirmed that disclosure and secrecy are separate constructs.
<br>"Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
<br>Secrecy and delinquency were reciprocally related over time.
<br>Increased secrecy is linked to "stress-related psychological problems, prevent full processing of the secret information, and cause mental rumination and obsessive preoccupation with the secret."
<br>Implications: Researchers should distinguish between disclosure and secrecy when studying adolescent-parent relationships. Interventions should address the underlying reasons for adolescent secrecy.
<br>B. Parental Knowledge and Strategies (Liu et al., 2020)<br>
<br>Core Argument: Parental knowledge of adolescent activities is influenced by both parent-driven strategies (e.g., solicitation, control, warmth) and child-driven strategies (e.g., disclosure).
<br>Key Findings:Children's disclosure is the strongest predictor of parental knowledge compared to parental solicitation, behavioral control, and psychological control. The meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between children's disclosure and parental knowledge (ρ = 0.523, p &lt; 0.001).
<br>Psychological control is negatively associated with parental knowledge.
<br>Parental warmth and behavioral control indirectly contribute to parental knowledge by promoting children's disclosure. "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
<br>Cultural differences exist: The association between behavioral control and parental knowledge was stronger in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.
<br>Implications: Parents should focus on fostering warm, supportive relationships with their children to encourage open communication and voluntary disclosure.
<br>C. Stress and Familismo in Latinx Adolescents (Montoro &amp; Ceballo, 2021)<br>
<br>Core Argument: Both cultural and general stressors impact Latinx adolescents' psychological well-being, but familismo (a strong emphasis on family unity, support, and obligation) can serve as a protective factor.
<br>Key Findings:Family-based cultural stressors were associated with increased depressive symptoms whereas familismo was associated with fewer depressive symptoms
<br>Greater material need was associated with increased depressive symptoms and a less positive future orientation.
<br>"Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
<br>Racial discrimination is positively associated with anxiety
<br>Implications: Interventions should leverage the strength of familismo to help Latinx adolescents cope with stress and promote positive mental health outcomes.
<br>D. Family Acceptance and LGBT Adolescent Health (Ryan et al., 2010)<br>
<br>Core Argument: Family acceptance is a critical protective factor for LGBT adolescents, significantly impacting their mental and physical health in young adulthood.
<br>Key Findings:"Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
<br>LGBT adolescents with low family acceptance were more than three times as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to those with high family acceptance.
<br>Latino, immigrant, religious, and low-socioeconomic status families appear to be less accepting, on average, of LGBT adolescents
<br>Implications: Promote interventions that educate and support families in accepting their LGBT children to reduce health disparities and improve well-being.
<br>III. Quotes<br>
<br>Frijns et al. (2010): "Only secrecy was a longitudinal predictor of adolescent internalizing (i.e., depression)..."
<br>Liu et al. (2020): "Parental warmth seems to provide the basis for high-quality children's disclosure."
<br>Montoro &amp; Ceballo (2021): "Familismo protected adolescents from depressive symptoms linked to material hardship."
<br>Ryan et al. (2010): "Family acceptance predicts greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status; it also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors."
<br>IV. Overall Implications<br>These studies collectively highlight the crucial role of family relationships in adolescent development. They emphasize the importance of open communication, parental warmth and support, cultural understanding, and acceptance in promoting adolescent well-being. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on strengthening family bonds, addressing both cultural and economic stressors, and promoting positive family dynamics to support healthy adolescent development.]]></description><link>https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/current/adolescent-and-emerging-adulthood/7.-family-influences.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Adolescent and Emerging Adulthood/7.

<br><br>In this week's spotlight for attractions, we have Ohio History Connection (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" target="_blank">https://www.ohiohistory.org/Links to an external site.</a>)!&nbsp;The Ohio History Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society, is a statewide history organization with the mission to spark discovery of Ohio’s stories. As a nonprofit organization chartered in 1885, the Ohio History Connection carries out history services for Ohio and its citizens focused on preserving and sharing the state’s history. This includes housing the State Historic Preservation Office, the official state archives and the Community Engagement Department and managing more than 50 sites and museums across Ohio. I participated in their event on site. They hosted a bunch of reenactors there to reenact the 1950s! That event should also be happening again around the beginning of the year, so I hope to see you there! This museum is really cool to walk through, and they are always hosting events.&nbsp;<br>For our restaurant, this week I chose Mozart's (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://mozartscafe.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://mozartscafe.com/" target="_blank">https://mozartscafe.com/Links to an external site.</a>)! Mozart's has been a Clintonville destination for over 20 years. Mozart’s brings Europe to Columbus through breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an incredible variety of decadent European pastries. This "taste of Austria" is accompanied by live piano music and jazz on select nights. Make sure you also check out the beautifully restored building, which was built in the 1920s.<br>Columbus lore... Columbus was first laid out in 1812 and incorporated in 1816. Columbus was not the original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after short periods in both Chillicothe and Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access to transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life.<br>During the twentieth century, Columbus continued to grow and prosper. Due to lighted arches that spanned over the city's major north-south thoroughfare, High Street, Columbus earned the reputation of being the most "brilliantly illuminated city in the country." Most of these arches disappeared by mid century, but in 2002, the city began to construct new ones to celebrate Columbus' past.&nbsp;<br>If you would like to add any suggestions, please feel free to comment below!<br>I hope this weather clears up and we get some sunny fall days. The leaves are falling! Where does the time go.&nbsp;<br>Have a wonderful week, and please reach out to myself or Anna, our TA, if you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp;<br>Warmest regards,<br>Lynn Reidinger<br><br>Another week, another (late) announcement,<br>I hope you are having a great week, we are halfway through, whether that's the semester or the week you decide! This week we will begin to look at the basic patterns of sexual orientation and behavior. We also look at the critiques on sexual attitudes, sex education, and the sexual double standard. By the end of this module, you will be able to answer some questions such as...<br>
<br>What is sexual orientation? How have attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the medical and scientific communities?
<br>According to researchers, what is the role of genetics, evolution, and social environment in determining sexual orientation?
<br>REMINDER: Please put aside enough time to watch 'How to Lose Your Virginity' (1 hour and 6 minutes) and 'Sex 101' (20 min).&nbsp;<br>In this week's restaurant, I chose Belle's Bread.&nbsp;Tucked away in the Japanese marketplace located on Kenny Centre Mall,&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bellesbread.japanmarketplace.com/" target="_blank">Belle’s BreadLinks to an external site.</a>&nbsp;is a family-owned and -operated, French-inspired Japanese bakery. Takashi Takenaka opened the business after immigrating from Japan in 1972, and he pays homage to childhood treats with his red bean roll, frank roll, and curry and boiled egg doughnuts. The bear-shaped strawberry cream bun is all over social media, but the best-kept secret is the Mont Blanc roll with its layers of delicate, airy sweet cream and chestnuts.&nbsp;<br>In Columbus Lore this week, our amazing student Doug Motz wrote this piece on the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="Link" href="https://columbusunderground.com/history-lesson-aiu-the-leveque-tower-pt-2-dm1/" target="_blank">AIU &amp; The LeVeque TowerLinks to an external site.</a>. I learned so much information from this article, and it is just one piece of history from our city. Please take a moment to read through this article, if you get the chance. You know that big building that has those beautiful lights displayed at the top? Yup, that's this place! It has gone through it's fair share of history, and many owners. Apparently, the floodlights that were installed in 1989 had theatrical gel placed by hand to add the color to the tower. Though, this was updated in 2017 with LEDs that allow for color changes with ease. No more applying that gel by one very brave man. Thank you, Doug!! Just a wonderful piece of history to share with you all.&nbsp;<br>Go outside and play in the leaves, take a moment to breathe. You have done so well, and I am so proud of you! Keep working hard as you always have, and remember to take care of yourself this week. :)<br>Warmest regards,<br>Lynn Reidinger<br><br>Goooooooood Evening Buckeyes!<br>

<br>On this week's Columbus lore, I thought I would bring it a little closer to home and look into OSU's history. You know that beautiful building you most likely walk by regularly called University Hall? Well, do I have some interesting facts for you.<br>This was the first classroom building opened in 1873!&nbsp;<br>

On the first day of classes in September 1873, the students entered an unfinished University Hall. This first building on campus was a classroom building, library, administrative office building, and it had apartments for faculty and dormitory rooms for male students. (The students moved out when the first dormitory opened in 1874). It even housed the Geology Museum until Orton Hall opened in 1893. University Hall had a chapel as well, which was originally used for a daily religious service.<br>In the spring of 1968 concern about the building's structural integrity led to a study of its safety. It was determined to be unsafe, and on May 9, 1968, the Board of Trustees instructed the administrative officials of the University to move everything out of the building. University Hall was torn down in September 1971. Today’s University Hall occupies almost exactly the same spot as the original University Hall (it is slightly east). When the original University Hall was torn down, there was quite a bit of discussion over which architectural style the new building should have. Eventually, University officials decided to make the new University Hall look the same as the original building on the outside. Although less ornamental, and smaller, today’s University Hall is still a landmark on campus. It was completed in 1976.

I chose Emmett's Cafe! This bakery/cafe is located in the Old North.&nbsp;Inspired by Australian coffee culture, Emmett’s is the top pick for morning hangouts with a flat white or cold brew. This laid-back spot recently opened a second, much larger and brighter location at the Open Air building, a renovated school building in Old North. Open until 2pm during the work week, the cafe offers wifi and plenty of space to spread out with a few coworkers. Food options go far beyond pastries, with options like overnight oats, filling breakfast sandwiches, grain bowls, wraps, and even a wagyu burger.&nbsp;<br>A random attraction, one that is certainly not everyone's taste, but I thought I would share nonetheless, Wagner-Hagans Auto Museum! This auto museum is a private collection here in Columbus that is free and open to the public. This is a small museum without regular staff, so you do need to call and schedule an appointment to tour the museum.<br>I am certainly not one to be personal, but I thought it was only appropriate to share. I got married this weekend! My husband and I decided to elope and read our vows in Hocking Hills. It was only appropriate we read our vows near Ash Cave, since that is the new last name I am taking. If you see me signing Millie Ash, that is my new name! You are more than welcome to call me Lynn or Millie. I will include a picture of Ted and me at the trailhead!<br>I hope the cool weather is a welcomed relief to the blistering heat we had over the last several weeks. Get that pumpkin spice latte for yourself, you deserve that treat! I can't wait to see the leaves falling all over campus.&nbsp;<br>Warmest regards,<br>Millie Lynn Ash (Lynn Reidinger)<br><br>Hey Class,<br>I apologize for missing our weekly announcement last week, but I was unfortunately not feeling well. We can't skip this week, what if some of you are waiting on this week's Columbus lore? As always, I will have interesting history, activities, and suggested restaurants below.<br>You worked through your midterm, WOO! I am so proud of each of you for getting to this point in the semester. I can't believe we are almost finished. It has been a pleasure getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to each of you that congratulated me on my marriage, and this week seems very fitting!<br>This week we look at marriage and cohabitation. Be mindful as we reflect on diversity, inequality, and social change in terms of marriage. We will consider how marital quality changes across the life course and illustrate the hallmarks of poor marital communication. Do you know what are the predictors of a high quality, satisfying marriage? What specific relationships come to mind when you think of a healthy marriage?<br>This week's assignments are outlined below. As always, we accept your assignments 24-hours late with a 2-point deduction on your essays and discussions, and a 1-point deduction for your weekly reflections. We are unable to accept your InQuizitive quizzes late.&nbsp;<br>Please read:<br>

Originally, there was no formal plan for an Oval. The space in front of University Hall was intended to be a large rectangle, in the tradition of an English manor.<br>By 1900, however, the Oval began to form as buildings cropped up around the open space. In 1905 there were no sidewalks and students joked of people disappearing into the mud. The mud paths were studied and eventually their locations influenced where sidewalks were placed.<br>The Oval also contains several memorials. The most well-known is perhaps “The Five Brothers,” which is composed of five elm trees planted as a class gift. The originals were planted in 1891 and succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease, the last in 1971; the replacements were planted in 1987. Other memorials include the flagpole in front of Bricker Hall, dedicated in 1917 to graduates killed in WWI, and a sundial, a gift from the class of 1905, which now stands in Sphinx Plaza.<br>The Oval has been home to commencements, rallies, student demonstrations, cavalry drills, contests, and even a musical chairs contest for charity.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.anthony-thomas.com/" target="_blank">Anthony Thomas Candy Company.</a>!<br><img alt="Announcements-7.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/announcements-7.png"><br>
Anthony&nbsp;Zanetos&nbsp;immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1907. His first job was as an apprentice candy maker in a local candy shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was in 1916, when Anthony experienced the urge to go into business for himself. This decision molded the lives of four generations. In 1932, Anthony opened the Co-op Dairy at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Broad Street in Franklinton. It was Anthony’s dream for a father and son business. In 1945 Anthony’s son Tom, returned home from service following W.W.II. Together they started Anthony’s Confectionary where the Co-op Dairy used to be. Following the war, sugar was rationed and Veterans that were in the candy business could get a 30,000-pound annual allotment of sugar, which made Tom a valuable asset and an instant partner with his father. Realizing&nbsp;the quality of the candy was creating a demand, Tom and his father decided to make it a full time trade, and using their first names they formed the Anthony-Thomas Candy Company in 1952.<br>Astounding Activities: The Scioto Deer&nbsp;<br>“Announcements-8.png” could not be found.<br>You may have probably seen at least one of the three bronze deer sculptures located throughout Columbus, but do you know why they’re actually there? It’s okay, neither did I. These friendly, relaxed-looking deer were added to the Scioto Mile as part of the big rehabilitation project in 2014 that&nbsp;turned the area into the incredible multi-use park and trail space it is now.There are a total of three deer along the Scioto River admiring the river, and they were put in during the renovation. Two of these funky art pieces are behind COSI and the other is on the Rich Street Bridge watching over our beloved city. So don’t worry everyone, the deer are protecting us.&nbsp;<br>I hope you all have a great week. I should be on tomorrow for our office hours if you may need anything (My office hours are Tuesdays from 1p-2p). Please take some time this week to soak in some sun and enjoy this fall weather. You have worked so hard to get to this point!<br>Warmest regards,<br>Millie Lynn Ash<br><br>IT'S HALLOWEEN!!!<br>This is my favorite holiday, and it makes me so happy to see people dressed up while walking around campus. Make sure to grab some candy for yourself (... getting it on sale tomorrow does in fact count), and take it easy this week. This week's topic some of you may already have some experience with, whether directly or indirectly, parenting. We will analyze societal expectations and attitudes around parenthood and childlessness. We will also look at concepts of intensive motherhood, helicopter parenting, and co-parenting.&nbsp;<br>REMINDERS:<br>InQuizitive (Chapter 9): 11/1<br>Discussion (Intensive Parenting): 11/3<br>Essay 9: 11/5<br>Reflection 9: 11/5<br>On this week's Columbus lore, we are back on campus with my personal favorite:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.thelantern.com/2018/11/the-history-behind-mirror-lake/" target="_blank">Mirror Lake</a><br>

It is very fitting to choose this wonderful place as our topic for Columbus Lore. The first contact with the lake was not with a person, as its history might suggest, but a horiculture wagon! Students rolled the wagon into the lake as a Halloween prank in 1895. The lake has a history of dunking freshman and tug-of-war across the lake. The Lantern depicted a freshman in the middle of the lake, dubbed the 'Freshman Bathtub.' In the 1920s, the tradition of dunking freshmen into the lake had been given approval from the student council and the university president. The rules: Freshmen must wear a specific cap at all times and not step food on the Long Walk, the brick path across the Oval leading up to Thompson library. Only assigned enforcers of the Bucket and Dipper club were allowed to toss freshmen into the lake. The last the lake would see of any tug-of-war across the lake was around the 1950s. It was stated the 3 minutes it took for one side to take over the other felt like 3 hours for people in attendance! In 1964, an engaged couple 'quarreled' at the lake; the man took back the engagement ring and threw it in the lake, and the woman went searching for it in a bikini. She was initially arrested but the executive dean finally allowed her to resume the search in different attire. She found the ring!<br>“Announcements-9.png” could not be found.<br>Riveting Restaurants:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://thurnsmeats.com/about_us.html" target="_blank">Thurn's Specialty Meats</a><br>On easter weekend in 1886, Alois 'Grospop' Thurn opened up a stall at the old Central Market and began selling old world style, processed items. He immigrated to Columbus from Germany a few years before and had begun working at a processing plant. He used the scraps to make meals for his family, and then his neighbors. In 1958, with the new interstate encroaching, his son, Alois, along with his grandsons, Robert, Paul and Leo, began construction on a new plant and storeroom. &nbsp;This facility is still in use today. &nbsp;In 1965, the Thurn brothers moved out the Central Market, 2 years before its demise. &nbsp;Since that time, 530 Greenlawn Avenue is the only place to buy Thurn’s products.<br>Astounding Activities:&nbsp;<br>“Announcements-10.png” could not be found.<br>For those of you who have not heard, Columbus has a very special field of corn.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.visitdublinohio.com/listing/field-of-corn-(with-osage-oranges)/451/" target="_blank">The Field of Corn</a>&nbsp;is an art installation that playfully reshapes the landscape. Rows of towering concrete corn cobs invite contemplation on themes of agriculture, transformation, and artistic expression. Unearth the artist’s vision behind this unique creation and its role in Columbus’s cultural tapestry.<br>There was the first frost, and I definitely felt slow getting to class this morning. Mr. Ted has been coming to campus with me, so if you ever see us walking by don't be afraid to say hi!<br>Have a fantastic week!<br>Warmest regards,<br>Millie Lynn Ash<br><br>Hi Buckeyes!<br>Though we are not covering anything this week, I wanted to send an announcement out to all of you regarding the event that will take place for each of you tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a time to gather with our families, eat some nice hearty food, and take a wondrous carb nap afterwards! For some, you may not celebrate or do anything at all.&nbsp;<br>My home is open to each and every one of you if you do not have anyone to celebrate the holidays with. You have become a part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family over this semester, even if I still have yet to actually meet you in person. As we have learned, family is a broad spectrum that includes a variety of circumstances, contexts, and people. Our family includes those we love, those we don't, those who would answer their phone in the middle of the night, those we turn to in times of need, those we learn from, and so many more. Whatever role your family plays in your life, please know you will be forever in mine. I will always be here to support you on your journey to wherever you are going.&nbsp;<br>To change tune a bit, do you really know the origins of Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving is known for its yummy food and terrible traffic, but did you know the first European Thanksgiving in the United States was celebrated in 1564? This tradition, though centuries old, was not the first. The credit for that event goes to Native Americans.<br>From contemporaneous records, we know that the Pilgrims and Native Americans had turkey and other game birds, as well as sea foods, venison, Indian corn, beans, berries, and nuts. They drank mostly beer, wine, and whiskies - all safer than the local water.&nbsp;<br>Thanksgiving as a holiday originates from the Native American philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return. In the first celebration of this holiday, the Wampanoag tribe provided not only the food for the feast but also the teachings of agriculture and hunting (corn, beans, wild rice, and turkey are some specific examples of foods introduced by Native Americans).<br>Though you may have known about the information above, did you know that the fourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving) is recognized as the National Day of Mourning for Native Americans and their families.&nbsp; For many Native Americans, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.&nbsp;<br>While some Native Americans have chosen to reject the Thanksgiving holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture. In this way, Thanksgiving is simply a chance to appreciate the good things in life, like family, community, and the riches of the land. Long before settlers arrived, Native tribes celebrated the autumn harvest and the gift of Mother Earth's abundance. Native American spirituality, traditionally and today, emphasizes gratitude for creation, care for the environment, and recognition of the human need for communion with nature and others.&nbsp;<br>Now, regardless of the day's ambiguous origin, many Native Americans will gather with friends and family and use the day to eat good food (many of the classic Thanksgiving dishes are inspired by indigenous foods) and give thanks.&nbsp;<br>I hope you learned something from above, and remember to actually rest over break. I know how easy it is to just work through it, as I probably will. Do as I say, not as I do! Take care of yourselves, and drive safe. Tonight is the heaviest drinking night of the year, and I passed many accidents on my way today. Your life and safety matter more than those extra couple minutes you save.&nbsp;<br>Whether you celebrate or don't, be kind, grateful, and gentle with yourself and others this break. Don't add to the population, don't subtract from the population, and don't get sent to prison. I can't becoming an auntie just yet!<br>We are almost finished, I can't believe how quickly the time has flown by. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know each and every one of you over the last several months. Remember, you always have a home with me.&nbsp;<br>Warmest regards,<br>Millie Lynn Ash<br>Happy Tuesday everyone!<br>Though this announcement will be reaching you a day later than usual, I still wanted to check in on everyone. This week's content is critical to consider in our current political sphere. We will analyze social issues that have impacted inequality and social change with regard to family life among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Americans from the Middle East. I want you to examine your own racial/ethnic identity and privilege and how it manifests in family life. We discuss examples of implicit bias and microaggressions and how they impact the individual and family.&nbsp;<br>We will be reading Chapter 3 in Cohen (2020) this week, which is posted under the top module labelled '<a title="Textbook Information" class="internal-link" data-href="/courses/180658/modules/1814602" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/courses/180658/modules/1814602" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Textbook Information</a>.' You will also be taking a look at a few videos on racism and microaggressions.&nbsp;<br>Things to keep in mind for this week:<br>

<br>The change in the dependent (outcome) variable for a one unit change in the independent (predictor) variable, while holding all other variables constant.
<br>Expressed in the original units of the dependent (outcome) and independent (predictor) variables.
<br><br>
<br>The values obtained after standardizing all variables (both dependent and independent variables) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
<br>This allows for the newly calculated variables to represent the change in the dependent variable (in standard deviations) for one-standard deviation change in the value of the independent variable.
<br><br><br>
<br>Measures the relationship between two variables without controlling for any other variable(s) using simple correlation.
<br>We would use this when we want to understand the simple bivariate relationship between two variables.
<br>We would likely use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient R for this type of analysis.
<br><br>
<br>Measures the correlation between x and y while controlling for x2 (on both x and y).
<br>We would likely use this when we want to understand the direct relationship between two variables, independent of influence of other variables.
<br><br>
<br>Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of one or more variables on only one of the two variables.
<br>Correlation between x and y while controlling for x2 (on x1 only)
<br>We would likely use this when we want to understand the exact contribution of an independent (predictor) variable to the dependent (outcome) variable, after taking into account the influence of other variables on the independent (predictor) variable.
<br><br><br>
<br>All predictors are added into the regression model at the same time.
<br>The model evaluates the contribution of each predictor to the outcome variable while controlling for all other predictors.
<br>R-squared is a static value that represents the variance explained in the outcome variable by the collective set of predictors.
<br><a data-href="Continuous variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous variable</a> is added as it is

<br>Variables with non-zero values should be ‘centered’
<br><br>
<br>Predictors are entered into the model in a pre-specified order based theory-driven blocks.
<br>The model is built in blocks (steps) with each block adding one or more predictors. The change in the model’s R-squared is assessed at every step.

<br>A series of multiple-regression are performed, with each block being added to the next until all variables are included in the model.
<br>The final block of hierarchical multiple regression = simultaneous multiple regression.


<br>Very useful to look at the change in R-squared for each variable or blocks of variables

<br>Allow for testing hypotheses in the order of importance/priority of predictors.


<br>Squared semi-partial correlation provides the unique variance explained by a given variable.
<br><br>
<br>Predictors are added/removed from the model based on statistical criteria such as p-values or R-squared change rather than being theory-driven. Predictors are added/removed in data-driven blocks.
<br>Mathematically derives the highest R-squared value with the least number of predictors.
<br>CAUTION: NEVER USE THIS METHOD UNLESS STUDY IS ABSOLUTELY EXPLORATORY.
<br><br>
<br>Most predictive variables are added first
<br><br>
<br>Least predictive variables are removed first
<br><br><br>
<br>When you square the semi-partial correlation, it yields the proportion of the variance of y uniquely explained by x while controlling for all other predictors.
<br><br><br>
<br>Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear
<br>Move dependent variable to Dependent. Move independent variable(s) to the Independent(s).<br>
- In Statistics, select Estimates (under Regression Coefficients), Model Fit, Descriptives, and Durbin-Watson (under Residuals, independence of errors). Click Continue.<br>
- In Plots, select Histograms and Normal Probability Plot (under Standardized Residual Plots). Move ZPRED under Y. Move ZRESID to X. Click Continue.<br>
- In Save, select Cook’s (under Distances). Click Continue.<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.
<br><br>
<br>The relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (outcome) variables is linear.
<br>How to Check
<br>
<br>Use Scatterplots to visualize relationships. Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot.
<br>Click Simple Scatter. Click Define.
<br>Move your dependent variable (outcome) to the Y-Axis. Move your independent variable (predictor) to the X-Axis.
<br>If the scatterplot is approximately linear, the assumption is met.

<br>If not linear, apply transformation.


<br><br>
<br>Observations are independent of each other (no autocorrelation, where observations are NOT independent)
<br>How to Check
<br>
<br>Use the Durbin-Watson test by clicking the option under Linear Regression: Statistics.
<br>If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 – 2.5, the assumption is met.

<br>If data is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Autocorrelation" data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">autocorrelated</a>, use alternative models such as the generalized least squares (GLS) model. 


<br><br>
<br>The residuals (errors) have constant variance across all levels of independent variable(s).
<br>How to Check
<br>
<br>Plot residuals vs. predicted values and look for a random scatter.
<br>In SPSS, request Linear Regression Plots. Move Y &gt; ZPRED. Move X &gt; ZRESID.

<br>If the scatterplots shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met.
<br>If assumption is violated, you can transform the dependent variable, use standard errors, or apply weighted least squares (WLS).


<br><br>
<br>The residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
<br>How to Check (For None or One Grouping Variable)
<br>
<br>Click Analyze &gt; Descriptives &gt; Explore
<br>Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box.
<br>Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected.
<br>Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. Click Continue.
<br>Click OK.
<br>Check Shapiro-Wilk Test of Normality, Normal P-P Plot, Histogram, and Skewness/Kurtosis.

<br>If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal.

<br>If it is below .05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.


<br>If the points are generally along the diagonal of the Normal P-P Plot, the assumption is met.
<br>If the Histogram is approximately normal (distribution curve is bell-shaped), the assumption is met.
<br>If Skewness and Kurtosis are between +2 and -2, the assumption is met.


<br><br><br>
<br>How far a case is from some point of reference
<br><br>
<br>Identifies the distance of cases from the mean (s) of predictor (s). Extreme cases in multivariate space are found via a cut-off point (critical value of <a data-href="Chi-Square Test" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/chi-square-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chi-Square Test</a>)
<br><br>
<br>Measure the distance between an observed value and its predicted value that have all been converted to z-scores.
<br>Typically flag cases if they are 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean.
<br><br>
<br>How far a point deviates from the mean of that variable.
<br>Gauges the influence of the observed values over the predicted values.

<br>Ranges from zero to (N – 1) / N
<br>Average value is (k + 1) / N
<br>No greater than 2 (k + 1) / N or 3 (k + 1) / N


<br><br>
<br>The degree to which a variable can ‘pull’ the regression towards itself.

<br>Measures the overall influence of a case on the model
<br>Typically flagged if value is over 1


<br><br>
<br>Factor loadings help determine which variable is associated with which latent factor. For example, several likert-scale questions on a questionnaire observing psychological outcomes may load highly on a ‘depressive/depression’ factor, showing they measure the same underlying construct. Higher values of factor loadings (e.g., &gt; .4 or .5) indicate that a variable is a strong indicator of that factor. Lower values suggest the variable is less relevant to that factor. EFA can allow us to group variables with higher factor loadings on the same factor, reducing the complexity of our data.

<br>3
<br>The eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by each factor. If using the eigenvalue cutoff of 1, the cutoff is greater than 1 because the retained factors explain more variance. This can be seen on the Scree plot where there is a point where the slope of the curve changes, which is usually the cutoff for the number of factors we would retain. Factors to the left of the cutoff are considered meaningful. This is why there are only 3 out of the original 12 factors that were extracted from the analysis. The first three factors account for more of the variance in the model.

<br>A moderator is a variable that affects the strength or direction of the relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y).
<br>A mediator is a variable that explains the mechanisms or process through which an independent variable (x) affects a dependent variable (y).
<br><br><br><br>
<br>The purpose of the ‘seed’ option in a line of PROCESS syntax is to lock the random number generator. This ensures that the findings remain consistent across multiple runs of the analysis. Without specifying a ‘seed’ value, the random number generator would draw different values each time, leading to slightly different results.
<br><br>
<br>When a covariable absorbs variable from both the predictor and the error term, it can lead to:
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Sphericity is an assumption in repeated measures ANOVA that states the variance of the differences between all pairs of within-subject conditions (levels of the independent variable) should be equal. This means that if we have three time points (A, B, C), then the variance of (A – B) ≈ variance of (A – C) ≈ variance of (B – C).
<br>Sphericity is a special case of homogeneity of variance assumption and is specific to repeated measures designs.
<br>Potential Consequences of Violating Sphericity

<br>Inflated <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> Rate (False Positives)

<br>Standard F-tests assume sphericity, so violating it increases the risk of finding a significant effect when none actually exists.
<br>The p-values become too small, leading to incorrect conclusions.


<br>Reduced Statistical Power (False Negative)

<br>If sphericity is violated and not corrected, the test might be too conservative, making it harder to detect real effects (Type II Error: Failing to detect a true effect).


<br>Distorted F-ratios

<br>The denominator degrees of freedom in the F-test get inflated which makes the ANOVA test statistics biased. This impacts the accuracy of hypothesis testing.

<br>R comes with some functions which are free to use (e.g., mean (), sd ())
<br>You do not need to install any package before using those functions
<br>However, to access a function written by others (other than the original 'authors' of R), you first have to install it as a 'package.'
<br>These packages often come with dataset(s), functions, examples, etc.
<br>Install a package using 'install.Packages ('name of the package)')'
<br>You need to install the package once and it will be on your computer permanently. 
<br><br>
<br>After installing a package, you need to load it before having access to its functions, datasets, etc.
<br>Use 'library(name of package)' to load a package.

<br>There are many functions to explore your data

<br>View to have a quick view of your data
<br>Head to print out the first 6 rows
<br>Tail to print out the last 6 rows
<br>Summary to look at the summary of all your variables
<br>Psych::describe to check the descriptive statistics
<br>Use the dollar sign ($) to help select a specific variable

<br>E.g., mean(kids_score $age) will compute the mean for the variable age in the 'kids_score' dataset


<br>mean() to find the mean of a variable
<br>sd() to find the standard deviation
<br>var() to find variance

<br><br>
<br>Do we have an IQ of zero?
<br>Sometime, interpreting the intercept becomes difficult or meaningless, especially when we are dealing with variables like IQ, SAT scores, etc.
<br>We have to use what is termed as 'mean-centering'

<br>That is creating a new variable by simply subtracting the mean from each individual observation
<br>E.g., Centered IQi = IQi - IQ-bar (mean of IQ scores)


<br><br>
<br>** Centering mom_iq.
<br>** Note that the mean for mom's IQ is 100
<br>COMPUTE iq_c = mom_iq - 100
<br>** Running a simple linear regression using the centered variable

<br>The scatterplot shows an inverse relationship between Mahal Distance and the associated p-values. So, if the p-value of the maximum Mahal distance (Check the 'Residual Statistics Table') is greater than the threshold of .001, you can conclude that there is no significant outlier on the predictor(s).
<br>You do not even have to check the Mahal distance for individual cases.
<br><br>
<br>The absolute values of DfFITS (i.e., |SDF_1|) tells us the magnitude of the effect an individual case have on the predicted values. 
<br>This indicates that, the SDF_1, similar to the Cook's distance, help examine the influence of some cases on the predicted values. 
<br>Cases with absolute values of DfFITS greater than 2 (i.e., |SDF_1| &gt; 2) should be examined.

<br>Since the maximum absolute value is .33205, which is not greater than 2, we can conclude that there is no issue with an influential outlier(s).
<br><br>
<br>Helps examine whether a case is influential on the intercept or the slopes. 
<br>The case should first be considered influential by looking at the D and/or the DfFITS. 
<br>A case with an DfBeta greater than 2 can be said to have greater influence on the regression parameter in question (Pituch &amp; Stevens, 2016). 
<br>This case then has to be investigated.<br>
<img alt="4. Diagnostics and Psychometrics-12.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics-12.png">
<br>In our example<br>
- SDB0_1 represents the DFBETA for the intercept<br>
- SDB 1_1 represents the DFBETA for the mom's IQ<br>
- SDB 2_1 represents the DFBETA for the mom age<br>
<img alt="4. Diagnostics and Psychometrics-13.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/4.-diagnostics-and-psychometrics-13.png">
<br>The maximum absolute DFBETA (i.e., |DFBETA|) value for all the regression parameters (i.e., the intercept and the slopes) are less than 2, hence we can conclude that none of the cases have relatively high influence on our regression parameters.

<br>Controlling for the other predictors in a model, does x predict y?

<br>The above is logical only if the relation between x and y does not depend on another predictor in the model. 
<br>If a relation does depend on a moderating variable (w), then moderation has occurred and the relations need to be explored. 


<br>Moderation can occur between categorical predictors, categorical and one <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> predictor, or between <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">continuous</a> predictors.

<br>This next significant table shows us the conditional effects of W at the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentiles. 
<br>Here, we see that when puppy love is at the 16 th percentile (puppy love = 1), the effect is 1.81 (p = .0013). Likewise, when puppy love is at the 50 th percentile (2.5), the effect is also significant (p = .0046) at 1.1694. 
<br>However, the effect is no longer significant at the 84 th percentile for puppy love, (p &gt; .05).<br>

<br><br>
<br>The next table is the Johnson-Newman results. 
<br>The Johnson-Newman approach looks for the values of W, where the p-values of the conditional effect changes to above/below the chosen significance level (. 05). So, it looks for the values of W that cause t-crit value to equal zero for when determining the conditional effect of X, where the p-value is exactly the alpha, or .05 in most cases. 
<br>At what values of W, do the results go from significant to non-significant, or vice-versa, in terms of conditional effect?
<br>Your results can either be of one, two, or zero values. 

<br>If there is one value, that means there is only one value of W where the conditional effect either becomes significant or loses significance. 
<br>If there are two values, that means there are two points at which W will change in significance. This will either mean the middle range is significant, but not the high and low values of W, or that the high and low values of W are significant, but not the middle range. The middle range is determined by the W values themselves. 
<br>If there are no values, then the conditional effect is either always significant or never significant for all values of W.


<br><br>
<br>Next are graphical representations for what different types of Johnson-Newman results may look like. 
<br>Where the line cross .05, that's where this approach looks for the value of W, giving us more insight into what extent our moderator... Well, moderates.<br>

<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-19.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/5.-conditional-process-analysis-19.png">
<br>See that the Johnson-Newman technique gave us only one value, 3.3364. 
<br>By finding the value in the table below, we can see that the conditional effect is significant before W = 3.3364, but non-significant after that point. So, it is significant with lower levels of puppy love. (First column, row 3.3364)<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-20.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/5.-conditional-process-analysis-20.png">
<br><br>
<br>The moderator (puplove) has significant impact on the relationship between time spent with Puppies and Happiness, only at its low values (i.e., from 0.00 to 3.3364)

<br>This implies that, the less an individual loves a puppy, the more time spent with puppy affect (increases) their happiness. 


<br>At its higher values, the moderator (puplove) does not have a significant effect on the relationship between time spent with Puppies (focal predictor) and Happiness (outcome variable)

<br>This implies that, increasing the time spent with Puppy does not affect/change (increases) happiness for individuals who already love Puppies. 


<br><br>
<br>The next part of the table give us the syntax to generate the plot<br>

<br>Double click on the matrix table and it will allow you to highlight and copy parts of the text. 
<br>Highlight and copy from the DATA LIST FREE/ until the period at the end. 
<br><br>
<br>Once you copy the code, paste it into a new syntax file. 

<br>There is nothing you need to change. Just highlight and play the syntax. 


<br>The results will look like the graph below, a plot with points but no lines.<br>

<br>Click on the Add lines at Subgroups button (It looks like a scatterplots with TWO lines through it, not one) (circled in red)
<br>You will get the properties pop-up now, but by default, it will give you the lines you need, as you can see now in the red boxed area. 
<br>Just close the properties box and the chart editor box.<br>

<br>This is what your chart should look like now. You can now have lines that can help you to visualize the changes in X vs. Y, given the subgroups of W.
<br><br><br>
<br>Pretend that literature shows that the more someone loves puppies, the happier they are. We would like to test that theory, but with a moderator of time spent with puppies during a trial (dose).
<br>Here, we are recognizing that Dose is a multi-categorical variable for control group (0 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes with puppies).
<br>Typically, we would need to dummy-code these variables, but PROCESS does it for you, provided you remember one extra step. 
<br><br>
<br>First, set up the model as usual in PROCESS. 

<br>Note. Where the variables are in the image based on the new hypothesis. 


<br>Next click on 'Multicategorical'<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-25.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/5.-conditional-process-analysis-25.png">
<br>The next pop-up you will get is the multicategorical box. 
<br>Here, you will select the checkbox under 'Variable W' to indicate that your moderator is multicategorical. 

<br>Note. The other options, indicating that you can also do this for any X or Z variables(s) that have 3 or more categories. 


<br>Click Continue.<br>

<br><br>
<br>One of the changes is the dummy coding. The coding scheme is provided just below the model overview and will look something like the table below.<br>
<img alt="5. Conditional Process Analysis-27.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/5.-conditional-process-analysis-27.png">
<br>The next change is the model and product terms key tables. Just keep in mind the W coding scheme from before when interpreting each line, since now we are recognizing the separate levels of our W.
<br>The final change is the set-up of the conditional effects table. 
<br>Usually, this will either be representative of the 16 th, 50 th, and 84 th percentile (default), or the means +/- 1 SD (if selected). However, now since we are recognizing W as a categorical variable, the doses are listed as the separate categories.<br>
- Note how there is no mention of the percentiles in the 'Analysis Notes and Errors' section.<br>

<br>By including a covariate, we can reduce error variability and account for confounds. 
<br>It indicates differences in means are 'adjusted' for differences on the covariate.

<br>Example

<br>A study on how to build a laptop
<br>Suppose we have an experiment with 3 instructional groups and one covariate

<br>Instruction from a YouTube video
<br>No instruction at all

<br>By adding a covariate, differences in pre-test are 'removed' (controlled for) from the error term and means are adjusted to the predicted post-test level if all cases had the same skill level going into the study.

<br>The relationship between the covariate and the outcome variable should be the same across groups. 
<br>A simple scatterplot (with a regression line) showing the relationship between the covariate and the outcome variable can help verify this assumption. 


<br>You can run the ANCOVA model by including an interaction term (groups x covariate). 

<br>The interaction term should not be statistically significant. 
<br>If it is statistically significant, then it means the slopes are different across groups, hence the violation of this assumption.

<br>So, if you are looking at a, b, and a x b

<br>The first value is for a
<br>The value for b is after controlling for a
<br>a x b's value is after controlling for a and b.


<br>Best for specific theory where order matters

<br>I.e., partial out certain variables first. 


<br><br>
<br>a accounts for b and vice versa. 
<br>This is best when you don't have an interaction effect. 
<br><br>
<br>Every value accounts for every other effect (main or interaction)
<br><br>
<br>If order matters, Type I. 
<br>If order does not matter, and there is no interaction, Type II. 
<br>If order does not matter, but there is an interaction, Type III.

<br>Repeated measures designs are an extension of the dependent group (paired samples) t-test.
<br>Paired samples t-tests are used to compare means between paired, dependent, or matched groups. Collection of data on the same persons over time means responses are related to each other, across time. They are <a data-href="Dependent Observations" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Dependent Observations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Observations</a>

<br>Differences from pre to post (e.g., time 1 to time 2)
<br>Often the same respondents, repeatedly measured (not always, but not our focus)


<br>In comparison, independent-groups designs look at:

<br>Differences in means across groups (often manipulated in experimental designs)
<br>Mean differences across existing groups

<br>Gender, school level, generation status (e.g., quasi-experimental designs)




<br><br>
<br>With repeated measures designs, the structure of the data becomes relevant. 
<br>Data types

<br>Long

<br>Respondents have multiple rows of data corresponding to multiple measurement occasions


<br>Wide

<br>Respondents have one row of data
<br>Multiple variables are used to represent multiple measurement occasions




<br>GLM for repeated measures (aka repeated measures ANOVA/MANOVA)
<br><br>
<br>Combination of both between-and within-subjects factors are referred to as 'mixed designs'
<br><br>
<br>Different people are assigned to different levels of the factor
<br>Each case (person) is exposed/included to only one condition or level
<br><br>
<br>The same person tests all conditions (i.e., is exposed to all levels of the factor)
<br>Repeated-measures designs are 'within-subjects' designs, where each subject forms a 'group' or factor
<br><br>
<br>Repeated measures ANOVA

<br>SST = SS (Explained) + SS (unexplained)


<br>We are trying to explain differences in teh repeated measures due to time (or whatever the within factor is)
<br>We are removing/controlling variability due specifically to subjects. 
<br>We need to characterize unexplained/residual variability carefully for repeated measures designs (i.e., through the subject x time interaction)
<br>One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA

<br>One-Way Repeated measures ANOVA with A treatments/times and B persons includes three 'sum of squares' terms.

<br>Relatedly, homogeneity of covariance is equal variances and covariacnes across time. 
<br>Sphericity is a tough assumption to meet, as we don't expect correlations between times 1, 3, and 5 to be necessarily the same. 
<br>Mauchly's sphericity test in SPSS tests this assumption. 

<br>We do NOT want this to be statistically significant.


<br><br>
<br>The distribution of the data will not be in line with an F-distribution
<br>Loss of statistical power
<br>Post-hoc tests become uninterpretable
<br>If violated, what should we do?

<br>Use a more conservative f-test. SPSS gives you three options increasing in conservatism
<br>Consider using MANOVA
<br>Consider using multilevel modeling


<br><br>
<br>Based on estimates of sphericity (Epsilon; ε)

<br>Ranges from 0 - 1 with higher scores meaning greater homogeneity


<br>Huynh-Feldt Correction (least conservative) ε &gt; .75
<br>Greenhouse-Geisser (more conservative) ε &lt; .75
<br>Lower-bound (most conservative) ε &lt;. 75
<br>If the results change depending on which correction used, it's a safer bet to use Greenhouse-Geisser regardless of Epsilon value (e.g., the cutoff somehow made a difference) or report both and acknowledge the difference. 
<br><br>
<br>Instead of time as treatment effect (univariate), MANOVA treats time as separate <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> s (multivariate)
<br>Repeated measures analyses automatically include both, but if sphericity is violated, it might be better to just use MANOVA. 
<br>Repeated Measures ANOVA

<br>Univariate DV
<br>More rigid assumptions of sphericity
<br>When sphericity holds, use RM ANOVA
<br>You can look at contrasts and other post-hoc tests


<br>MANOVA

<br>Multivariate DVs
<br>Less rigid assumptions of sphericity
<br>A large violation of sphericity (ε &lt; .70) and sample sizes of 10 people larger than the number of groups (j + 1), use MANOVA. 
<br>The power of MANOVA varies as a function of the correlation between the DVs. 


<br><br>
<br>Multilevel modeling approach (aka <a data-href="Hierarchical Linear Models" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/models/hierarchical-linear-models.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchical Linear Models</a>; General Linear Mixed-Effects Models)

<br>Time is nested within each subject
<br>Very flexible

<br>Allows for random effects and variability in measurement occasion. 


<br><br><br>
<br>If the overall F for differences among treatments is statistically significant, further analysis is needed to evaluate where the significant differences are. 
<br>The SPSS procedure contrasts that can be used to evaluate differences. 
<br>If the repeated measure has k levels, a set of contrasts include (k - 1) comparisons
<br>Options

<br>Polynomial contrasts (the default in SPSS, but rarely used in social sciences)
<br>Repeated contrasts
<br>Simple contrasts


<br><br>
<br>For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. 
<br>For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. 

<br>Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3


<br>This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them. 

<br>Very similar to dummy coding in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a>, where we only know differences between the reference category and all other categories (not each other)


<br><br>
<br>Compare the mean of each level (except the last) with the mean of the subsequent level

<br>Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 2 &gt; Time 3


<br>Useful if the responses are in a meaningful order (like time)
<br>Equivalence (or justifiable inequivalence) of measurement is crucial
<br><br>
<br>Makes more sense when the levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to different amounts of treatment (rather than different types)
<br>If there are k levels for the repeated-measures factor, then (k - 1) polynomials will be tested.

<br>SPSS makes it easy to restructure your data, albeit if certain parameters are in place first

<br>There must be an ID variable for every participant
<br>There must be an index variable that indicates timepoint for data
<br>There must NOT be duplication of a case within a timepoint
<br>Preferable if all cases have equal timepoints of data (makes things easier to see and is required by most analyses, though not necessarily for data restructure)


<br>Data &gt; Restructure &gt; Restructure Data Wizard!
<br>Ignore the words SPSS uses (they are hard to understand) and instead look at the pictures. Wide to stacked is first, and stacked to wide is second. Ignore the third one (trust me).

<br>You need to tell SPSS how many variables you want to create. So, if the global satisfaction scale has seven items that we want combined across time, we need to say seven variables.

<br>Select your ID variable and put it as the case group identification. You could also 'use case number' and have the ID variable be a fixed variable, but I find that more troublesome. You then have to include all items to be stacked in separate blocks based on what the variable will be. You must do this for every variable to be stacked. The dataset has 129 such variables, so you can see that this will take a long time. Most of the time, stacked data comes stacked so you don't need to do this.

<br>Each subject responds to all J levels of the factor
<br>Each of the n subjects has J scores do N = n x J
<br>Unequal cells can only happen when subjects miss the administration of one or more levels of factor A


<br>A researcher tested whether 1-hour, biweekly yoga classes increased the fitness level of eight undergraduate studnets over a 4-month period (4 levels of within-subjects factors). Students were measured at the end of each month using a 10-point fitness measure (10 being most fit).

<br>This assumes that the variance of the difference scores for each pair of factor levels is the same


<br><br>
<br>Example: 20 children were tested at 3 rd grade, 5 th grade, and 8 th grade. The test scores were compared over time. Thus, we have 3 levels in the within-subjects factor (Time). For each pair of levels, we can obtain a st of difference scores. The sphericity assumption states that these three sets of difference scores have equal variance.
<br><br>
<br>If the variance of the difference scores are statistically equal then the sphericity assumption has been met. 
<br>The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA
<br>The violation of sphericity is serious for the repeated measures ANOVA. 
<br>The violation causes the 'Usual' F-test to become too liberal (i.e., an increase in the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate). Therefore, determining whether sphericity has been violated is very important. 
<br>Luckily, if violations of sphericity do occur, corrections have been developed to produce a more valid critical F-value (i.e., reduce the increase in <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate)
<br><br>
<br>Like in Levene's HOV test, the null hypothesis is the variances of difference scores are equal.
<br>Test NOT Significant (p &gt; .05) &gt; Assumption MET! Variances are the same. 
<br>Test Significant (p &lt; .05) &gt; Assumption NOT met! Variances are different. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Measure: Score - Tests the null hypothesis that the error covariance matrix of the orthonormalized transformed dependent variables is proportional to an identity matrix: a Design: Intercept. Within Subjects Design: CAP. 
<br>Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicates that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, , χ2 (2) = 7.916, p = .019.

<br>For a study that features a control group and one or more comparison groups, the usual question is whether each of the comparison groups has a mean that differs significantly from the control group mean. 
<br>For repeated measures, the control group is Time 1 (baseline). So, comparisons are made based on differences between Time 1 and all other time points. 

<br>Time 1 &gt; Time 2, Time 1 &gt; Time 3


<br>This set of contrasts does not provide information about all possible comparisons, as the baseline must be included in all of them.

<br>Mediation examines how the effect of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) is transmitted through a third variable, called the mediator (M). In simple mediation, there is one mediator.
<br><br>
<br>To determine if the IV influences the DV directly and/or indirectly via the mediator. The model splits the total effect into
<br><br>
<br>The portion of the effect of IV on DV that is not explained by the mediator.
<br><br>
<br>The portion of the effect that is transmitted from IV to DV through the mediator.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Relationships among IV, mediator, and DV are linear.
<br><br>
<br>Scatterplots:

<br>Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot and plot DV vs. IV and DV vs. M.

<br>Look for a straight-line pattern.


<br>Residuals vs. Predicted Plot:

<br>Run Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear…; click Plots… to assign standardized predicted values (X-axis) and standardized residuals (Y-axis).
<br>Criteria: No systematic pattern (i.e., randomness, with any curve test yielding p &gt; .05).




<br><br>
<br>Residuals have constant variance across all levels of predictors.
<br><br>
<br>Examine the same residuals vs. predicted plot for an even spread (no funnel shape).
<br><br>
<br>Residuals are approximately normally distributed.
<br><br>
<br>Create histograms and Q–Q plots using Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram or Q–Q plot options.

<br>Criteria: Skewness values less than |2.0| and kurtosis values less than |7.0|; Q–Q plot points should lie near the diagonal line.


<br><br>
<br>Observations are independent.
<br><br>
<br>Confirm via your study design.
<br>Review the Durbin–Watson statistic from your regression output (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable).
<br><br>
<br>There are no unmeasured variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and DV.
<br><br>
<br>This is primarily a design issue; however, consider including control variables if needed.
<br><br><br>
<br>Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX by Andrew Hayes
<br>Choose Model 4 (designed for simple mediation).
<br>Set the DV, IV, and mediator in the appropriate boxes.
<br>Enable bootstrapping (commonly set to 5,000 samples) to obtain robust confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effect.
<br>Click OK.
<br><br>
<br>Direct Path (IV → M):  

<br>Example: a = 0.40, SE = 0.10, p = .001


<br>Path from Mediator to DV (M → DV, controlling for IV):  

<br>Example: b = 0.50, SE = 0.12, p = .002


<br>Indirect Effect (a × b):  

<br>Example: 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.200.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20

<br>Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.08, 0.35] (does not include zero → significant mediation).




<br>Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for M):<br>
Example: c′ = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005
<br>Total Effect (IV → DV without mediator):<br>
Example: c = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001
<br><br>
<br>A mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to examine whether [Mediator] mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The total effect of [IV] on [DV] was significant (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p &lt; .001). When [Mediator] was entered into the model, the direct effect decreased (b = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .005). The indirect effect was significant (b = 0.20, SE = 0.07, 95% CI [0.08, 0.35]), indicating that [Mediator] partially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV].
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Parallel mediation involves multiple mediators that operate simultaneously. Each mediator is theorized to transmit the effect of the IV on the DV independently.
<br><br>
<br>To examine whether different processes (mediators) independently contribute to the effect of the IV on the DV. This model allows you to assess which mediator(s) play a significant role and to what extent.
<br><br>
<br>IV → Mediator 1 → DV  
<br>IV → Mediator 2 → DV  
<br>(Mediators do not influence one another)
<br><br><br>
<br>Generate scatterplots for DV vs. each mediator.
<br>Run separate regression analyses for each mediator (DV as outcome, mediator as predictor) and inspect residuals vs. predicted plots.

<br>Criteria: Residuals should show no systematic pattern.


<br><br>
<br>Create histograms and Q–Q plots for the residuals of each regression.

<br>Criteria: Skewness &lt; |2.0| and kurtosis &lt; |7.0|.


<br><br>
<br>Run a correlation matrix (Analyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate) among the mediators.

<br>Criteria: Inter-mediator correlations should be moderate (ideally, r &lt; 0.80) to avoid redundancy.


<br><br>
<br>As with simple mediation, verify study design and check the Durbin–Watson statistic (1.5–2.5).
<br><br>
<br>Navigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
<br>Use Model 4; PROCESS allows entering multiple mediators simultaneously.
<br>Enter the IV, DV, and list all mediators.

<br>Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals for each indirect effect.


<br>Click OK.
<br><br><br>
<br>Example: a1 = 0.30, b1 = 0.40 → Indirect effect = 0.30 × 0.40 = 0.12

<br>Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.03, 0.22] (significant if CI does not include zero, p = .012).


<br><br>
<br>Example: a2 = 0.25, b2 = 0.35 → Indirect effect = 0.25 × 0.35 = 0.0875

<br>Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.18] (significant, p = .025).


<br><br>
<br>Sum of individual indirect effects (if both are significant).
<br><br>
<br>Example: c′ = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001
<br><br>
<br>A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to evaluate whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] independently mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The indirect effect through [Mediator 1] was significant (b = 0.12, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.22], p = .012), as was the indirect effect through [Mediator 2] (b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], p = .025). The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that both mediators contributed uniquely to the overall relationship.”
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Serial mediation (also called chain mediation) involves two or more mediators arranged in a specific sequential order. The IV affects the first mediator, which in turn affects the second mediator, and so on, eventually influencing the DV.
<br><br>
<br>To investigate the process by which the IV impacts the DV through a chain of mediators, highlighting the step-by-step mechanism and temporal ordering of effects. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Generate scatterplots and residual vs. predicted plots for each link: IV → M1, M1 → M2, and M2 → DV.
<br>Use histograms and Q–Q plots for residuals in each regression.

<br>Criteria: As before, look for random dispersion, skewness &lt; |2.0|, kurtosis &lt; |7.0|, and Durbin–Watson between 1.5 and 2.5.


<br><br>
<br>There must be theoretical or empirical support for the hypothesized order (e.g., M1 influences M2).

<br>Run intermediate regressions (e.g., regress M2 on M1) and ensure that coefficients are significant (p &lt; .05) in line with your theory.


<br><br>
<br>Consider and control for variables that may confound the relationships between mediators if necessary.
<br><br>
<br>Go to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS vX.
<br>Choose Model 6 (designed for serial mediation).
<br>Enter the IV, DV, and mediators in the specific sequential order.
<br>Click Options:

<br>Enable bootstrapping (e.g., 5,000 samples) to obtain confidence intervals.


<br>Click OK.
<br><br>
<br>Path IV → Mediator 1:  

<br>Example: a1 = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001


<br>Path Mediator 1 → Mediator 2:  

<br>Example: d = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001


<br>Path Mediator 2 → DV (controlling for IV and M1):<br>
Example: b2 = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002
<br>Sequential Indirect Effect (IV → M1 → M2 → DV):<br>
Calculation: a1 × d × b2 = 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.30 = 0.0473

<br>Bootstrapped 95% CI: [0.01, 0.10] (if CI does not include zero, the effect is significant, e.g., p = .018).


<br>Direct Effect (IV → DV controlling for mediators):<br>
Example: c′ = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001
<br><br>
<br>A serial mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6) with 5,000 bootstrap samples to test whether [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] sequentially mediated the relationship between [IV] and [DV]. The analysis indicated that [IV] significantly predicted [Mediator 1] (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p = .001), and [Mediator 1] significantly predicted [Mediator 2] (b = 0.45, SE = 0.10, p = .001). Furthermore, [Mediator 2] significantly predicted [DV] (b = 0.30, SE = 0.08, p = .002). The sequential indirect effect was significant (b = 0.047, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p = .018), indicating that the effect of [IV] on [DV] was transmitted via [Mediator 1] and [Mediator 2] in sequence. The direct effect of [IV] on [DV] remained significant (b = 0.35, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001), suggesting partial mediation.
<br><br><br>
<br>Check Assumptions in SPSS:

<br>Generate scatterplots, residual vs. predicted plots, histograms, and Q–Q plots.
<br>Verify diagnostic values: skewness (&lt; |2.0|), kurtosis (&lt; |7.0|), Durbin–Watson (1.5–2.5), and inter-mediator correlations (r &lt; 0.80 for parallel mediation).
<br>For serial mediation, confirm intermediate regression steps are significant (p &lt; .05).


<br>Conduct Mediation Analysis with PROCESS:

<br>Use the appropriate model: Model 4 for simple and parallel mediation; Model 6 for serial mediation.
<br>Enter variables as specified and enable bootstrapping (commonly 5,000 samples) to generate 95% confidence intervals.


<br>Interpret Output:

<br>Evaluate p-values for each path (significant if p &lt; .05).
<br>For indirect effects, confirm that bootstrapped confidence intervals do not include zero.

<br>Access

<br>To international and cross-historical data would otherwise take years and millions of dollars to collect


<br>Quality

<br>Data collection process is informed by expertise and professionalism that may not be available to smaller research projects


<br>External Validity

<br>Studies funded by the government generally involve larger samples that are more representative of the target population. 


<br>Statistical Power

<br>Over sampling of low prevalence groups allows for increased power and precision


<br>Breadth

<br>Datasets often contain many variables


<br><br>
<br>Using it is the hardest part
<br>Study design and data collection already completed
<br>Data may lack depth. The greater the breadth the harder it is to measure a construct in depth. 

<br>Constructs may be defined by a single item or a subset of items that have reliability/validity concerns
<br>Posthoc measurement models maybe unsuccessful


<br>Certain fields or departments may place less value on secondary data analysis
<br>May require knowledge of survey statistics/methods which is not generally provided by basic graduate statistics courses.
<br>The temptation of a statistical fishing trip

<br>Great research is driven by a good research question that is shaped by theory
<br>Data analysis is done to refine our understanding of a topic and to develop theories by testing empirical hypotheses

<br><br>Secondary data analysis of large longitudinal and national data sets is a standard method used in many social sciences to answer complex questions regarding behavior. In this article, we detail the advantages of using these data sets to study developmental questions across the life span. First, we provide an overview of how using secondary data can increase studies’ scientiﬁc integrity. Then, we detail where and how data sets can be obtained that answer speciﬁc questions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues related to using longitudinal, population data sets. These data sets can enhance science and test theories by increasing the rigor and generalizability of research to the general population, making secondary data analysis an important method to consider.<br><br>

<br>Primary data are collected by an individual or a team of researchers and are often based on the theory or models of the researcher or research team. 

<br>These data are also generally proprietary and not shared with the larger research community. 
<br>In contrast, secondary data analysis uses data collected by other researchers or organizations, and the users are generally not part of the design of the study. These data sets (e.g., most national studies) have been collected for the use of the research community or have been made available for other researchers to use (e.g., in data archives).


<br><br>
<br>These data sets were collected based on the research theories and models of the primary researchers and include extensive measurements on the areas of interest to the research team. 
<br>Although some data sets remain proprietary to the original researcher or research team, new regulations on data sharing from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are increasing the amount of data available for secondary data analysis. 
<br>Many secondary data sets contain similarities in measurement that allow many data sets to be combined using techniques such as integrative data analysis, a technique that is especially useful for data sets that represent highly selective groups (e.g., children of alcoholics) that would be difficult to find in a general population sample. 
<br>Combining the data sets increases the sample size and thus the power to examine these groups. 
<br>Using secondary data sets, especially those collected at the population level, increases statistical power and external validity as a result of a larger sample size and greater diversity of respondents (with regard to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status).

<br>This advantage, combined with reducing the time and money it takes to collect one's own longitudinal data, makes secondary data analysis a good option.
<br>These data resources are easy to obtain.

<br>In the US, the two largest social science data archives are the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Murray Research Archive.<br>
<img alt="Social Science Secondary Data Archives Table.jpeg" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/social-science-secondary-data-archives-table.jpeg">
<br>ICPSR requires affiliation with a member institution. Some data sets are available for immediate download while others require an application explaining the scientific purpose for data use. 

<br>Data are generally free though fees may apply for digitization of not-yet digital materials or other labor-intensive data-preparation tasks. 


<br><br>
<br>Archives are easily searchable, including the ability to search by study topic or variable name. 

<br>Searching by study topic is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. Searching by variable name is helpful when the researcher is looking for studies focused on a specific subject. 
<br>Searching for variable name is helpful when the researcher is interested in a particular variable, such as rates of endorsement or forms of measurement of a variable across studies. 


<br>Most archives allow researchers to perform basic descriptive analyses online before downloading a data set, including frequency counts for each variable and tabular analysis. 
<br>Scientists can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in responses, or not too much missing data for the new study. 

<br>Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. 


<br><br>
<br>The most important step is to read all the data documentation - text documents posted in the data archive alongside the data. 
<br>Understanding and properly accounting for the sampling frame and necessary weights are crucial in producing accurate results, and the study documentation contains the necessary information. 
<br>Secondary data rarely have all the measures to answer investigators' questions. 

<br>Using data that have been collected by others typically means that measures for some of the constructs germane to the research question will be missing. 
<br>Because population data sets typically measure a broad set of constructs with limited measurement on any given construct, they often are not ideal for answering nuanced questions that require in-depth measurement. 
<br>Once a researcher has addressed the issue of obtaining the data set or sets to address his or her research questions and whether they adequately answer the relevant research questions, additional statistical issues must be considered in analyzing this data. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Because oversampling of one or more subpopulations is common in population-based studies, researchers often must apply a same weight if they want their findings to generalize to the target population. 
<br>Subpopulations that are underrepresented in the sample relative to the target population have sample weights larger than 1.0, while the opposite holds for subpopulations overrepresented in the sample relative to the target population. When no sample weights are applied, it is as if a sample weight of 1.0 is uniformly applied to all subpopulations. 
<br>In effect, this assumes all subpopulations are represented accurately within the sample, leading to biased estimates when this assumption does not hold. 

<br>Typically, the appropriate set of sample weights and its corresponding variable name are identified clearly within a data set's documentation files. 


<br><br>
<br>In contrast to sample weights, which adjust for <a data-href="Sampling Bias" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/sampling-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sampling Bias</a>, attrition weights correct for bias introduced by attrition. 

<br>The objective of attrition weights is to render the Wave 2 sample comparable to the full Wave 1 sample. Mathematically, attrition weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition or dropping out: P (Wave 1) / (Wave 2)


<br>Combination weights (also called longitudinal weights) adjust for both sampling bias and attrition bias. Mathematically, combination weights are the inverse of the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., the sample weight) multiplied by the inverse of the likelihood of being lost to attrition (i.e., the attrition weight): [P (target population) / P (sample)] x [P (Wave 1) / P (Wave 2)].
<br>We suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights (either alone or as a part of combination weights) and instead of using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), or multiple imputation (MI) to adjust for attrition bias and then use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias. 

<br>We make this recommendation because relative to FIML and MI, attrition weights (including combination weights) have two disadvantages:

<br>Unlike FIML and MI, attrition weights often sharply reduce the analytical sample size and, thereby, statistical power. Typically, only those participants with data at every wave are assigned an attrition weight and used in subsequent analyses. 
<br>This problem is compounded as a study's number of waves (and therefore attrition) increases. Second, if many auxiliary variables (i.e., non-model variables related to missing data) are incorporated, FIML and MI may adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights. 


<br>Most statistical packages can use FIML, including STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS, and AMOS, and many use MI (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS).


<br><br>
<br>Most large-scale data sets were collected using complex sample designs that entail a clustered sampling design (e.g., schools are randomly sampled and then all students within the selected schools are sampled). 

<br>Because a clustered sampling design reduces variance (e.g., 100 students from the same school are likely more similar to one another demographically than are 100 students from 100 different schools), it also reduces standard errors and thereby inflates the change for <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>.


<br>To adjust for these design effects, a primary sampling unit variable (e.g., schools) and potentially a stratification variable are incorporated into analyses. 

<br>Most statistical packages (e.g., STATA, SAS, Mplus, R, SPSS) can adjust for a complex sampling design and typically the appropriate primary sampling unit and, if necessary, stratification variables are clearly identified within a data set's documentation files.

<br>Title: The Art of Data Science, 
<br>Author: Peng, Roger D; Matsui, Elizabeth;  
<br>Year: 2018 
<br><br><br>
<br>Keywords: In Progress
<br><br><br>
<br>The thinking begins before you even look at a dataset, and it's well worth devoting careful thought to your question. This point cannot be over-emphasized as many of the 'fatal' pitfalls of data analysis can be avoided by expending the mental energy to get your question right. 
<br><br>
<br>There are six basic types of questions. 

<br>Descriptive
<br>Exploratory
<br>Inferential
<br>Predictive
<br>Causal
<br>Mechanistic


<br>Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. 
<br>The type of question you are asking directly informs how you interpret your results. 
<br>A descriptive question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. 

<br>There is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the set of data that you are working with. 


<br>An exploratory question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. 

<br>These types of analyses are also called 'hypothesis-generating' analyses because rather than testing a hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question, you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. 


<br>An inferential question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data. 
<br>A predictive question would be one where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. 
<br>A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. 

<br>Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal. 
<br>In other instances, even if your data are not from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer a causal question. 


<br>A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a mechanistic question. 
<br>By necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions. 

<br>If a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering the inferential question. 
<br>The type of question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis).
<br>If this type of data set does not exist, then the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illness. 


<br><br>
<br>Establish your expectations about the question
<br>Gathering information about your question
<br>Determining if your expectations match the information you gathered, and then refining your question (or expectations) if your expectations did not match the information you gathered. 
<br><br>
<br>There are five key characteristics of a good question for a data analysis, which range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already been answered to the more abstract characteristic that each of the possible answers to the question should have a single interpretation and be meaningful. 

<br>The question should be of interest to your audience, the identity of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with data.
<br>You should also check that the question has not already been answered. With the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon to discover that your question of interest has been answered already.
<br>The question should also stem from a plausible framework.

<br>If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end up with an answer that's difficult to interpret or have confidence in. 
<br>Many questions are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible framework.


<br>The question, should also, of course, be answerable.
<br>Specificity is also an important characteristic of a good question.

<br>Working towards specificity will refine your question and directly inform what steps to take when you start looking at data.
<br>With this degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will either recommend or not recommend the specific action. 




<br><br>
<br>Another aspect to consider when you’re developing your question is what will happen when you translate it into a data problem. Every question must be operationalized as a data analysis that leads to a result. 

<br>Pausing to think through what the results of the data analysis would look like and how they might be interpreted is important as it can prevent you from wasting a lot of time embarking on an analysis whose result is not interpretable.


<br>The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question that uses inappropriate data.

<br>The problem with this question is that for a single possible answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations arises when at least one of the variables you use is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after. 
<br>To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required to answer your question. 


<br>A related problem that intergeres with interpretation of results is confounding. 

<br>Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship between factors. 
<br>A brief description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both your exposure of interest and your outcome of interest. 
<br>As you refine your question, spend time identifying the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information about these potential confounders. 


<br>Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a biased result. 
<br>The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics above what exists in the general population. 

<br>A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors, bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person might recall the past when responding to a survey. 
<br>The best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the question with the data available to you.

<br>Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. 
<br>Henry Taube (who won the Novel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. 

<br>That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. 
<br>The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I did not know was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. 


<br>We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right answer or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. 

<br>Doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. 
<br>We don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid - that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. 
<br>Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity.' that kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. 

<br>Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, ‘I don’t know’. The point of the exam isn’t to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it’s the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student’s weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student’s knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project.




<br>Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. 

<br>The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.

<br><br>
<br>Before you put pen to paper (or analyze data), formulate a research question. 

<br>A research question is a statement that identifies the phenomenon to be studied. 
<br>For example, "Does preschool influence children's language skills?"


<br>Why are good research questions important and what makes them 'good?'

<br>Purpose
<br>Relevance
<br>Feasibility


<br><br><br>
<br>To produce a research question, you need to know the literature first. 
<br>Find out what has been done and how you can contribute to the existing literature. 
<br><br>
<br>I have a research question.

<br>If you do not have a research question, narrow down your topic. 


<br>Review the literature
<br>Is the question viable, original. feasible?
<br>You have a research question!
<br><br>
<br>Narrow down on an area of interest
<br>Within that area, try to answer a question that:

<br>Has either not been addressed before
<br>Has been addressed before but that you could extend (i.e., new data-set, different approach, etc.)
<br>Has been addressed but requires replication
<br>Starts a new research area (NOT recommended)


<br><br>
<br>Read as much as you can on the topic
<br>Read recent studies first, then read backwards
<br>Read all relevant papers (or at least the influential ones)
<br>Ideas on the research topic often come from reading
<br>The more you read, the easier it will be to come up with research questions
<br><br>
<br>Reviewing the literature will allow you to understand whether your question has been answered/is valid.
<br>By reading previous studies, you might get ideas on how to tweak your original research question into a new one. 
<br>Whether you have or do not have a research question, it is crucial that you review the literature in the area first. 
<br>Many leave the review as the last step, but this is dangerous.
<br><br><br>
<br>Not original
<br>Not feasible

<br>Time constraint (e.g., not enough time)
<br>Resources (e.g., lack of data)
<br>Knowledge (e.g., do I know method X?)


<br>Too broadly defined research question
<br>Not well justified
<br>Not motivated by literature
<br><br>
<br>Start searching for a topic as early as possible
<br>Once you narrow down a topic/area, look at the relevant literature (i.e., a literature review)
<br>Once you have done the literature review (has it already been done? No, why not? Is it interesting/relevant?), then ask yourself:

<br>Is the question specific (not too broad)?
<br>Is it feasible in the allotted time?
<br>Do I have enough resources (data) to answer this question?
<br>How about knowledge (methods)?
<br>Is the research question falling within my area of research?
<br>If the answer is yes to all the previous question, congratulations, you have a research question. 


<br>Your time is your most important resource. 
<br>Do not take a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances)

<br>Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic/data set
<br>More efficient time use (e.g., read similar lit)
<br>Looks good when others are evaluating your CV


<br>A good research question will

<br>Allow outsiders to see your intentions
<br>Help you develop hypotheses (not always)
<br>Contributes to existing knowledge

<br>Contribution does not have to be huge
<br>Replication is a contribution
<br>Filling a gap is not enough justification, why does this gap matter?


<br>Guide the design of your methods
<br>Allow the target population to be identified
<br>Identify the outcome variables and key predictors of those variables
<br>Determine what type of study is needed (e.g., descriptive, correlational, experimental)
<br>Identify background characteristics that might influence predictors and outcomes
<br>Raise questions about how to best collect data
<br>Influence the number of participants in the study


<br>Writing a good question is an iterative process

<br>What do you want to learn about?
<br>Draft and redraft with increasing specificity using the guidelines listed above. 
<br>Ask for feedback from colleagues (science is a collective effort).
<br>Build on the work of others by conducting a systematic literature review. 


<br><br>
<br>This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. 

<br>Hook the reader in. 
<br>Practice!


<br><br>
<br>Explain the larger context that this study will inform. 
<br>Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know.
<br><br>
<br>Flows directly from the earlier points in paragraph 1. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. 
<br>State the basic aims, hypotheses, questions, and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths)
<br><br>
<br>Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph - could be theoretically, in terms of policy, filling holes, etc. 
<br>Can be combined with paragraph 2 in some cases. 
<br><br>
<br>"The scientific literature is our institutional memory. It is important that this literature accurately reflect what happened, who did it, and to what extend one observation is independent of another." - Dennis McInerney

<br>A researcher was interested in changes in marital quality and recruited a sample of newlywed couples and annually collected data from them over five years. The main question of interest was the extent to which personality traits at the time of marriage predict marital satisfaction and marital commitment post marriage. The researcher wrote two papers. One focused on the prediction of marital satisfaction, and the other focused on the prediction of marital commitment. The design of the study was he same in each paper, with the exception of the change in outcomes. 

<br>Piecemeal


<br>A researcher recruited newlyweds and planned annual assessments over a five years. Some measures were assessments over a five years. Some measures were common to each annual assessment, whereas others common to each annual assessment, whereas others were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote were not. After the first wave of data collection, she wrote an article regarding the relation between divorce history an article regarding the relation between divorce history and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data and marital satisfaction. After three waves of data collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made collection, she wrote an article on how couples who made the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital the transition to parenthood differed in changes in marital satisfaction from those who did not experience the satisfaction from those who did not experience the transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a transition. After five waves of data collection, she wrote a third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The third article on the predictors of marital dissolution. The researcher decided to publish these as three separate researcher decided to publish these as three separate articles.

<br>Not Piecemeal


<br>Researcher B was interested in the relation between family process and adolescent adjustment. She conducted and published a study in which the main conducted and published a study in which the main objective was to identify specific family processes that objective was to identify specific family processes that mediated the relation between family structure and mediated the relation between family structure and adjustment. Later, she read a new study that proposed that two of the family processes that she studied had an interactive effect on adjustment. Although such an interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, interactive effect was not of interest in the original study, in additional analyses she found that such an effect did occur in her sample, although in a slightly different than in the newly published article. She wrote a second article to address this issue.

<br>Not Piecemeal


<br>A researcher was interested in the extent to which support for marriage from family and friends affects rating of relationship quality. He collected data from a large convenience sample. Although not planned, the sample contained about 60% of persons in their first marriages and 40% of persons in remarriages. The researcher prepared two papers that examined the question of interest. In the first paper, he used data from the first-marriage subjects, whereas in the second paper he used data from the remarried subjects. The variables assessed and reported in the two papers were the same. 

<br>Piecemeal


<br>A researcher was interested in the links between family structure and child adjustment. The researcher administered a survey to high school students. She discovered that there were large numbers in two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families, but very few students were in the single divorced father and stepmother families as part of the survey, students in stepfamilies answered survey items regarding the parenting behaviors of their stepparents as well as of their parents. She wrote two papers. The first examined differences in adjustment in children from two-biological parent, single divorced mother, and stepfather families (the groups with the largest sample sizes). To facilitate the interpretation of family structure effects, she decided to exclude the rather small number of students in the second paper, she explored whether children's adjustment was related to how they rated the parenting behaviors of their parents and stepparents. 

<br>Not Piecemeal


<br>A researcher was interested in rates of divorce in first-marriages and remarriages in different countries. She obtained data from an international organization that contained information on a number of different countries and wrote two papers. The first addressed the divorce rates in these two kinds of couples in Canada, and the second dealt with the same issue in England. The same theoretical rationale and measures were used in both papers, although the results led to different conclusions. 

<br>Piecemeal


<br>Focus on quality and not quantity of publications
<br><br>
<br>Replicate the study with a different sample, setting, or methodology. 

<br>Do this if most of the past research you have read examines one type of sample, setting, or method. 


<br>Examine the topic using a different design. If the study was a quasi- or non-experimental, conduct an experiment. 

<br>Do this if causation has not been consistently established by past research, or it has not been consistently established with the population you are interested in. 


<br>Examine how another variable might impact results

<br>Do this if you have research evidence to suggest that results may depend on another variable. 


<br>Conduct a similar study with a different outcome or dependent variable.

<br>Do this if you find research evidence supporting the new associations you plan to examine. 


<br><br>
<br>Being first is not always a sign of being a good scientist

<br>Many discoveries are wrong or over claimed. 


<br><br>
<br>You do not show you are a great scientist by being the first to claim something. 
<br>A large part of getting over being scooped is getting over yourself and realizing that science is bigger than any one of us. 
<br>It also means you are doing something other people care about. 
<br>If you are scooped, do not be discouraged. It is unlikely that any two researchers would address a question in the exact same way.

<br>Many datasets have both public and restricted files.
<br>Restricted data contains more data and a wider range of data values than are included in public use data. 
<br>For most, the public-use files provide all the data they will need for most analyses, though some users may find that only the restricted files have the specific data they need. 

<br>If you are not sure, first examine the public-use data. 


<br>Outliers (unusually high or unusually low values) are top- or bottom-coded to prevent identification of unique schools, teachers, parents, and children without affecting overall data quality.

<br>Variables with too few cases and/or a sparse distribution are suppressed. The values for these variables are set to -2 and labelled 'suppressed' in the Electronic Codebook (ECB). The value -2 means that the data for this variable are suppressed to protect the respondent's confidentiality. 
<br>Variables that provide a particularly identifying characteristic, such as a specific disability, or information that could be matched against external data sources to obtain a specific identifying characteristic, such as exact date of marriage or divorce, are also suppressed.

<br>Submit signed license document

<br>Primary researcher

<br>Submit signed and notarized affidavits of nondisclosure for all proposed users. 
<br>Submit a signed security plan (must specify the exact locked location) where the data will be secured. You cannot transmit restricted-use data.
<br>Maintain a data license file and ensure that all authorized users follow the agreed upon terms. 
<br>Participate in unannounced security inspections to ensure compliance. 
<br>Adhere to established publication rules. 
<br>Submit all materials for disclosure review. 
<br>Complete annual trainings online. 
<br>Complete yearly reports of what work you have done.

<br>Start with a broad question. 

<br>Think about who might collect that data (e.g., governments, other researchers, etc.)


<br>Want to stick close to a specific subfield or type of data?

<br>Look for recognized repositories in your field, large research projects, or publications that have data access statements. 


<br>Likely need to combine several search strategies. 
<br>Remember

<br>Some disciplines have more of a tradition of sharing
<br>Non-sensitive data are easier to obtain than sensitive data


<br><img alt="3. Sharing and Accessing Secondary Data-4.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/3.-sharing-and-accessing-secondary-data-4.png">

<br><br>
<br>Archives are easily searchable

<br>Searching by study topic is helpful when you are looking for studies focused on a specific subject. 
<br>Searching by variable name is helpful when you are interested in a particular variable (e.g., spanking). 


<br>Often, studies are organized into collections in each archive so a researcher can quickly identify groups of studies focused on a particular subarea. 
<br>The organization of each archive varies, but most share several major features. 
<br>Most archives allow you to perform basic descriptive analyses before the downloading a dataset.

<br>This is great because you can determine whether a variable of interest has a large enough sample size, enough variance in repsonses, for your purposes. 


<br>Such online analyses are also useful for testing a new hypothesis before collecting new data on the topic or performing preliminary analyses for grant applications. 
<br>Most archives offer FAQs, tips for effective searching, and access to staff members via email.

<br>How to search for publications
<br>How to look at descriptive within and across studies
<br>How to look for studies and variables within studies
<br>Study usage reports


<br><br>
<br>Subject Matter

<br>Consider whether the subject is consistent with your problem definition and whether the data apply to the time/population of interest


<br>Methods

<br>Consider whether the data can be used with your preferred method of analysis or if you'll need ot learn a new skill. 


<br>Measurement

<br>Determine whether the data capture the measures and constructs you are interested in with sufficient/adequate detail. 


<br>Time

<br>You will save time on data collection and get access to larger scale data, but may spend more time on cleaning, modifying, getting documentation, etc. 


<br>License/Copyright

<br>Is the data licensed? Does it restrict usage?


<br>Terms of Use

<br>Are the terms you need to meet to gain access to the data or other restrictions?


<br>Citations

<br>You will want to formally cite the data you use; data sets should have a persistent identifier to help cite the data, such as DOI. 


<br>Documentation

<br>Look for good documentation on how the data was collected, for what purpose, how it was transformed. 


<br>Credibility

<br>Is the data from a recognized lab, researcher, institution? Do the publications based on the data hold?


<br><br><br>
<br>Does the dataset contain the information you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?
<br>Do the measures used match those you require?
<br>Is the data set a proxy for the data you really need?
<br>Does the dataset cover the population that is the subject of your research?
<br>Does the dataset cover the geographical area that is the subject of your research?
<br>Can data about the population that is the subject of your research be separated from unwanted data?
<br>Are the data for the right time period or sufficiently up to date?
<br>Are data available for all the variables you require to answer your research question(s) and meet your objectives?
<br>Are the variables defined clearly?
<br><br>
<br>How reliable is the dataset?
<br>How credible is the data source?
<br>Is it clear what the source of the data is?
<br>Do the credentials of the source of the data (author, institution, or organization sponsoring the data) suggest it is likely to be reliable?
<br>Do the data have an associated copyright statement?
<br>Do associated published documents exist?
<br>Does the source contain contact details for obtaining further information about the data?
<br>Is the method described clearly?
<br>If sampling was used, what was the procedure and what were the associated sampling errors and response rates?
<br>Who was responsible for collecting or recording the data?
<br>(For surveys) Is a copy of the questionnaire or interview checklist included?
<br>(For compiled data) Are you clear how the data were analyzed and compiled?
<br>Are the data likely to contain measurement bias?
<br>What was the original purpose for which the data were collected?
<br>Who was the target
<br><br>
<br>The most important step is to read ALL the data documentation. 
<br><br>
<br>Before assessing data, review codebooks and questionnaires

<br>What information was collected
<br>For whom and when and where
<br>What changes were made before archiving


<br>Codebooks also include other information (e.g., topics addressed, questions and measurements used, frequency of responses or values, how to use the data, etc.)
<br>Like a regular book, some codebooks are better than others. 
<br>If people code the variable in a certain way, is there potential for error? Would two researchers get the same outcomes if they chose to code the variable differently?

<br>There are two ways to operate STATA
<br><br>
<br>Commands can be types directly into the Command window and executed by pressing Enter. 
<br><br>
<br>Commands can be written in a separate file (called a do-file) and executed together in one step.

<br>List of all the commands you need for your project
<br>No need to repeat work; recreate your dataset by running the do-file
<br>Easy to correct mistakes you find later
<br>To create / edit do-file:

<br>Starting a new do-file: doedit
<br>Editing an existing do-file: doedit DOFILENAME.do
<br>Type in commands
<br>Save do-file (control + s)


<br>To use

<br>Do DOFILENAME.Do


<br>Try to be organized

<br>Use headings
<br>For all test in do-flies that are not commands, begin the line with *


<br><br>
<br>Log records all commands and output during the session
<br>To use:

<br>Open new log

<br>Log using LOGNAME.log / cmdlog using CLOGNAME.log


<br>Write over an existing log

<br>Log using LOGNAME.log / cmdlog using CMDLOGNAME.log, replace


<br>Add to an existing log

<br>Log using LOGNAME.log / cmdlog using CMDLOGNAME.log, append


<br>To close log

<br>Log close / cmdlog close




<br><br>
<br>To read a file using the command window

<br>Use "C:...\sample.dta", clear use sample.dta, clear


<br>To save a file

<br>Save "C:...\sample.dta" [, replace]

<br><br>
<br>The general syntax for all STATA commands is:<br>
[prefix:] cmdname [varlist] [=exp] [if exp] [in exp] [weight] [using filename] [, options]
<br>Elements in square brackets are optional for some commands
<br>Sometimes cmdname is all that is required, for example, codebook or describe
<br>STATA is case sensitive<br>

<br><br>
<br>New variables can be created using generate

<br>Gen racev2 = race


<br>New variable can contain functions or combinations of existing variables

<br>Gen income = inc1 + inc2 + inc3
<br>You can use *, +, -, /, ^


<br>Replace may be used to change the contents of an existing variable

<br>Replace oldvar = exp1 [if exp2]


<br>Always recommend that you do not save over original values.
<br>'If' is used to restrict the command to a desired subset of observations:

<br>Replace race =. If race == 999


<br>The double == sign is used to test for equality, while the single sign is used for assignment
<br>Operators can be used after if:

<br>&amp; denotes 'and'
<br>| denotes 'or'
<br>~ or ! Denote 'not'


<br>Rename may be used to rename variables

<br>Rename oldvarname newvarname


<br>To drop a variable or variables, type

<br>Drop varlist


<br>Alternatively, keep varlist eliminates everything but varlist
<br>To drop certain observations, use

<br>Drop if exp
<br>For example, drop if unemplrate==


<br><br>
<br>Dataset in memory is called 'master dataset'
<br>Dataset filename is called 'using dataset'
<br>Variables with same name will be combined
<br>Variables in only one dataset will have missing values for observations from the other dataset. 
<br>To join corresponding observations from a STATA dataset with those in the dataset in memory, type:

<br>Merge 1:1 varlist using filename

<br>If more than one observations has the same value of varlist in the master dataset, use:

<br>Merge m: 1 varlist using filename


<br>To add another STATA dataset below the end of the dataset in memory, type:

<br>Append using filename

<br><br>
<br>As you are making decisions regarding your variables, consider the following questions:

<br>How will constructs be operationalized?
<br>What items will be used and which measures are critical to the tests?
<br>If multiple measures are available, what will be done?


<br>These issues often require quite a bit of conceptual considerations and defending in the peer-review process. 
<br><br>
<br>In big datasets, measures are often abbreviated. 
<br>Measurement problems arise when

<br>The concept to be measured are vague or poorly defined
<br>Indicators are imperfect measures of the underlying construct
<br>Individual responses are inaccurate (e.g., distraction, illness, poor comprehension)
<br>Errors lead to erroneous values


<br>Accuracy

<br>The closeness of the measurement to the true value


<br>Bias

<br>A systematic variation of measurements from the quality being measured


<br>Precision

<br>The closeness of repeated measurements to one another

<br>Why do we test for reliability in subpopulations?

<br>Establish the psychometric properties of a new or existing measure/assessment tool

<br>Means for determining generalizeability
<br>Are we measuring the same construct in the same way across groups or across time?


<br>Increase confidence that observed differences between groups reflect true differences and not those ties to measurement. 


<br>Reliability within subgroups is often assumed but rarely tested and is a big issue for many datasets that do not use previously validated meaures. 
<br><br>
<br>Why use existing composites?

<br>Data availability: you often may not have all necessary data to create the composite
<br>Reproducibility: everyone uses the same construct
<br>Convenience: time and effort spent on identifying possible composites and determining best source of information to creating them


<br>But first, always read the user's guide and when item level data are available, check yourself!

Sampling & Complex Designs]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br><br>
<br>Why should we strive for population representative sampling?

<br>Important for policy or practice. We do not want to recommend changes that are not based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact. 


<br>How?

<br>Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)
<br>Work on large teams
<br>Use secondary data


<br><br>
<br>Normally used to compensate for over- and under-sampling of individuals
<br>Example

<br>It is common to over-sample minority groups... If we doubled the size of our minority sample, then each minority case would get a design weight of 1/2 or .5. 


<br>We use the design weight when we want the statistics to be representative of the population. 
<br><br>
<br>Used to compensate for the fact that persons with certain characteristics are not as likely to respond to the survey. 
<br>Example

<br>Most population surveys have substantially more female than male respondents; because surveys over-represents females and under-represents males in the population, a weight is used to compensate for this bias. 


<br>There are many responsent characteristics that are likely to be related to the propensity to respond such as age, education, race/ethnicity, place of residence. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Dataset with cases

<br>Simple mean

<br>(4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 2.8


<br>Weighted mean

<br>{(4  1) + (2  2) + (1  4) + (5  1) + (2 * 2)} / 10 = 2.1




<br><br>
<br>With unweighted data, each case is counted equally
<br>With weighted data, each case is counted relative to its representation in the population
<br>Unweighted data represent only those in the sample who provide data
<br>Weights allow analyses that represent the target population<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs.png">
<br><br>
<br>Most STATA commands can deal with weighted data, where the weight is a variable in the dataset. 
<br>You need to specify the type of weight and the weight variable, using brackets at the end of your command, as in:<br>
summarize x [weight=weightvarname]<br>
tab x [weight=weightvarname]<br>
regress y x [weight=weightvarname]
<br>There are 4 types of weights in STATA, but for most data analyses you will use one of the following:

<br>Probability pweights, for observations sampled with unequal probability of selection. Use this for inferential analyses.
<br>Analytic aweights, for data containing averages where the average is weighted by the # obs used in calculating the average…. Use this for your descriptive statistics.


<br><br><img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-1.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-1.png"><br><br>
<br>Different studies create different types of weights... Some data create weights depending on:

<br>Level of analysis (child, teacher, or school)
<br>Type of analysis (cross-sectional vs. Longitudinal)
<br>Source of data (child assessment, parent interview, teacher questionnaires, etc.)
<br>For example, the ECLS-K has ~ 105 different options


<br><br>
<br>Many suggest you use combination weights when estimating longitudinal analyses because they assume that these users will not adjust for attrition on their own. 
<br>I suggest avoiding the use of attrition weights. 

<br>Instead, use modern missing data procedures for attrition bias, and use the appropriate sample weight to adjust for sampling bias


<br>I make this recommendation because attrition weights have two key disadvantages

<br>Attrition weights often reduce the analytical sample size, and thereby, statistical power. 
<br>If many non-model variables related to missing data are incorporated, missing data techniques adjust for attrition bias more effectively than attrition weights


<br><br>
<br>Use weights whenever possible, but some methods do not allow weights
<br>Steps to follow to avoid vias in unweighted analyses

<br>Include as <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> that might account for the sample design or non-response
<br>If a weight is available, it can also be included as an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">IV</a>
<br>If the weight is associated with the outcom ein a model including the design variables, then the weight is likely to have been constructed in a way related to your outcome; bias is possile. 
<br>E.g., some multilevel models, some structural equation programs, etc. 


<br><br>
<br>National samples are first divided into primary sampling units... What these units are depends on the study.<br>
- E.g., in many data of the US the PSUs are geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-2.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-2.png">
<br><br>
<br>After identifying PSUs, then PSUs are stratified into groups. 
<br>These groups are formed to keep similar units together... How many and what types of strata are determined by study goals.<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-3.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-3.png"><br>
Then within each strata, and within PSUs, you sample
<br><br>
<br>Software can make the adjustment... A few different approaches with the easiest being the Taylor Series approach

<br>Use primary sampling unit (PSU) and strata variables in the data file. 
<br>The strata and PSU identifiers are often associated with a specific sampling weight variable. 
<br>For example, in the ECLS-K the weight C1CW0 has the following strata and PSU: C1TVWSTR and C1TCWPSU


<br><br>svyset PSU [pweight = WEIGHT], strata(STRATA)<br>
<br>Then use svy: before your subsequent commands (e.g., svy: tab or svy: mean or svy: regress)
<br>svy: will NOT work with all commands
<br>svy: mean and mean [weight = weight] yield the same mean estimates… it is the SEs that are different)<br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-4.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-4.png"><br>
<img alt="7. Sampling &amp; Complex Designs-5.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/7.-sampling-&amp;-complex-designs-5.png">
<br><br>
<br>Weights should be used when analyzing data from national samples; otherwise, you cannot make claims about representativeness
<br>The appropriate weight should be selected based on:

<br>Level of analysis
<br>Round (s) of data
<br>Source (s) of data


<br>There may not be a 'perfect' weight for many analyses
<br>All statistical tests should be based on standard errors that account for complex sample design

 <br>This classwork/homework assignment is a multiple imputation activity. You will continue to use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2011 Cohort.&nbsp;The classwork/homework write-up is due by Tuesday at 11:59PM (3/18).&nbsp;The data you need come from two sources. The first is the data file you have been working on for class activities the last several week. The second is located in this week's folder.  <br>A researcher wants to know whether maternal depressive symptoms are associated with children’s early learning and development. But before the researcher can address this question, you are asked to think about and address missing data. The researcher has provided you with several variables in addition to the variables you have worked with thus far:<br>
<br>You are asked to include an overall composite of depressive symptoms. The research provides you with 12 items that you are asked to composite (P2BOTHER P2APPETI P2BLUE P2KPMIND P2DEPRES P2EFFORT P2FEARFL P2RESTLS P2TALKLS P2LONELY P2SAD P2NOTGO).
<br>You will also include three child variables: a) a variable capturing children’s academic achievement, b) a variable capturing children’s socioemotional skills, and c) a variable capturing children’s executive functioning. For the academic achievement measure, you will need to create a new composite variable that is composed of reading, math, and science (X2RSCALK4 X2MSCALK4 X2SSCALK4). For socioemotional skills, you will need to create a new variable that is the average of teacher reports of self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior (i.e.,&nbsp;X2TCHINT X2TCHEXT X2TCHCON X2TCHPER). Children’s executive functioning skills are captured with a single item:&nbsp;X2DCCSTOT.
<br>The researcher also wants you to include covariates/indicators for race/ethnicity (X_RACETH_R), child sex (X_CHSEX_R), income (X2INCCAT_I), parents’ marital status (P1CURMAR), parents physical health (P2HEALTH), household members under 18 (X1LESS18), and household members over 18 (X1OVER18) .
<br>With that in mind...<br>Step 1: You need to merge the new data into the dataset you have been working with. This requires a 1 to 1 merge using CHILDID. This step will be graded via your do/log files (.25 points)<br>Step 2: Once the data are merged, examine your data. Orient yourself to the old and new variables (e.g., are they continuous, categorical etc etc) and&nbsp;recode&nbsp;any new variables as appropriate. Recall how Stata recognizes missing data. Please also&nbsp;create&nbsp;the appropriate composites&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to imputation. The composites will be what you will use in your imputation.&nbsp;If you recode other variables, please provide a justification. This step will be graded via your do/log files and your justification in your word document. (.25 points)  <br>Step 3: Once you have cleaned your data,&nbsp;run&nbsp;some descriptives for all of your variables (including your covariates) and determine the degree of missing values for each variable. Please also estimate a correlation matrix for your focal independent and dependent variables (do&nbsp;not&nbsp;include the list of covariates for your correlation matrix). What &nbsp;patterns you notice from the descriptive statistics? How much missing data are there for the variables? What patterns do you notice from the correlation matrix? (1.00 point)  <br>Step 4:&nbsp;Determine&nbsp;whether data are MCAR. Examine and discuss the missing data patterns. Are there common patterns of missing data? Are there uncommon patterns of missing data? Anything you notice worth discussing? If data are not MCAR, discuss whether the data may meet assumptions of MAR or MNAR. Why or why not? If you have any concerns proceeding to imputation, discuss it here. (1.25 points)  <br>Step 5:&nbsp;Run&nbsp;an imputation model with 10 datasets. Make sure you specify each variable correctly. And remember to&nbsp;upload&nbsp;your do and log files (for the entire assignment). This step will be graded via your do file (1.00 point)  <br>Step 6: After you have run your imputation,&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;descriptives&nbsp;within&nbsp;the 10 imputed datasets. You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to do this for every variable. Run these descriptives for the focal variables of interest (depressive symptoms, children's academic achievement, social skills, and executive functioning). Use the mi xeq command (e.g., mi xeq: sum XYZ). Discuss what you notice about the means/SDs across the imputations. (1.00 point)<br>Step 7.&nbsp;Estimate&nbsp;correlations (use mi xeq: corr) among your focal variables from step 1, but this time&nbsp;within&nbsp;your 10 datasets. Are there any similarities between the imputed and non-imputed data? Are there any other differences you notice? (.75 points)  <br>Step 8. Upload your word document, log file, and do file. Please upload stata versions of your log/do files (not copied/pasted into word).]]></description><link>https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/current/secondary-data-analysis/assignment-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/Current/Secondary Data Analysis/Assignment 4.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:51:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contextual Outlier]]></title><description><![CDATA[
