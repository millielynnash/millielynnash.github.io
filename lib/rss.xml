<br>Collaborative alliance: models and provides a secure base. 
<br>Emotion is primary in organizing attachment behaviora and the ways self and other are experienced in intimate relationships (primary and secondary emotions)
<br>Attachments are adaptive and healthy
<br>Problems are maintained by interaction patterns and by the dominant organization of emotional experience of each partner. 
<br>Change occurs through new emotional experience in the context of attachment-salient interactions as they occur in session. (make it important to attachment, example: new parents, partners are not used to the difference in attachment and time spent in the relationship)
<br>The 'client' is the relationship. 
<br>
<br>Gas lighting is an attachment injury
<br><br>
<br>Creation of new cycles of secure bonding, which offer an antidote to negative cycles and positively redefine the nature of the relationship.
<br><br>
<br>Create a safe, collaborative alliance. 
<br>Access, reformulate, and expand the emotional responses that guide the couple's interaction. 
<br>Restructure those interactions in the direction of the accessibility and responsiveness that builds, secure lasting bonds. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Step 1: Identify the relational conflict issues. 
<br>Step 2: Identify the negative interaction cycle
<br>Step 3: Access the unacknowledged attachment oriented emotions underlying the interaction cycle. 
<br>Step 4: Reframe the problem in terms of the cycle, underlying emotions that accompany it, and attachment vulnerabilities and needs. 
<br><br>
<br>Step 5: Promote identification with disowned attachment needs and aspects of self. 
<br>Step 6: Promote each partner's acceptance of the other's experience. 
<br>Step 7: Facilitate the expression of needs and wants to restructure the interactional based on new understandings and to create bonding events. 
<br><br>
<br>Step 8: Facilitate the emergence of new solutions to old problems. 
<br>Step 9: Consolidate new positions and cycles of attachment behavior. 
<br><br>
<br>Alliance
<br>Commenting on the process, and interpreting with attachment language to draw out each partner's emotional experience. 
<br>Enactments with expanded emotional experiences. 
<br>Commenting on the experiences so that they can be integrated. 
<br>How can we help you process when you get loud?

 <br><br>
<br>Most relationship conflict is not solvable, but perpetual based on personality characteristics of the partners. This can lead to grid lock. 

<br>Gridlock conflict is about the escalation of negative affect reciprocity


<br>To get 'dialogue' with a perpetual issue, you have to understand the existential nature of it or the 'dreams within conflict'
<br>Building positivity during non-conflict and conflict is essential for lasting change. 
<br>Friendship processes control the effectiveness and thresholds of the repair of problematic interaction. 
<br>Couple's construction of a 'shared meaning system' facilitates stability and happiness. 
<br>Three systems need to be understood (conflict, friendship/intimacy/positive affect, and shared meaning) need to be understood to intervene. 
<br><br>
<br>For Gottman, theory must provide a 'recipe' for therapeutic change
<br><br>
<br>Repair:

<br>Processing fights and regrettable incidents. 


<br>Reduce the use of the 4 Horsemen. 
<br>Gottman-Rapport Blueprint for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Clinic Resources/Clinic Media/Practice Exercise (Speaker Listener Activity)" data-href="Clinic Resources/Clinic Media/Practice Exercise (Speaker Listener Activity)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Clinic Resources/Clinic Media/Practice Exercise (Speaker Listener Activity)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Practice Exercise (Speaker Listener Activity)</a> (postpone persuasion, until both partners acknowledge the others perspective and emotion to the other's satisfaction)
<br>Problem-solving, persuasion, and compromise
<br>Blueprint for perpetual unsolvable conflict (Dreams within conflict, one person takes a turn while the other person is listen, not trying to persuade, the objective is to reflect back what you hear)
<br>Down-regulating negative affect with physiological soothing (biofeedback)
<br><br>
<br>Get couples to notice positives and accept influence. 

<br>They are going to acknowledge their partner.


<br><br>
<br>Help couples turn toward each other when bids for connection are made. 
<br>Build positive affect separately from helping to decrease ineffective conflict. 
<br>'Savor' positive affect
<br>5 to 1 ratio vs. 0.8 to 1
<br><br>
<br>Emotional connection during everyday moments (build love maps, build a culture of appreciation, turn towards bids for connection, engage in emotion coaching, increase and savor positive affect)
<br>Daily stress-reducing conversation
<br>Build affection, good sex, romance, and passion
<br>Process failed bods for emotional connection
<br><br>
<br>Here they move to more emotion focused techniques, and theory, using a metaphor of attachment +
<br>Use card decks to help couple members identify emotions, talk about their beliefs about emotion etc.
<br>Encourage emotion coaching
<br><br>
<br>Create shared meaning by making rituals of emotional connection intentional. 
<br>Create shared meanings by making goals and values intentional.

<br>Clarity and confidence about a direction for the marriage based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage, and each person's contributions to the problems. 


<br>Discernment counseling ends with a decision to take one of three paths:

<br>Couple therapy
<br>Divorce
<br>Status Quo


<br><br>
<br>Could be up to 30% of couples who come to therapy, but our models and techniques do not prepare us for these types of couples (one is leaning in the other leaning out).
<br>These types of couples are difficult to treat because of their conflicting goals for therapy. One to say it is worth investing in the relationship and we can fix the problems, the other perhaps to prove that we have done all we can it is time to split. 
<br>Doherty believed that before trying to do any sort of couple work, these couples needed to decide if that is what they wanted. 
<br><br>
<br>Short term processes: 1-5 sessions
<br>Goal is to get a deeper understanding of what has happened in the relationship and each partner's contributions to the problems. 
<br>Three paths:

<br>Status quo
<br>Divorce
<br>Therapy


<br><br>
<br>Couple together
<br>One spouse separately
<br>Summary to the other spouse
<br>One spouse separately
<br>Summary to the other spouse
<br>Couple together
<br><br>
<br>Not much research on <a data-href="Mixed-Agenda Couples" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a> couples and how to work with them. Most work suggests that <a data-href="Mixed-Agenda Couples" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a> couples are common (about 30%). Outcome research is sparse but suggest that these couples when treated with couple therapy are more likely to separate. 
<br>Also evidence that people going through the divorce process believe the marriage could be saved (about 26%) and are interested in reconciliation services (about 33%).
<br>Lots of evidence of ambivalence about the divorce and the relationship. 
<br>About 66.2% of folks in the divorce process were sure they wanted the divorce, 16.5% had mixed feelings, and 9.8% would consider reconciliation. 
<br>Conclusion:

<br>We need some way of providing services to folks considering divorce to help them with their mixed feelings and decide on a path. 


<br><br>
<br>100 cases evaluated

<br>97 heterosexual couples, 3 same-sex
<br>Married an average of 15.5 years
<br>Highly distressed based on the DAS short form
<br>51% had consulted a divorce attorney
<br>Well educated
<br>48% came based on self-referral, 34% from therapists or social service agencies, 11% from attorneys or judges. 


<br>Findings:

<br>Average number of sessions 3.61
<br>47% decided on path 3 (therapy), 41% separation/divorce, and 12% status quo. 
<br>Contact with a divorce attorney associated with a lower likelihood of path 3, and higher likelihood of path 2. 
<br>At follow-up, those who chose path 2:

<br>90% were divorced or in the process, one couple reconciled, and 3 were on hold. 


<br>Those who chose path 3:

<br>36% reconciled, 6% in process, 28% had divorced, 17% were in process of divorce, and 13% were on hold. 




<br><br>
<br>Ask what they understand about discernment counseling. 
<br>For the leaning-out partner:

<br>Make sure they feel heard and that they understand the process of discernment and that it is different than couple therapy then ask if they are still seeking some sort of clarity on the process of divorce, and how confident they are in their decision. 


<br>For the leaning-in partner:

<br>They recommend they read 'The Divorce Remedy by Michele Weiner-Davis', which provides advice for folks who have just found out their partner wants a divorce. 


<br>Recommended that you contact both partners separately for these intake conversations. 
<br><br>
<br>Block out 2 hours for the first session. 
<br>Meet together to ask questions, meet with each partner separately, provide summaries to the partners after each individual session, then come back together to summarize the set of sessions, therapist's impressions of the couple, then if both partners agree, schedule the second session. 
<br>Questions for both:

<br>What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility? Can you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?
<br>What role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?
<br>Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy?


<br>Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first):

<br>Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. 
<br>(Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. 
<br>Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)
<br>Ask them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. 
<br>Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement.  


<br>Now work with the leaning-in partner:

<br>Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. 
<br>Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. 
<br>Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. 
<br>Summary statement:

<br>Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. 


<br>Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. 

<br>What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. 
<br>Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. 




<br><br>
<br>Goals:

<br>Clarity
<br>Confidence
<br>More understanding


<br>90-minute sessions:

<br>Time together
<br>Time separately with summaries
<br>Time together wrap-up


<br>Check-in:

<br>3 goals:

<br>Learning where each partner is in their discernment process
<br>Reminding partners of the goals of discernment
<br>Acoiding an open-ended invitation to talk about the relationship problems. 




<br>Leaning-out partner:

<br>Move to help them see their contributions


<br>Leaning-In partner:

<br>Move to help them develop a plan for change


<br>Discernment is not the same for both partners, leaning in partner carries a bigger burden of leadership about what they may need to change in order for the marriage to be more viable. 
<br>Summaries should become more self-revealing and intense, therapist feedback can also be more in-depth in terms of positives and negatives. 
<br><br>
<br>Need to prepare partners for the work that will need to be done in therapy. 
<br>If you are going to be the couple therapist have a transition session possibly using the Agreement to Pursue Reconciliation Form (pg. 103). 
<br>Generate personal agendas for change (pg. 105) and have them share with each other. 
<br><br>
<br>Explore the divorce decision:

<br>Freedom
<br>Relief
<br>Painful letting go


<br>Deal with the emotional fall-out of the decision
<br>Prepare couple for a constructive divorce process in their interactions with each other, in their dealings with their children, and in choosing professional assistance. 
<br>Offer more sessions about a constructive divorce process. 
<br>Monitor the emotions and although emphasizing with each partner interrupt intense emotional outpourings from leaning-in partner, keep things as calm as possible. 
<br>In your summary, state any commonalities you have heard about their divorce hopes and dreams for their children, co-parenting, and their interest in mediation and collaborative divorce processes. 
<br><br>
<br>Why couples may choose this path:

<br>Leaning-out partner still can't decide and leaning-in partner is still leaning-in. 
<br>The couple may have gotten enough from the session (relief, able to talk more calmly about the issues, feel heard for the first time, etc.) so they feel ready to continue the relationship without more therapy. 
<br>It may also be it doesn't seem like the right time for a big change in their lives (considering their children or other situations).
<br>Some believe that situations that are impinging on their relationship might change so they decide to wait it out.

<br><br>
<br>It is probably more common to see couples who do not have diagnosable disorders but have complaints about the sexual aspects of their relationships. 
<br>The most common problem is desire discrepancy. 
<br>Some conditions are currently being considered for inclusion in the DSM:

<br>Sexual Compulsivity, Addition, or Hypersexuality
<br>Gender Non-Conformity (DSM-5 less restrictive, some things that would automatically mean a disorder are now only a disorder if there is distress or impairment around the activity)
<br>Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder (for females, unrelenting genital arousal that does not diminish with orgasm)
<br>Sexual Aversion Disorder (no longer listed as a sexual disorder, but as a phobia)
<br>Male Dyspareunia (men who had persistent pain with sexual activity; could be as simple as an infection, or more complex floor abnormalities).


<br><br>
<br>More comprehensive than talking about symptoms alone. Include the following:

<br>The couple's perception of the problem (s)
<br>Current baseline of individual and relational functioning
<br>Physical status of each partner
<br>The couple's expectations or goals for the treatment
<br>Realistic treatment goals
<br>Level of sexual desire of each partner
<br>Perceived degree of sexual satisfaction
<br>Level of distress experienced because of the sexual problem
<br>Impact on the intimate relationship
<br>The functions of sex in the relationship


<br>Get a sexual history from each partner (can be questionnaires or through interviewing, authors suggest conjoint interviewing to develop alliance and watch the process, they recommend flexible use of conjoint and individual sessions).
<br>Authors recommend that therapists understand their own sexual so that they can avoid inadvertently or overtly shaming. Use more open-ended questions and be careful about the words you use (i.e., have you been unfaithful? Vs. Do you have intimate relations with others in addition to your primary partner?)
<br>Adopt a stance of both never assuming and always assuming:

<br>Never assume a client's sexual orientation
<br>Always assume that everyone does everything
<br>Never assume that clients are educated about all aspects of sexuality


<br>Book provides lots of suggestions for how to ask questions to get at specific diagnoses and questions to ask when taking a sexual history. 
<br><br>
<br>Focus on gender, romantic love, attachment, intimacy, communication, gender orientation, and other themes associated with sexuality (provides questions to ask to complete the genogram)

<br>Beliefs about being a man or a woman
<br>Family patterns of relationships
<br>Couple relationship patterns (affairs, divorces, abandonment, loyalty and sacrifice)
<br>Family impact on current gender behavior
<br>Peer expectations
<br>Cultural expectations


<br><br>
<br>Assessment in sex therapy is essential for determining a treatment plan (like all therapy)
<br>There are formal assessment instruments but they were mostly designed for previous DSM versions, not the <a data-href="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-of-mental-disorders-(dsm).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</a> -5, they can still be used but may not be as useful for diagnosis. 
<br>Behavioral assessment (i.e., similar to BCT)
<br>Physiological measures (scores for respondent's perceptions of satisfaction with, or pain during phases of the sexual response cycle).
<br><br>
<br>Relationship issues vs. Sexual disorders (need to determine which is a priority for the couple)
<br>Thorough Assessment
<br>Collaborate on treatment planning
<br>Is the couple ready?
<br>When to start sex therapy and its techniques

<br>Weeks et al., (Chapters 1, 6-13, and 16)
<br>These techniques are not for the usual clients with sexual discrepancies (i.e., one client has a higher libido than the other). It is for individuals that struggle with sexual disorders/dysfunctions.
<br><br><br>
<br>Therapist directed or structured. 

<br>You can collaborate, but the therapist is not coming up with their own examples. 


<br>Related to practicing activities learned in sessions and other behaviors that are carefully crafted and explained during the session. 
<br>Expected to facilitate a therapeutic effect. 
<br>Need to be practical. 
<br>Practiced in small increments toward a goal (typically not erection, penetration, or orgasm). 
<br>Major goal is to reduce anxiety and reinforce new behavior. 
<br>Need to be relevant to the issues, and within the ability of the client or couple. 
<br>Make the assignment (perhaps in writing as well) and then work with the couple and what they think about the assignment, ay questions they have and any fears ,, they have about starting the assignment. 
<br>Collaborate so that the clients are invested and the assignment is tailored to them. 
<br>Negotiate the schedule, who initiates, and make sure they clearly understand what they are supposed to do. 
<br>Process the assignment the next session, what worked, what didn't, etc. Access effort. 
<br><br>
<br>Most effective evidence-based practices in combination with psychotherapy. For sex therapy, it includes information about sexual functioning, sexual disorders, sexual orientation, gender diversity, STI’s. 
<br>Comes in many forms (helps dispel myths, normalize, and inform)
<br>Bibliotherapy (books, internet-based material, TV shows, or other forms of media)

<br>Ensure to read, listen, and watch to the examples you will be giving to clients. 
<br>Need to gauge the clients' tastes and tolerance in using these resources. 


<br><br>
<br>Incorporates psychoeducation about the sexual response and a series of incremental physical exercises performed outside of the therapeutic setting. 
<br>Viewed as a form of desensitization intended to promote relaxation, communication and attention to physical sensations of touch, and the physical emotional connections between partners. 
<br>Combined with mindfulness (being present in the moment, not thinking about past or future; making no judgements, not spectating). Authors use a more systemic approach to sensate focus then originally designed. They include both partners, and create smaller increments of behaviors moving toward genital touch then Masters and Johnson. 
<br><br>
<br>9 functions of sensate focus:

<br>Become more aware of sensations
<br>Focus solely on one's own needs for pleasure
<br>Communicate sensual and sexual needs, wishes and desires
<br>Increase awareness of partner's sensual and sexual needs
<br>Expand the repertoire of intimate touch, sensual and sexual behaviors
<br>Learn to appreciate foreplay or touch as an end in itself rather than a means to an end
<br>Create positive relationship experiences
<br>Build sexual desire
<br>Enhance the level of love, caring, commitment, intimacy cooperation, and sexual interest in the relationship


<br><br>
<br>Describe what is involved, noting each partner's reaction (see questions on page 183)

<br>What is 'good enough' sex?


<br>Go slowly if one or both partners express hesitation or ambivalence or simple refusal. 
<br><br>
<br>Tailored to the specific needs of the couple. 
<br>The 'goal' of the exercise is the touch and the experience of the sensations, not erection, orgasm, penetration, etc.
<br>Specific assignments should occur weekly, so assignments can be reviewed and revised. Remind couples that this is a chance to rebuild physical and emotional intimacy and there is no hurry. 
<br>Couple is instructed to avoid intercourse and any activity that is sexual. The idea is to create a non-demand atmosphere. (reducing performance anxiety, increasing pleasurable encounters).
<br>Create a sensual environment. 
<br>Partners are both givers and receivers (regardless of the <a data-href="Identified Patient (IP)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/identified-patient-(ip).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Identified Patient (IP)</a>)
<br>Gradually build, first touch in general, no genital touch, with and without clothing to focus on sensations from touch, coach them to talk about what they like and what they want/need. During each session the giver listens to the receiver. The receiver progresses to being present (mindful) during the exercise only. 
<br>Review the assignment at the next session (questions on page 187)
<br>Once the couple is comfortable with nonsexual touch, move to erotic and genital touch, again in small increments. The goal is for the couple to experience sexual stimulation as a goal in itself. 
<br>If desired, then the couple can move to intercourse (no pressure). This can also be done in gradual steps. 

<br>Use exercises listed as examples for specific disorders. 


<br><br>
<br>Using the <a data-href="Miracle Question" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/miracle-question.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Miracle Question</a> to distill down the preferred narrative. 
<br>CBCT is a good example to help couples. Couples need to focus on emotions rather than logical thoughts that keep them stuck in their cycle. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Sexual Ignorance:

<br>Performance-based, goal-oriented model of normal is damaging to sexual intimacy. 


<br>Sexual Mythology:

<br>Misguided beliefs, misconceptions, and distortions that promote unrealistic standards and rigid expectations. 


<br>Faculty Cognitions:

<br>These can be engrained and automatic. They then can interfere with sexual desire, and limit a range of sexual behaviors (i.e., masturbation).


<br>Sexual guilt, anxiety, and shame
<br><br>
<br>Counter Faulty Beliefs

<br>Psychoeducation
<br>CBT Techniques


<br>Dealing with Intimacy Fears

<br>Underlying and unconscious fears of intimacy can complicate sex therapy (do couple work first)
<br>Distance regulation (fears of rejection/abandonment, dependency, anger, emotion, losing control).


<br><br>
<br>Sex therapists need to be collaborators with medical practitioners in the treatment of medically related sexual issues and cognitive disabilities

<br>Physical Illness:

<br>Sexual functioning involves many body systems. Thus, illness can impact sexual functioning. It is best to research the illness and what body systems are impacted by it (it is systemic) before deciding on a course of treatment. 
<br>Neurological Ailments (affect physical)

<br>Title: The Use of Emotionally Focused Therapy with Separated or Divorced Couples Le recours à la thérapie centrée sur l’émotion auprès des couples séparés ou divorcés, 
<br>Author: Allan, Robert;  
<br><br>Couples with children who are separated or divorced need to develop a plan for coparenting and the lifelong shared tasks of childrearing. While legally informed programs can offer mediation, these services can miss the underlying conflict that continues to plague postseparation couple relationships and, more importantly, their children. Divorce is a process with multiple transitions for a family, and the couples who separate or divorce may have a history of negative communication patterns that have long corroded their relationship. There is a need to develop a new coparenting relationship that can serve as a foundation for the long-term. The research literature varies in understanding the impact of divorce on children, but there is consistent agreement that parental conflict does affect child maladjustment. Emotionally focused therapy (EFT) is one effective means of working with a couple who are separated or divorced. EFT is an empirically supported couples’ treatment that was developed from attachment, emotion, and systems theories. This article explores the use of Stage 1 of EFT for couples who are separated or divorced, using a case example to further illustrate the model.<br><br>

<br><br>Gender-speciﬁc men-only interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) have had limited success beyond the effects of arrest alone. This review outlines current U.S. state-mandated treatments for IPV, acknowledges how conjoint treatment may better address a subtype of IPV that is not motivated by power and control, examines and reviews previously conducted couples-based treatments, and highlights policy implications and future directions. Empirical ﬁndings and theoretical support for the Duluth model, cognitive– behavioral approaches, and IPV typologies are presented, followed by a systematic review of selected quasi- and true experimental studies on couplesbased approaches for IPV. U.S. state guidelines that absolutely exclude conjoint approaches are overly restrictive, considering the poor evidence of effectiveness for current gender-speciﬁc groups. Further, the theoretical foundations of most men-only groups assume unilateral, male-to-female violence, which does not ﬁt at least one-third of court-involved cases and leaves treatment needs of couples experiencing problematic relationship dynamics unmet. For a carefully screened subset of couples that experience predominantly “situational violence,” conjoint communication and relationship skills training groups may be a viable alternative to the Duluth model and cognitive–behavioral men-only groups.<br><br>

<br>"Some U.S. state guidelines are so restrictive that they appear to prohibit anything except a Duluth model intervention." (p. 109)

<br>"No true experiments have found the Duluth model to be effective." (pg. 109)


<br>"The intervention piece of the Duluth model has minimal impact on reducing recidivism over and above the effect of arrest and probation alone." (p. 110)
<br>"Psychologists tried to improve men's group outcomes by incorporating cognitive-behavioral techniques known to be effective in treating other externalizing behaviors, including anger and substance abuse issues." (p. 110)

<br>"The outcome statistics on these cognitive-behavioral men-only groups are disappointing, comparable with those of the Duluth model men's group." (p. 110)


<br>"No single current battering intervention modality outperforms any other and there is room for improvement in adequately reducing IPV recidivism." (p. 110)
<br>Primary Goal of Journal Article:

<br>"The primary aim of this review is to introduce the potential utility of conjoint intervention as an alternative approach to both Duluth model and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions for a certain subset of intimate partner abusers."
<br>"Reviewed studies included treatment conditions in which both members of a couple experiencing IPV were involved in direct intervention and follow-up measures obtained from a combination of victims only, both victims and perpetrators or conviction reports."


<br><br>
<br>"Beginning in the 1980s, the Duluth model men’s groups were implemented as a deferred-adjudication intervention, prompted by judges so that the influx of new arrests for IPV did not overwhelm jails and prisons." (p. 110)
<br>"The Duluth model was based on ideology and field-based interviewing rather than scientific testing." (p. 110)
<br>"The Duluth model creators developed the “power and control wheel,” which conceptualizes IPV as one form of abuse to maintain male privilege." (p. 110)<br>
<img alt="Duluth Power and Control Wheel.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/duluth-power-and-control-wheel.png">
<br>The primary objective is to abandon authoritarian relationships and achieve effective forms of behavior that fall on the “equality wheel,” which fosters an egalitarian mindset within relationships. In this model, re-educating men is the goal." (p. 111)
<br>"This model focuses predominantly on maladaptive beliefs held by men regarding women, IPV, and gender stereotypes." (p. 111)
<br>"The Duluth model curriculum posits that the mechanism of change is replacing maladaptive attitudes held by men. Besides using the “<a data-href="Time-Out" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/time-out.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Time-Out</a>” technique, it does not provide strategies for functional changes in relationship dynamics." (p. 111)
<br><br>
<br>"Like the Duluth model intervention, cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions are also typically administered to men in a group setting." (p. 111)
<br>"Treatment places the importance of examining and eliminating violent behavior at the forefront." (p. 111)
<br>"Violence is considered to be learned behavior and must in turn be replaced by learned nonviolent behavior. Similarly to the Duluth model intervention, this type of intervention seeks to rehabilitate the sole perpetrator of the IPV." (p. 111)
<br>"Cognitive–behavioral interventions for IPV outline the functionality of violent behavior, explore the pros and cons of using violence to solve problems, and propose alternative solutions for dealing with antecedents of violence." (p. 111)

<br>"These strategies include cognitive restructuring of negative attributions, anger management techniques, and resocialization." (p. 111)
<br>"Unlike the Duluth model, cognitive– behavioral interventions adopt an explicit therapeutic rather than psychoeducational stance in an effort to reduce violent behavior." (p. 111)


<br>Although there is a proliferation of typologies of IPV perpetrators, rarely is intervention tailored to the needs of specific types of perpetrators. (p. 111)
<br>Survey data from a national longitudinal sample suggested reciprocal or bilateral violence, with both partners perpetuating violence against each other, occurs in 50% of U.S. couples reporting IPV, while another study suggested that the rate of couples experiencing bidirectional violence is as high as 60%. (p. 112)
<br>Treatment approaches that assume unilateral, male-to-female violence may not address a significant portion of the types of problems that couples present with when seeking treatment. (p. 112)
<br><br>
<br>First called Patriarchal Terrorism then to Intimate Partner Terrorism and then to Coercive Controlling Violence

<br>Patriarchal terrorism exemplifies men’s systematic use of control tactics against women, which can include violence but also economic subordination, isolation, and threats. (p. 112)
<br>Both men and women can perpetuate. (p. 112)
<br>This involves severe forms of severe forms of violence with a goal of dominating or controlling one's partner, and is often fueled by positive attitudes about violence in general. (p. 112)
<br>Coercive controlling violence is also a hallmark feature of the later coined term 'characterological violence.' (p. 112)

<br>A perpetrator of predominantly characterological violence is likely to be violent in all intimate relationships. (p. 112)




<br>Common Couple Violence (to Situational Couple Violence)

<br>Common couple violence was created to serve as a gender-neutral term, and is thought to result from relationship conflict that leads to violence, rather than patriarchic motivations related to control. (p. 112)
<br>Common couple violence, a label that potentially minimized the seriousness of the problem, was changed to situational couple violence. (p. 112)
<br>Situational violence includes behavior such as pushing, grabbing, and slapping, and typically occurs with lower frequency. This type of violence is not motivated by underlying desires to dominate and control one’s partner, but rather occurs as a result of situational stressors within a relationship that are repeatedly remedied by using violence as a problem-solving strategy. (p. 112)
<br>The manifestation of recurring, bilateral IPV is usually sustained by interactive and dyadic factors, such as distorted emotions, thoughts, and beliefs among intimate partners. Such factors contribute to relationship dysfunction associated with bilateral IPV, and situational violence is its most common form. (p. 112)
<br>For couples that experience situational violence, the violence may stop when partners enter new relationships with less volatile partners. (p. 112)
<br>Characterological violence is characterized by a pathological desire for power and control, but even levels of coercive control may fall on a continuum. (p. 112)


<br>Appropriateness for conjoint treatment will vary depending on levels of coercive violence, and whether characterological or situational features dominate the overall picture of violence. (p. 113)

<br>Female victims of violence who had participated in conjoint therapy said that they often felt intimated or afraid in therapy and refrained from sharing these feelings with their therapists. (p. 113)
<br>Victim blaming is always a possibility in the context of court-mandated interventions. Men sent to jail or to any type of mandated intervention often blame their female partners for putting them in such a situation. (p. 113)
<br>Placing partner-violent men in a group setting can in actuality offer justification from other group members that beliefs about using violence in intimate partner relationships is acceptable. (p. 113)
<br><br>
<br>Failure to address dyadic conflict that occurs in relationships may contribute to further perpetration of violence, instead of protect individuals from it. (p. 113)
<br>To date, eight studies have tested couples approaches for addressing IPV. (p. 113)

<br>One study concluded that conjoint interventions for IPV can be used safely, at least if they are used in conjunction with probation, and especially for couples with alcohol problems. (p. 113)
<br>Results from two studies showed that BCT lowered IPV in alcoholic men from 60% to 24% for men who continued to drink following treatment and to 12% for men who abstained from alcohol following treatment. (p. 114)


<br>Women who were victims of intimate terrorism/characterological violence would not—and should not—attend conjoint groups.
<br><br>
<br>To carefully and systematically designate which couples would be appropriate for conjoint treatment, researchers have created and validated the Situational Violence Screening Tool (SVST). (p. 118)

<br>Both men and women are interviewed to rule out controlling behavior, fear, severe abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, and antisocial and borderline personality disorder features. (p. 118)


<br>Validated screening tools are a critical first step for identifying situationally violent couples for whom conjoint interventions may be particularly effective. (p. 118)
<br>Creating Healthy Relationships Program (CHRP)

<br>The CHRP is a 22-week multi-couple group program that focuses primarily on skills including effective conflict management and creating a shared meaning within the relationship. This program is based on the sound relationship house theory, which emphasizes factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction and longevity in committed relationships.

<br><br>This article describes discernment counseling, an approach to working with couples where one partner is leaning toward divorce and the other wants to preserve the relationship and work on it in couples therapy. These “mixed‐agenda” couples are common in clinical practice but have been neglected in the literature. The goal of discernment counseling is clarity and confidence regarding the next steps for the relationship, based on a deeper understanding of each partner's contributions. Sessions emphasize individual conversations with each partner. An analysis of 100 consecutive cases found that about half of the couples chose to start couples therapy in order to reconcile, with most of the rest choosing the divorce path. Longer term follow‐up information is also presented.<br><br>

<br><br>Emotionally focused couple therapy (EFT) is an empirically validated attachment based approach to couple therapy. From an EFT perspective, sexual functioning is viewed within the context of an attachment bond, but sexual satisfaction in EFT has not been empirically tested. We examined self-reported sexual satisfaction across 24 months in a sample of 32 couples who received an average of 21 EFT sessions. We found that sexual satisfaction increased across six time points from pre to post therapy and across follow-up (6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and that decreases in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy predicted increases in sexual satisfaction across time. These findings provide evidence that EFT may help couples improve their sexual satisfaction by reducing attachment avoidance in therapy.<br><br>

<br>“While happy couples attribute 15–20% of their happiness in the relationship to a satisfying sex life, couples in distressed relationships attribute 50–70% of their distress to sexual problems” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 1) (Potential Question: With your couples at the clinic, do you often discuss the role of sex in the relationship? How comfortable do you feel discussing about the role of sex between the clients? (Maybe on a scale of 1-10))

<br>“couples EFT resulted in improved sexual desire and a decrease in depressive symptoms” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)
<br>“The goal of the current study is to examine self-reported sexual satisfaction, attachment anxiety and avoidance, and relationship satisfaction among couples receiving EFT and across 2 years after therapy has ended.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)

<br>“Sex is a way for couples to express affection, explore and experience intimacy, satisfy desire, lessen tension, restore connection after conflict, and shape personal and relational meaning” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)
<br>“Sexual interest and arousal tend to foster interest in forming and maintaining close relationships, including increased self-disclosure, intimacy related thoughts, willingness to make sacrifices for a romantic partner, and greater wanting to resolve conflict in positive ways” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)

<br>“Marital dissatisfaction and ongoing unresolved conflict may also be barriers to quality sexual experiences” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)


<br>“Sexual functioning and relationship functioning are inextricably linked and bidirectionally influential in couple relationships” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)<br>“higher levels of relationship satisfaction at one assessment wave predicted more positive changes in sexual satisfaction from that assessment wave to the next and vice versa” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)<br>“changes in sexual satisfaction correlated with changes in relationship quality, and that declines in sexual satisfaction were associated with increased divorce probability. Furthermore, sexual satisfaction predicts greater emotional intimacy in romantic relationships” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)<br>“Therapies for treating men with sexual dysfunction also seem to be most effective when they include relational concerns and attention to the interpersonal difficulties expressed” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 2)<br>“Attachment theory asserts that a securely attached partner in a relationship would be more confident and comfortable with his or her partner during moments of sex and intimacy, and better able to deal collaboratively with differences in preferences and desire” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“Optimally secure sex can be conceptualized as examples of effective interdependence in which both partners’ needs are attended to, resulting in mutual satisfaction” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“Individuals with secure attachment styles also seem to be notably more effective at emotion regulation” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“A secure attachment style is associated with greater flexible adaptation to new situations and exploration of novel environments” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“insecure attachment styles have been linked with fewer positive sexual feelings and more negative ones across multiple studies” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“There are two main styles of attachment insecurity that are typically measured on two dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. High levels of attachment anxiety involve worrying about the availability of close others, whereas high levels of attachment avoidance involve an inflated sense of independence and denial of attachment needs” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“Individuals high on attachment anxiety were reported to emphasize emotional dissatisfactions that occurred during sex, whereas individuals high on attachment avoidance were more likely to describe the physical aspects of sex that were dissatisfying” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“those with high attachment anxiety tend to use sex more readily as a tool for determining the status of” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 3)<br>“sex for anxiously attached individuals was more likely to increase emotional appraisals (such as feeling loved), be used to sustain a relationship (thus avoiding abandonment), or be used as a way to coax a partner’s love and affection” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“Partners with high attachment anxiety generally weigh these daily relational and sexual events more heavily in their view of the relationship than do securely attached partners” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“Higher levels of attachment anxiety are associated with having sex to reduce insecurity or facilitate closeness in a relationship” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“Individuals with high attachment avoidance have been found to have sex as a means to bolster personal opinions of themselves (attractiveness etc.) and incur bragging rights” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“Those individuals also more readily rely on self-pleasing mechanisms, including higher levels of masturbation and increased levels of fantasizing about persons other than their partner” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“individuals high in attachment avoidance generally are less likely to engage in sex for the formation and promotion of relational closeness or emotional connectedness. Sexual interactions in this way are typified by less intimate copulatory positions, and a less positive view of affectionate behaviors such as kissing, cuddling, and so on” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“highly avoidant individuals are more likely to engage in sex to maximize control and dominance and avoid closeness and emotional accessibility” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“highly avoidant individuals tend to limit the level of emotional intimacy in sexual encounters” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with a greater tendency to perceive that their partner controls sex in the relationship and that the sexual outcome is dependent primarily on situational contributions and factors” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“those with insecure attachment styles also have much stronger concerns about their sexual performance and are less willing to experiment sexually with their partner” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“insecure partners also are more likely to report problems in sexual communication” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“EFT” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“conceptualizes relationship distress as the result of an insecure attachment” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 4)<br>“bond” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“EFT is effective in helping couples create more secure attachment bonds that last over the years following completion of therapy” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“EFT is carried out in three stages. The first stage, cycle deescalation, involves helping couples gain an understanding of their negative cycle of conflict, particularly underlying attachment needs and fears. The second stage of EFT, restructuring attachment interactions, involves helping couples explore and express to one another their attachment needs and emotions. The third stage, consolidation and integration, involves helping the two people bring their new understanding of one another and the relationship into their everyday lives as they strive to resolve sources of conflict and areas of concern.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“a secure attachment style has been found to be associated with positive feelings, trust, and greater relationship satisfaction in relationships” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“Those with a secure attachment style are more likely to be able to assert their need for support to their partner” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“Secure attachment also extends to how a person approaches emotional risk taking, which results in greater ability to provide emotional support for others” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“attachment theory, attachment styles develop in the context of relationships and impact ways of being in those relationships. In EFT, therapists help couples create a secure attachment bond in the specific couple relationships through the use of experiential and systemic interventions to help partners explore and express attachment-related emotions and needs to one another and foster empathic responding in structured conversations” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“EFT can help couples improve their sexual relationships, which begins with viewing the couple’s sexual relationship from an attachment lens” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“the EFT therapist is able to recognize and account for the power of sexual responses in defining the quality of the love relationship, thus working with the couple to specifically address the difficulties in their sex life as a part of repairing the relationship.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>“proponents of EFT propose three kinds of sex: “sealed-off sex,” “solace sex,” and “synchrony sex”” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>““Sealed-off sex” involves pleasure seeking without attention to the relationship, a tendency of more avoidant partners.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 5)<br>““solace sex” is characterized by seeking sex as a way of soothing anxieties or insecurities in the relationship, as is common among more anxiously attached partners” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)<br>““Synchrony sex,” from an EFT perspective, is characteristic of attachment security and involves a focus on the relationship and sexual pleasure, bringing the two together” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)<br>“This kind of sex involves seeking new experiences, feeling safe enough to ask for one’s sexual needs to be met, and responding to one’s partner’s needs in an attuned way” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)<br>“The current study is an examination of sexual satisfaction among couples who receive EFT.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 6)<br>“we map the trajectory of sexual satisfaction at pretherapy, posttherapy, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months follow-up.

We also found that reductions in attachment avoidance from pre to post therapy significantly predicted higher sexual satisfaction across time points, suggesting that reductions in attachment avoidance (as facilitated through EFT) may be an important factor toward improving sexual satisfaction for couples over the long term. These results also suggest that attachment avoidance may play a significant role in the sexual relationship of distressed couples, and may have value as a target of change to improve sexual satisfaction for these couples.” (Wiebe et al., 2019, p. 17)]]></description><link>https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/couples-(hdfs-8876)/readings/@wiebeattachmentchangeemotionally2019.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">University Resources/HDFS/Couple and Family Therapy/Couples (HDFS 8876)/Readings/@wiebeAttachmentChangeEmotionally2019.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 09:53:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Helping couples on the brink of divorce: Discernment counseling for troubled relationships.]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Clinical presentation that may account for up to 30% of couples in clinical practice. 
<br>These are couples in which one spouse is seriously considering divorce and is reluctant to try couples therapy (but does show up for the first session) while the other spouse wants to preserve the marriage and is eager to start couples therapy. 

<br>We refer to the first spouse as leaning-out and the second as leaning in.




<br><a data-href="Discernment Counseling" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/discernment-counseling.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Discernment Counseling</a> creates a holding environment for the couple to develop clarity and confidence in deciding on the next step for their relationship, whether it is divorce or a shared commitment to couples therapy to repair the relationship. 
<br><br>
<br>Proceeding with standard couple assessment and intervention risks alienating the leaning-out spouse who is resistant or ambivalent about doing therapy. Holding back from starting couples therapy risks alienating the leaning-in partner who is ready to go and may be desperate to stabilize a rocky marriage. 
<br>Sometimes the divergent goals do not become clear until near the end of the first session after the therapist has done an initial assessment and outlined a provisional treatment plan. 
<br>The therapist may fall into one of two traps:

<br>Trying to talk the leaning-out spouse into trying therapy for a number of sessions. 

<br>This can put you into an alliance with the leaning-in spouse who may have been insisting they try couples therapy. 
<br>In doing so, you risk pursuing the distancer, a strategy that works poorly in marriage and therapy. 
<br>Sometimes the leaning-out spouse reluctantly goes along with, say, a contract for 3 months of couples therapy as an experiment to see whether things can change. But typically this spouse is not invested personally in the therapy; the burden falls on the leaning-in spouse to start making meaningful changes that will satisfy the other partner's desire to see progress. The therapy starts out unbalanced, with one customer or change agent and one observer or evaluator. 
<br>Although trying to persuade an ambivalent spouse to try couples therapy is better than giving up on the marriage, it carries two risks that discernment counseling aims to avoid: allying with one partner and starting half-hearted couples therapy. 


<br>Witholding any intervention plan until the couple is clear about their goals.

<br>Although they may believe this is a neutral stance, it ends up siding with the leaning-out spouse by offering nothing to deal with the impasse presented by competing agendas - in effect, saying to the leaning-in partner, "I can't help you with your marriage unless your spouse agrees to try."
<br>Another version of giving up is to try to get the leaning-in spouse to hear the reluctance of the other partner to stay in the marriage and then to accept the inevitability of divorce. 
<br>Either way, the therapist distances themselves from the couple's dilemma by offering no meaningful way to deal with their differences over where to take the relationship. 


<br>Some therapists work with mixed-agenda couples by offering several conjoint assessment sessions before making a decision on therapy or divorce.

<br>This approach is not in the category of a trap (because it does not create an alliance with one spouse), but it does involve the tactical mistake of seeing both spouses together in the room for this assessment and consensus building. 
<br>The central problem is that this approach misses the reality that the decision to stay or leave is first an individual one, a personal choice made by each partner. 

<br>The decision is best pursued in individual conversations with the therapist (the discernment counseling approach) rather than in conjoint sessions in which there is likely to be pressure to conform or resist. Having both spouses in the room for open-ended exploration invites the partners to share everything the think and feel in front of each other - a risky proposition in the face of possible rejection and divorce. 


<br>Doing pre-therapy assessment primarily with both partners together in the room often leads to either painful disclosures with little immediate chance for healing because there is no contract for therapy, or to withholding and playing safe, which can lead to paralysis, after which someone announces that therapy is not working. 




<br><br>
<br>The discernment counseling protocol was inspired by <a data-href="Betty Carter" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Betty Carter" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Betty Carter</a>, who developed (but never published) an original way to work with mixed-agenda couples. 

<br>There are two key insights. 

<br>The first was that couples who are divided on whether to stay together bring such different needs and agendas to couples therapy that they should each be worked with separately, in individual conversations. The therapist helps the leaning-out spouse make a decision on whether to divorce or stay and work on the marriage. The therapist helps the leaning-in spouse bring their best self forward to try to save the marriage. 
<br>The second key insight was that both spouses can tolerate knowing that the therapist is helping the other with a different, and seemingly competing, agenda. 




<br>Discernment counseling became something more formal and public beginning in 2008, with Doherty and Bruce Peterson, a family court judge who was interesting in how many couples in the divorce process were open to reconciliation. 

<br>Judge Peterson used two analogies:

<br>Filing for divorce is like getting on a superhighway with no exit ramps or rest stops, and it is also like having a trap door open and falling down a chute that leads to only one destination. 
<br>Findings found that 30% of spouses in the divorce process (measured at the individual level) expressed interest in reconciliation services, and in 10% of couples, both partners independently expressed that interest. 




<br>Discernment counseling was the term coined because the goal was for couples to work through the complexities of their situation and decide on a future direction for their marriage. (the term counseling is used deliberately to distinguish the approach from what people think of as problem-solving, relationship-improving couples therapy).
<br><br>
<br>Discernment counseling is a short-term process (one to five sessions) with the goal of greater clarity and confidence in the decision about a direction for the marriage, based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and each partner's contribution to the problems. 

<br>It is not intended for cases in which one partner has made a final decision to divorce and simply wants a venue to convince their spouse to accept the decision. 

<br>The immediate decision is whether to carve out a 6-month period of all-out effort in couples therapy to restore the marriage to health, with divorce off the table during that time. At the end of 6 months, they can reopen the decision about divorce on the basis of what they have learned about the prospect of successfully rebuilding their marriage. 


<br>Therapy aims for improvement in the relationship (e.g., increased intimacy, decreased toxic conflict), whereas discernment counseling aims for clarity and confidence about a next step. The goal of discernment counseling is not to solve marriage problems but to see whether they can be solved.
<br>There is no relationship homework for couples in discernment counseling, no teaching of skills during sessions, and no enactments of deeper ways to connect.
<br>If clients ask for ways to manage their problems during discernment counseling, we use a 'restraint from change' approach by reminding them that relationship change should not be expected during discernment counseling. 


<br>Path 1:

<br>The marraige as it has been: the status quo, neither divorce nor working in therapy to improve the relationship. 


<br>Path 2:

<br>Separation or divorce


<br>Path 3:

<br>A 6-month commitment to couples therapy (and sometimes other forms of help, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, or individual therapy) with divorce off the table and with the possibility of putting divorce back on the table at the end of the 6 months. 
<br>The idea behind path 3 is to move beyond amibalence about working on change and see whether it is possible to put the marriage into a place that would be good for both partners.
<br>Path 3, as we emphasize repeatedly, involves each partner developing a personal agenda for change on the basis of a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and their role in the problems. 


<br>An advantage of framing the immediate outcomes as paths is that it moves clients past the dichotomous choice between staying together or breaking-up. 

<br>The therapist too can support the idea that something has to change - the marriage cannot continue as it has been. So sometimes the discernment process begins with agreements instead of disagreement - something has to change; the old ways of being married is no longer viable. 
<br>Implicitly we are saying that divorce is not a failure in this process; it is simply one of the options to be explored in a serious way, even thought only one spouse is actively considering it. 
<br>Sometimes it has taken years to build up the courage to put divorce on the table in a chronically distressed marriage. Path 3 avoids the 'in or out' conundrum by offering a provisional commitment to work hard on the relationship for a period, with divorce not an option for this period but something that can be revisited later if things do not change enough. 


<br>Most of the work occurs in separate conversations with each spouse, with carefully orchestrated sharing of take-home messages from the individual conversations. 

<br>The flow of the sessions goes this way:

<br>Time with the couple together
<br>Meeting with one spouse alone (the other goes to the waiting room)
<br>The other spouse returns and the first spouse summarizes key learning from the individual conversation 
<br>Meeting with the second spouse alone
<br>The second spouse shares learning from that conversation 
<br>A check out with both spouses during which time the therapist shares reflections on the process thus far. 


<br>The majority of the time is with each partner alone. 
<br>Times when both parties are together in the room are carfully orchestrated to minimize demoralizing exchanges and to maximize the focus on what each is learning about themselves in the process, rather than what each wants the other to change. 
<br>The individual conversations have both similar and different areas of focus for the leaning-in and leaning-out partners. similar themes are helping each better understand the dynamics of the relationship (their relational dance), their individual contributions to the problems, and how these relational and personal issues could be addressed in couples therapy (and sometimes with other helping resources). In terms of different themes, the therapist helps the leaning-out spouse figure out which path to take on the basis of an exploration of the sources of the person’s pain and discouragement about the prospect of change. The focus is on making a decision that has integrity for one’s self and others on the basis of a deeper understanding of self and the marriage and how the problems could be addressed in couples therapy if that is the chosen direction. 
<br>The limit of five sessions, although not immutable, creates an expectation of intense work within a limited time frame. 

<br>Going on much longer also makes it difficult for the couple not to expect relationship change and for the therapist to not lapse into doing couple interventions.
<br>We say one to five sessions and not five sessions because clients are asked each time about whether they want to do an additional session up to five.




<br>some people are emotionally flat when their spouse is in the room and then liven up when our one-to-one time begins.
<br><br>
<br>There has been strikingly little clinical literature on how to work with these couples. 
<br>One study recommended slowing down the decision-making process about divorce and then negotiating for a number of therapy sessions. 
<br>No research study offered a detailed protocol for working with mixed-agenda couples or an evaluation of the approach the author used. 
<br><br>
<br>A big part of this approach is helping clients see the difference between traditional marital therapy and discernment counseling and allowing them to indicate their willingness to engage in the process.
<br>We are also interested in knowing exactly what the couple knows about <a data-href="Discernment Counseling" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/discernment-counseling.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Discernment Counseling</a> and what they hope to get out of a discernment counseling experience. 

<br>The clients must leave the conversation with an understanding that the goal for discernment counseling is to help them gain greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage. 
<br>If your practice has a website, include a page describing discernment counseling so potential clients can educate and even screen themselves before calling to set up the first appointment. 


<br><br>
<br>We pay specific attention to whether they are currently living together and the status of any legal proceedings associated with divorce, including whether anyone has consulted with a lawyer. If so, do they have the lawyers on retainer, and how far along are they in the legal divorce process?
<br>After collecting some basic information over the phone, we typically ask something such as, "Can you tell me a bit about your current situation and how do you think it might be helpful to your situation?"

<br>It is recommended to ask them how they heard of discernment counseling. Knowing this source may also provide clues about how far into the formal divorce process they are. 


<br><br>
<br>We listen specifically for which member of the couple is leaning-out of the relationship. Leaning-out partners often play a key role in determining whether couples come in at all for a first session. 
<br>It is important that leaning-out partners feel heard and that they understand how this process is different from anything they have tried as a couple before. It is also important to assess whether leaning-out partners have made a decision to divorce or are open to the work of discernment. The following questions can be helpful in determining this:

<br>"Would you say that you've made your decision about the future of your marriage or are you still seeking some level of clarity in this process?"
<br>If they report that they have made a decision, you can ask about their level of confidence in the decision: "How confident are you that you're making the right decision?"


<br>Those who call you will still be seeking some level of clarity in their decision making. They may say they are 'pretty sure' they want a divorce but feel they need to go through this process just to be 'sure,' or they may feel they 'owe it to' their partner, their marriage, or even their children. Both of these situations represent an appropriate use of the discernment counseling model. 
<br>For those leaning-out partners who indicate they know they want a divorce and would like to use the session to 'break the news' to their partner, or for those who say they do not know how to tell their partner, you can inform them that this is not consistent with the goals of discernment counseling. You might respond in the following manner:

<br>"It may be that discernment counseling is not exactly a good fit for what you want to do. The goals of discernment counseling are to help people get a greater sense of clarity and confidence in their decision making about a direction for the future of their marriage based on a better understanding of what happened to the marriage to get it to the brink of divorce and each person's role in that. If you're hoping for a different outcome, like helping your spouse understand why you want a divorce, discernment counseling is not appropriate for your situation."


<br>For those who ultimately want to help to annouce their divorce intentions, you can point them to other services such as divorce mediation or 'closure counseling.'
<br><br>
<br>When talking with the leaning-in partner at the intake, you should gather their perspective on the current situation in the marriage. 

<br>Usually, the leaning-in partner makes it clear that they want to preserve the marriage, but if not, ask that question directly. Often the leaning-in partner is desperate to do something, anything, to save the marriage. 
<br>In these situations, you can suggest that they purchase and begin reading Michele Weiner-Davis's (2002) book, The Divorce Remedy.

<br>They learn that they must first look at themselves and their own behavior before the marriage can get to a healthier place. You might use the following language to make this recommendation:

<br>"Her book is written specifically for people who have recently found out that their spouse is considering divorce. She gives some practical advice on how you can act toward your partner at this stage of the process. There are probably things you can be working on that will make the situation somewhat better without making your partner feel as though he or she is committing to working on the relationship. This approach may be your best option at the moment."






<br>We cannot emphasize enough the value of respecting client autonomy during this process. Never assume that both parties are equally interested in attending discernment counseling. 

<br>Discernment counseling is a way of meeting both parties where they are and not privileging one person's agenda over the other. 

<br>"It is really important that your spouse feel as though they have a choice in whether to come to discernment counseling. If he or she feels forced into it, it won't go well and will likely contribute to more estrangement from you on their part. "




<br>Never assume that because one spouse has told you about something that has been happening in the relationship, the other spouse knows about it. 
<br><br>
<br>The intake conversation must be conducted one on one, without the person's partner or anyone else in the room. The person on the intake phone call has to be able to speak freely about their perspective on the problems they are having and the struggles they are experiencing making a decision regarding the future of their marriage. 

<br>"Are you in a place that you can speak freely without interruptions?"


<br>If there is noise or other distractions, you may want to suggest a different time or place for the call. You also should ascertain whether the client has told their spouse about discernment counseling. 

<br>"Have you discussed discernment counseling with your spouse? What do you think is his or her level of interest in participating? Does your spouse know that you and I are speaking today?"


<br>Avoid the temptation to speak to one partner right after the other for the sake of convenience. It is probably worth taking the time at the phone intake to ensure that no one is feeling forced into having this conversation. 
<br>There is also benefit to suggesting that the first partner you speak with explain to their partner that they have spoken with a discernment counselor and that if the spouse is interested, they can e-mail or phone the counselor to set up an interview. 

<br>In no case should you cold call the other partner, who may not be aware of the initial contact from the spouse. 
<br>Consider using the following script as a guide to the initiator of the phone call:

<br>"It sounds like discernment counseling is appropriate for your situation according to what you've told me. The next step is for your partner and me to chat about their take on the situation and whether they are interested in discernment counseling. What might be a good idea for you is to tell your partner that we talked today, and point her to the website that describes discernment counseling. Further, you can tell them that if they are interested in doing this work, they can contact me directly and we can have a similar conversation to the one you and I just had. What is important here is that no one feels coerced to be part of this process. By putting the ball squarely in their court, they can demonstrate their willingness to do discernment counseling by initiating the call. "


<br>Respect the autonomy of each person to engage in this process at their own pace. 


<br><br>
<br>The phone intake is to describe, in sufficient detail, the purpose, goals, and process of discernment counseling. This overview helps ensure that you and the clients are on the same page with regard to expectation. 

<br>It is important to point out how discernment counseling is different from marital therapy. The following is some language you can use:

<br>"The goal of discernment is to help couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage based on a deeper understanding of the problems in the marriage and each person's contributions to them. "
<br>"Discernment counseling is typically a brief counseling modality and could last anywhere between one and five sessions. There is no need to commit to all five sessions because each of you would only commit to attending one session at a time. "
<br>"The format of the sessions consists of meeting as a couple with the counselor as well as having some time dedicated to one-on-one work with the counselor. After each one-on-one portion of the session, each partner will summarize what he or she is 'taking with them' from the time with the counselor and share it with the partner who was waiting outside the room. The first session is 2 hours, and subsequent sessions are an hour and a half each. "
<br>"In discernment counseling, we discuss the paths that are before every couple on the brink of divorce. Path 1 we call the status quo path and represents your relationship continuing the way it current is. Path 2 represents the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the possible reconciliation path, in which the couple agrees to take divorce off the table for a 6-month period of couples therapy, and each one commits to work on the relationship to see whether they can get the relationship to a healthier place. These three paths frame the discussions we have in discernment counseling."
<br>"Discernment counseling is different from typical marriage counseling. The goal is not to solve your problems but to help you decide whether to try to solve your problems or choose a different path. It's not about immediate change in your relationship but seeing what changes each of you might need to make in the future if you decide to work on yourselves and your marriage."
<br>Finally, you can end this portion of the phone intake by asking how this process sounds to them and whether they are still interested on the basis of what you have discussed: "Does this sound like a process that might hold some value for you in your current situation?"




<br><br>
<br>We screen for safety and whether the couple has a history or any current experiences with intimate partner violence (IPV). What we are mostly concerned with is whether one of the partners is feeling coerced to participate and whether participating in discernment counseling will put one of the partners at risk of IPV. 

<br>"We want to make sure everyone who pariticpates in discernment counseling does so voluntarily and that no one is put at risk. So I have a few questions that we ask everyone who contacts us for an appointment. 

<br>Are you feeling pressured by your spouse to participate in this project? Yes / No. 

<br>If yes, does the pressure seem coercive (for example, is it accompanied by threats with personal or legal ramifications)? Yes / No


<br>Have you or your spouse ever had an order of protection from a court? Yes / No

<br>If yes, who?




<br>My last questions are about what happens when you and your partner get into arguments or fights. Again, our goal is to make sure everyone is safe. 

<br>Has your partner ever done something to you out of anger that has caused you physical pain, bruises, or bodily injury? Yes / No (If yes, get specifics) 
<br>Do you ever feel afraid of your spouse? Yes / No

<br>If yes, are you in danger now? Yes / No


<br>If yes to either, I can help you talk to someone at an agency that can help you. Would you like me to give you that information? In an emergency, urge the person to call 911. Ask if you can call back to check on the person. 




<br>After having screened for safety and seeing no red flags, the individual on the phone is told that they seem to be an appropriate candidate for discernment counseling. Remember, it is not enough to just ask one partner these questions; both spouses have to be screened for this assessment to have validity. 
<br><br>
<br>We recommend that all couples therapy telephone intakes include an assessment or screening for <a data-href="Mixed-Agenda Couples" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a>. By adding the following questions to an agency phone intake protocol, you can reduce the chances of unintentionally assigning a <a data-href="Mixed-Agenda Couples" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a> to traditional couples therapy. 

<br>“Leaning In or Out Measure.png” could not be found.


<br><br>
<br>Respecting autonomy and confidentiality is also a primary goal of the intake process. 
<br>When intakes are correctly conducted, each spouse should feel heard and respected and believe that the discernment counseling process has something to offer each of them, regardless of their leaning-in or leaning-out status. 
<br><br>
<br>We strongly recommend a 2-hour block of time because of the amount of ground to be covered in the session. After both partners' perspectives are heard in response to a series of questions, the discernment counselor meets one-on-one with both members of the couple, and each briefly shares what he or she learned in the individual conversations. The session ends with the couple in the room together for a summary of the work that was done that day and any impressions the discernment counselor has to share. If both spouses agree, the second discernment counseling session is then scheduled. 
<br><br>
<br>With <a data-href="Mixed-Agenda Couples" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/couples/key-terms-and-concepts/mixed-agenda-couples.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mixed-Agenda Couples</a>, neither is much in touch specifically with their partner’s perspective, and often their estrangement can lead them to have little interest in understanding the other’s view. 

<br>In this first meeting together, each person is asked to share their own and listen to the other’s views on how the relationship got to the point where divorce is a possibility, how they have tried to fix the problems they have identified, and how their children (if any) play a role in their decision making. They are also asked to provide a brief account of a time when things were going well in the relationship.
<br>The important part in this session is that both people feel heard and respected. 


<br>The discernment counselor begins this session with the first question: 

<br>"What do you hope to get out of our time together today?"
<br>After each responds with his or her hopes for the session, you can either move on to the next question or simply acknowledge what you have heard.


<br>Sometimes people’s expectations are not directly in accord with the goals of discernment counseling.

<br>You can gently nudge them in the direction of more appropriate expectations for the 2-hour block of time:

<br>"I know that you’re looking for answers and that right now things are really tough in this marriage, but I’m not sure this session will fully answer whether divorce or reconciliation is the right direction. And we won’t be trying to solve your marriage problems today. My hope is that the things we discuss today will help launch a conversation that contributes to you both being more clear and confident in how you’ll choose to proceed with your marriage."




<br><br>
<br>Continuing with both people in the room, there is a set of questions that all clients are asked in the first session. 
<br>

<br>From the four key questions that launch discernment counseling, you should begin to get a sense of the couple’s overall relationship and some of the patterns that have governed their interactions. This is key to helping the couple see their current struggles in a new light. It is not just the recognition of the problems but seeing one’s role in the problems in the relationship and patterns of interaction.
<br>Pay careful attention to the pain that is driving the leaning-out spouse to put divorce on the table and to whether the leaning-in spouse seems to understand that pain.


<br>Sometimes there is such a disconnect between the two narratives that you have a sense that neither partner is hearing a core message of the other. You can then offer the following brief exercise: 

<br>"I’d like each of you to take a moment to reflect on whether there is something important you want your spouse to hear that you are not sure he or she is hearing. Take a moment to reflect silently, and then I invite you to say it."


<br>Opening section of the session: Time management is crucial. Aim for no more than 40 minutes for the initial couple part of the first session, which means posing the questions, taking notes, nonverbally tracking, and just occasionally intervening to clarify and maintain the process of each speaking for him- or herself.
<br><br>
<br>"What's happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?"
<br>You can ask either person to start, and you can ask either person to start, adn you can acknowledge that each partner will probably have a unique take on this question. 
<br>At times you may have to be a bit of a traffic cop to control the flow of the conversation and to stop one person from interrupting to 'correct' the story of the other. We regularly find ourselves saying things such as,

<br>"It sounds to me you don't quite agree on how they are presenting the story of how you got to this place in your marriage. That's understandable. In a moment I am going to ask you the same question because I know that you may see things somewhat differently. I'm mostly concerned with getting the views from both of you on how things got to be the way they are."


<br>Frequently one member of the couple responds for both people, as if they speak for the couple and there is high agreement on their version of the divorce narrative. When we hear this, we can stop the conversation and remind the person who is talking to speak only for themselves. 

<br>"I know you have a picture of how things got to be the way they are, but I'm concerned with the way you are referring to 'we' instead of 'I.' For example, you just said, "We know we'll always love each other." That may be true for purposes of our conversation, I want to be really clear that each of you speaks only for yourselves - your thoughts and experiences. So, I'm wondering whether what you really meant to say was that you'll always love them. I just want to make sure I'm not reading into anything you say and that both of you understand that the other may have a unique perspective on the situation."


<br>We intervene when we hear these types of 'diagnostic' impressions. What we meant to avoid is one partner being an 'expert' on the other's psychological state. It takes away from one of the goals of the discernment process, which is for each person to see his or her own unique contributions to the decline of the marriage. 
<br>It is important to hear each person so you can empathize with each one of them. 
<br>A good discernment counselor has to convey that they understand both perspectives and are willing to help both partners. Another reason to know the divorce narrative well is to begin to hear and even map out the couple's relationship pattern. 

<br>Most of them have never realized that their interactional pattern is predictable, routine, and can be changed and modified through good couples therapy.


<br>The process of asking for a divorce or initiating a divorce flies in the face of the decision and commitment to marry someone.
<br>In discernment counseling, we get the divorce narratives of both partners so we can refer to them in future conversations.
<br><br>
<br>"Can you tell me what you've done to try and fix the problems in your marriage, whether on your own or with help?"
<br>This might be because they are not sure what “counts” as a repair attempt. so, we often suggest things that might have happened:

<br>"When you say you haven’t really done anything, I’m wondering whether there are things you actually have done, but you’re just not giving yourself credit for them. For example, you may have read a self-help book or connected with a therapist, even if it was just a temporary thing. Sometimes people seek out a wise family member to bounce ideas off but don’t consider this as “actively doing something” about their marital problems. When you consider all the ways you may have tried to fix things, what comes to mind?"


<br>They are on the brink of divorce in part because they stopped turning toward each other at the developmental milestones of life. Fortunately, for many of these couples, just realizing that this has happened provides hope that if they expend effort in trying to get the marriage to a healthier place, they could see important changes.
<br>After hearing the couple’s responses to both the divorce and the repair narrative questions, you may be getting a sense of their unique interactional pattern. How do they deal with conflict or difficult situations? How do they respond to one another when life is stressful and one or both are experiencing anxiety? Later on, in individual conversations, you can begin to help them map out and describe how they respond to one another and see how they each “do” relationships, this one and probably any other intimate relationship in the future. You can begin to hypothesize possible ways to influence that pattern if the couple were to choose couples therapy in Path 3.
<br>The divorce narrative and repair questions, you have not gotten a good sense of how the couple interacts when they differ or have conflict, we recommend asking the following explicit question before proceeding with the rest of the four basic questions: 

<br>“Can you tell me a bit more about what happens between the two of you when you get into arguments or disagreements or when you experience conflict?” 


<br>Once again, what you are trying to uncover is how the couple responds to relationship interactions when times are difficult or stressful.
<br>Each one of these patterns can be changed, but to do so, each member of the couple has to see his or her unique contribution to the pattern.
<br><br>
<br>"What role, if any, do your children play in your decision-making about the future of your marriage?"

<br>The purpose of this question is to open a space for the couple to talk about their concerns for the children, who are major stakeholders in any decision they make. 


<br>Getting a sense of how the children figure into the decision-making process helps the discernment counselor understand what may be motivating each partner to work on the marriage or leave it. We do not comment on what they say in response to the children question but may refer to their answer in the individual conversations. 
<br><br>
<br>"Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy?"

<br>It comes last to end the couple time on a positive note, if possible. 
<br>But it is difficult to rewrite the relationship narrative to the point where they could escape any memories of a time when the couple found connection and joy with one another. 


<br>The responses we get from this question typically center on good early years, with fun and sharing activities before the advent of children or significant work responsibilities. 
<br>We encourage you not to settle for the minimalist response but rather probe for positive detail:

<br>Client:

<br>"Well, the early days, when we were dating - those were the best times we had."


<br>Counselor:

<br>"What was it about those early days that made it so good? What kinds of things were going on, or what felt good about being with her?"


<br>We encourage you to get this description as thick as possible (while being brief) so you can draw on any strengths in future sessions or conversations. The response to this question can also be diagnostic. 


<br><br>
<br>Before starting the individual conversations, it can be helpful to review the three paths that will be the focus of the individual conversations. You could say the following:

<br>"As we turn next to individual conversations, I’d like to remind you that in discernment counseling we focus on three potential paths that are in front of you as a couple. Path 1 is staying together as you have been. It’s the status quo path. Path 2 is the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the reconciliation path and includes a commitment to 6 months of couples therapy to see whether you can put your marriage into a healthier place for both of you. It is not the path of staying married or avoiding divorce forever. It involves taking divorce off the table for 6 months, during which time you both commit to working on yourselves and the relationship. At the end of the 6 months, you can evaluate any progress you’ve made and make a determination whether your overall relationship health is on a positive trajectory. At that point, you may have a better sense as to whether you want to pursue divorce or continue in your marriage. These three paths will frame our individual conversations today."


<br>At this point in the session you are not looking for a response about the paths from either of them. In some cases, a leaning-in partner can be all too eager to let you know that he or she is “all in” on Path 3 at this stage of the session. If that occurs, gently remind him or her that you will talk more about the paths in the individual sessions. 
<br>End the couple time by letting them know that the rest of the session will consist of individual conversations followed by a brief summary of what each has learned in the individual time, followed by a brief couple time at the end for reflections and wrap-up. 
<br><br><br>
<br>We typically begin first with leaning-out partners. our rationale is that they are usually the ones who are less interested in the discernment process and less open to reconciliation and who may be feeling misunderstood and judged by the spouse and others who worry about a possible divorce.

<br>A partner who does not feel understood by the discernment counselor will have little incentive to engage in the process fully. Therefore, begin by inviting the leaning-out partner to tell you more about his or her pain in the marriage and the reasons for considering divorce. Be empathic, and listen for additional relationship patterns or significant events that have contributed to the decline of the marital relationship. 


<br>Within no more than 10 minutes, switch to a conversation about the paths. Almost everyone, when asked about the three paths, rules out Path 1.

<br>The status quo is what brought them to the brink of divorce and to your office. Neither one is likely, at this stage, to suggest that things are just fine the way they are.


<br>For the leaning-out partner Path 2 has been on his or her mind quite a bit.

<br>You should find out more about exactly what steps he or she has taken to formalize the divorce.
<br>Each answer to questions asked to understand what attempts towards divorce the leaning-out partner has done Point to a different level of intentionality and may even address how serious the leaning-out partner is about the divorce, with more formal actions speaking the loudest.

<br>Assessment helps in the formulation or conceptualization of a case and also provides the basis for treatment planning and modifications. With any assessment, it is important to determine the following:

<br>The couple's perceptions of the problem(s)
<br>Current baseline of individual and relational functioning
<br>Physical status of each partner
<br>The couple's expectations or goals at the end of treatment
<br>Realistic treatment goals
<br>Level of sexual desire/interest for each partner
<br>Perceived degree of sexual satisfaction
<br>Level of distress experienced because of the sexual problem
<br>Impact of the sexual problem on the intimate relationship
<br>The function of sex in the relationship

<br><br>"Regarded as the authoritative reference and text, this handbook presents the most effective, widely studied approaches to couple therapy. The distinguished coeditors bring together other leading experts, most of whom developed the approaches they describe. Adhering closely to a uniform structure to facilitate study and comparison, chapters cover the history, theoretical and empirical underpinnings, and techniques of each model. The volume also describes cutting-edge applications for particular relationship contexts (such as blended families, LGBT couples, and separated couples) and clinical problems (such as partner aggression, psychological disorders, and medical issues)"--<br><br>

<br>Therapist is a coach, speaker listener and I-statements, not manualized, more responsive. Also cognitive distortion, they can't hear what your partner is saying, how is it both of them? Maladaptive process is 'he does it because he does not care about me' distress, mixture of contextual factors.

<br>EFT is an integration of an experiential/gestalt approach with an interactional/family systems approach. It is a constructivist approach, in that it focuses on the ongoing construction of present experience (particularly experience that is emotionally charged), and a systemic approach, in that it also focuses on the construction of patterns of interaction with intimate others.

<br><br>
<br>EFT adheres to the following basic premises of experiential therapies:

<br>The therapeutic alliance is healing in and of itself and should be as egalitarian as possible. In attachment terms, it offers a safe haven where emotion can be tolerated and reflected on, and a secure base where experience can be explored and expanded. 
<br>The acceptance and validation of each partner's experience is a key element in therapy. 

<br>This involves an active commitment to validating each person's experience of the relationship, without marginalizing or invalidating the experience of the other. 


<br>The essence of the experiential perspective is a belief in the ability of human beings to make creative, healthy choices, if given the opportunity. 

<br>It assumes that we find ways to survive and cope in dire circumstances, when choices are few, then later find those ways limiting and inadequate for creating fulfilling relationships and lifestyles.  


<br>Experiential therapies encourage an examination of how inner and outer realities define each other; that is, the inner construction of experience evokes interactional responses that organize the world in a particular way. 
<br>Experiential approaches take the position that we are all formed and transformed by our relationships with others. By helping partners change the shape of their relationships, the EFT therapist is also helping them reshape their sense of who they are.
<br>Experiential approaches attempt to foster new corrective experiences that emerge as part of personal encounters in the here and now of the therapy session. 


<br><br>
<br>EFT falls within the tradition of family systems therapies, drawing on systemic techniques - particularly those of <a data-href="Salvador Minuchin" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/salvador-minuchin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Salvador Minuchin</a> 's structural approach, with its focus on the enactment of 'new' patterns of interaction. The unique contribution of EFT is the use of emotion in breaking destructive cycles of interaction. By helping partners identify, express, and restructure their emotional responses at key points in patterned interactions, the EFT therapist helps them to develop new  responses to each other and a different 'frame' in the nature of the problems. 
<br>EFT adheres to the following basic premises of family systems theory:

<br>Causality is circular, so it cannot be said that action A 'caused' action B. 
<br>We must consider behavior in context. 

<br>'The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.' 
<br>To be understood, the behavior of one partner must be considered in the context of the behavior of the other partner. And the behavior of each partner is to be considered in the context of their lives, including experiences of marginalization and sources of resilience.


<br>The elements of a system have a predictable and consistent relationship with each other. This is represented by the systems concept of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Homeostasis" data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>The amygdala (the part of the brain that sets off the fight-or-flight response when one senses threat) is particularly affected by early experience; it also stores and processes emotional components of memories. 
<br>Experience not only shapes neuronal circuits; it also affects the expression of genes, or epigenetics. It appears that some of these epigenetic changes are passed on intergenerationally. Intergenerational transmission of trauma is likely shaped by epigenetics as well as lived experience in the family. 
<br>There is a fine line between tracing old wounds to the family of origin and blaming parents for clients’ problems—a not uncommon phenomenon in therapy. Within the family field, “the <a data-href="Schizophrenogenic Mother" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/schizophrenogenic-mother.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenogenic Mother</a>” and “refrigerator parents” of children with autism
<br>The contextual therapist extends concern to parents as well as the adult child client, holding a compassionate rather than a blaming stance toward the family of origin. Interventions are geared to help clients “grow up” their views of parents and siblings, toward a more complex and compassionate perspective.

<br>Bowen’s theory of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> was a major contribution to the field. 
<br>Framo (1981) was one of the earliest pioneers of family-of-origin work in couple therapy.
<br><a data-href="Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ivan-boszormenyi-nagy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy</a> developed contextual therapy which focuses on healing wounds from the past, repairing problematic intergenerational relationships in the present, and cultivating legacies for the future. 


<br>Bowen (1978) posited that anxiety leads to fusion or cutoffs within the family of origin, affecting subsequent adult relationships. His approach emphasizes autonomy and differentiation, being able to hold one's own ground and not be excessively influenced by the needs and opinions of others. Bowen theory addresses the forces of autonomy versus togetherness, and the struggles to find a balance between them. 

<br>His emphasis on autonomy and pathologizing of fusion has been criticized for being culturally myopic; many cultures value greater connectedness than Bowen endorsed. 
<br>Bowen also identified tensions between reason and emotion, encouraging greater rational control. 

<br>Feminists have critiqued this perspective, pointing to a male bias toward reason over emotion. 
<br>From a neuroscience perspective, both reason and emotion are important; it is their integration that allows for healthy functioning. 


<br>Bowen developed the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a>s.

<br>Where there is anxiety in the family, it passes from one member to another. Tension between two people is often managed by 'triangling in' a third party. 


<br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> are important in Bowen theory: ideally clear and strong, but flexible, and culture-dependent in their form and function. 
<br>Intergenerational therapists, influenced by Bowen practice, routinely use <a data-href="Genogram" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genogram</a>s in their work: drawing a family tree for each client, identifying losses and patterns of closeness–distance, mental illness, divorce, substance abuse, and so forth, going back multiple generations.


<br><a data-href="James Framo" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/James Framo" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">James Framo</a> encouraged adult clients to get to know their parents as real people. 

<br>This process can replace outdated parental introjects from childhood with more accurate, sympathetic views of parents. Framo supported clients becoming compassionate and forgiving rather than heightening anger at parents.


<br><a data-href="Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ivan-boszormenyi-nagy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy</a> developed ' <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Contextual Therapy" data-href="Contextual Therapy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/contextual-therapy/contextual-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contextual Therapy</a>, an intergenerational approach that highlights family obligations, loyalties, and legacies. 

<br>Nagy contends that adults owe their parents a debt of 'filial loyalty' - the loyalty of a child towards parents - for the care given them in childhood, even if that care wasn't optimal. 
<br>He claims that if adults are stuck in resentment or cutoff with their parents, and don't repay the filial debt, they are likely to live out unhealthy patterns from their family of origin in their current relationships. 

<br>They may seek to collect damages for the wounds of their childhood, but at the wrong address - looking to their partner or child to make up for what they did not receive early in life. Nagy claims, "The victim becomes the victimizer" through "the revolving slate of vindictive behavior."


<br>Nagy's contextual therapy focuses on 'relationship ethics,' the balance of give-and-take in family and other relationships.
<br>Nagy emphasized the obligations people have to the others with whom they interact. 
<br>The therapist, while addressing problematic intergenerational family dynamics, also helps clients identify sources of resilience or 'resource of trustworthiness' in the family of origin. 


<br><br>
<br>The neurobiology of emotional memories, behavioral patterns, and traumas from childhood impact couples in their current interactions
<br>Intergenerational transmission of stress and trauma, and research around emotional dysregulation, emotional regulation, and empathy. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiences of discrimination such as racism, sexism, or homophobia, or of trauma from war, immigration, or poverty, shape partners' vulnerabilities and survival strategies. 
<br>The couple therapist informed by intergenerational theory is sensitive to the cultural background and values of clients, assessing intergenerational-cultural wounds, as well as strengths that impact couple functioning. 
<br>The dominant US culture privileges 'Power Over' (a win-lose competitive model of relationships) and individualism, valuing individual rights over responsibility to others. 

<br>By contrast, many collectivist cultures emphasize responsibility and concern for other as well as self and obligations within the intergenerational family. 
<br>Couple therapy is enhanced by incorporating a nuanced view of power, addressing Power Over imbalances between partners, while offering clients techniques for developing 'Power To' (living according to one's higher values) and 'Power With' (co-creating a relationship of respect, fairness, care, and compassion)


<br>Identity is not something one authors alone; it emerges in relational contexts. Within couples, partners enhance or diminish each other's identity. 
<br><br>
<br>Intergenerational therapy addresses legacies inherited from prior generations (consciously or unconsciously) and legacies passed on to the future (intentionally or unintentionally). How one relates to the past affects how one acts in the present and what is bequeathed to the future: "The dimension of relational ethics can be thought of as a bridge from one's past, stretching through oneself to the future."
<br><br>
<br>The language clinicians use affects interaction with clients. It is more productive to describe unhappy couples as “distressed” rather than “dysfunctional.”
<br>Behaviors that are causing distress within the couple—often based in survival strategies—while problematic now, may have been adaptive in the family of origin.
<br>Problematic survival strategies do need to be challenged in couple therapy - but from a place of respect and compassion for the contexts in which they evolved. 
<br><br>
<br>Long-term love takes work, commitment, compassion, and generosity of spirit. But this is easier said than done. The pain and disillusionment when the rose-colored glasses come off are often exacerbated by seeing the partner through the filter of unfinished business from one's family of origin. 
<br>For the couple to withstand the disappointment of infatuation's passing and work together to build a more lasting love, they need to reckon with wounds from the past that are reactivated with each other. 
<br><br>
<br>Vulnerabilities from childhood are activated (e.g., a sense of inadequacy, feeling unprotexted, overwhelmed, or abandoned), triggering self-protective survival strategies (e.g., defending, withdrawing, criticizing, or attacking). 
<br>The survival strategies of one trigger the vulnerabilities of the other, activating in turn the other's survival strategies, as the couple gets caught in an escalating cycle of reactivity. 
<br>Distressed couples see their interaction in linear terms, each feeling like a victim and blaming the other. 

<br>Happier couples, while they may get upset with each other, are able to look at their cycle from above; they see their interactions as circular, taking responsibility for their own contribution to the cycle. 


<br>When partners are able to speak directly from vulnerability rather than attack from survival strategy, they are more likely to get a sympathetic response. Speaking from vulnerability elicits empathy; attacking from survival strategy begets defensivesness, counterattack, or withdrawal.

<br>Partners with flexible and adaptive survival strategies are more likely to be successful in relationships. If survival strategies haven't evolved since childhood, they may be rigid and inflexible. 


<br><br>
<br>Happy couples repair well and often. 
<br>Repair is a complex process, including awareness of the other’s hurt and perhaps feeling guilt over one’s role in the hurt. Many people are allergic to guilt.
<br>While neurotic guilt is damaging and pervasive, healthy guilt is one’s conscience, an acknowledgment of having hurt another, prompting repair. 
<br>Repair also entails apology. 

<br>If one was forced or humiliated into apologizing as a child, it may be hard to apologize to the partner now. 


<br>Finally, repair entails forgiveness. 

<br>Some people refuse to forgive, fearing that if they do, they will lose their leverage or be taken advantage of in the future. 


<br>The experiences and role models each partner had in the family of origin for apology and forgiveness can help or hinder the partners now in their attempts at repair.
<br><br>
<br>Secure attachment with parents in childhood promotes trust and a sense that relationships are benevolent and safe. 

<br>This sense of trust is brought to the adult intimate relationship, as the couple develops a secure bond. 

<br>But if one or both partners did not experience secure attachment in childhood, it may be harder to trust each other.




<br>A blaming, resentful stance from childhood may be reenacted with the partner. Feeling like a victim of parents often leads to a more generalized victim stance, including in the couple relationship.
<br>Each partner’s vulnerabilities and survival strategies, which fuel the couple’s cycle or impasse, stem from experiences earlier in life, particularly in the family of origin.
<br>Linking these internal processes of hurt and self-protection to experiences in childhood can soften the couple interaction, facilitating partners’ increased capacity for self-responsibility and compassion.
<br><br>
<br>Humans function on autopilot most of the time, driven by emotions and habits wired into the brain since childhood. Happier couples are more thoughtful and able to choose their responses, and less driven by old habits or emotional reactivity.
<br>The therapist helps distressed couples develop skills of emotion regulation, increasing proactive choice rather than knee-jerk reactivity. 
<br>Unhappy couples get caught up in negativity, becoming emotionally dysregulated, driven to fight-or-flight by their amygdala. Instead of offering comfort, partners become sources of threat to each other.
<br>Even in the absence of physical violence, partners can become reactive. The nature of the threat is frequently related to experiences in childhood. Thus, a critical partner evokes emotional memories of a critical parent. And emotions are contagious. When the amygdala takes over, the higher brain, the prefrontal cortex, goes offline.
<br>The therapist helps distressed couples develop tools for emotion regulation and explore issues from the family of origin that are activated in the couple escalation. In identifying their survival strategies and reflecting on the intergenerational contexts in which they evolved, clients increase thoughtfulness and decrease knee-jerk reactivity.
<br><br>
<br>A competitive, Power Over approach to conflict characterizes many unhappy couples. Clients who grew up feeling disrespected or disempowered may be more inclined to utilize Power Over behaviors with their partner. Happier couples are able to share power, rejoicing in each other’s successes, offering compassion in the face of hurt, making room for each other’s voice.
<br><br>
<br>Distressed couples often struggle over reality. Underneath the fight lurks the question of whose fault it was. Happier couples make room for both their realities. Each one cares about how the other sees the world and their relationship. 

<br>If partners were raised in families where there wasn't room for their own experience, they may be more inclined to fight over reality with their partner. 


<br>The therapist helps clients consider the stories they tell about their partner and family of origin. The lenses through which adults see their parents are often the same lenses through which adults see their partner. The capacity to rethink one's narratives and make room for multiple perspectives differentiates happy from distressed couples. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Nagy's concept of <a data-href="Multidirected Partiality" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/multidirected-partiality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multidirected Partiality</a>, the therapist sides with each individual, while also holding concern for the relationship itself. 
<br>It is 'couple therapy': a space for two individuals to see if they can co-create a more satisfying relationship. 
<br>The therapist helps each explore family-of-origin experiences relevant to their relational impasse. 

<br>'Corrective scripts' can be as constraining as 'replicative scripts', when one either repeats the same patterns as the family of origin or goes in the opposite direction. Both partners were shaped by their family-of-origin wounds. 

<br>The therapist helps create a new script for their relationship that isn't haunted by the past. 




<br>With a contextual perspective, the therapist is concerned about the impact of the couple's relationship on the children and about the impact on the couple relationship of children who are particularly challenging. 
<br><br>
<br>Couple therapy is enhanced when each partner is or has been in individual therapy that increases reflectiveness and self-responsibility. 

<br>The exception is if the individual therapist sees their client as victim and blames the partner, without encouraging the client to explore their own issues. 


<br>In couples where partners have not been in individual therapy, the therapist may refer one or both to an individual therapist to do parallel work to the couple therapy; or the couple therapist may periodically see both partners individuals in addition to couple sessions. 
<br>In individual sessions, clients are encouraged to consider their own survival strategies in the context of their families growing up. Reflecting on how and when one uses these survival strategies in the couple relationship facilitates differentiation, self-responsibility, and relational empowerment.
<br>An agreement is created about confidentiality around individual disclosures in these sessions. Couple therapy is not viable if one partner asks the therapist to keep a secret (e.g., an affair).
<br>Trust in the therapeutic relationship is key, and secrets betray that trust.
<br><br><br>
<br>A balanced therapeutic alliance is crucial for the success of couple therapy; the therapist does not accept the role of judge. If there is egregious or abusive behavior, the therapist takes a stand; violence is out of bounds and the principle of safety first is bedrock in any therapy. 

<br>Nevertheless, even setting limits and identifying problematic behavior is done from a place of concern and compassion. The therapist maintains a stance of “multidirected partiality” partial to each partner, on each one’s side. When clients feel understood and affirmed, the therapist can challenge them. Multidirected partiality is not neutrality; the therapist cares about both partners, is partial to each. But the partiality is balanced.


<br>The couple therapy office must be a “shame-free, blame-free zone,” a safe environment for clients to explore their vulnerabilities and relational disappointments. 
<br>It is crucial that clinicians be aware of their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies, and note when they get caught up in a vulnerability cycle with clients. Therapists need to address unfinished business with their own family of origin.
<br><br>
<br>The therapist holds a stance of compassion, helping clients give voice to their vulnerabilities, yearnings, and pain. Each must feel understood and validated, that their vulnerabilities are held with care, their survival strategies respected.
<br>Once the therapist hears the family-of-origin context in which vulnerabilities and survival strategies evolved, it is easier to convey that respect. It is only from this position of affirmation that problematic aspects of survival strategies can be challenged.

<br>The therapist must constantly balance validating and holding both partners, even while challenging them.


<br><br>
<br>Clients “resist” clinical interventions. This approach is collaborative, viewing “resistance” as important feedback. It is vital that the therapist not engage in a power struggle with clients. 
<br>The intergenerationally oriented couple therapist is active, wearing different hats at different times: witness, coach, teacher, explorer of past influences on current impasses, facilitator of emotional expression and dialogue.
<br><br>
<br>Informed by contextual theory, the therapist holds in mind every person affected by this therapy, not just the individual or couple who comes in for treatment.
<br>Therapists who blame parents for a client’s problems create “iatrogenic” problems for the client.

<br>Parent-blaming by the therapist sets up a loyalty bind for the client between the “good” therapist and “bad” parents.
<br>While on rare occasions a parent may be currently dangerous (e.g., violent or abusing substances), most parents are not evil, violent, or psychotic; they are simply functioning with their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies. Pitting client against parents is damaging, likely to keep the client stuck in a victim position—lived out now in the couple relationship.


<br>Contextual therapists endorse a more expansive and compassionate view of parents in their own intergenerational context, extending multidirected partiality to the family of origin.

<br>The therapist is not challenging the client’s story of childhood pain, or denying or whitewashing the wounds of the past. Rather, the client is helped to understand parents’ limitations in terms of their life journey.


<br><br>
<br>Formal questionnaires or screening tools are not utilized, but individual and relational strengths and challenges are assessed, considering individual, interpersonal, intergenerational, neurobiological, and sociocultural levels of functioning.
<br><br>
<br>Why is this couple calling now? What has changed in their lives that is prompting them to seek treatment? Who makes the call? Do both partners want to come to therapy? What are their agendas (which may differ)? Does one want to leave the relationship, while the other wants to work on it? Did a crisis prompt the call for treatment?

<br>Partners may not be equally motivated to work on their relationship or stay together. Assessing motivations and goals is crucial.


<br><br>
<br>Assessing for safety is always a central concern. 

<br>Is there a risk or history of violence, drug or alcohol abuse? 
<br>Does one feel threatened, or unsafe, even without physical abuse? 
<br>What are the couple’s power dynamics? 
<br>Does one partner regularly defer and the other prevail? What options does each have outside the relationship?
<br>If one partner is dependent on the other financially, with no resources of their own, power may be limited. 


<br>Rather than assuming that partners are equal, the therapist assesses power differentials, including those related to race, class, or education. In mixed-gender couples, power issues related to gender have particular import.
<br><br>
<br>From the beginning, the therapist assesses couple interaction. As therapy progresses, the interactional patterns emerge more fully, and couple and therapist co-construct the vulnerability cycle diagram. 

<br>The therapist assesses the flexibility or rigidity of each partner’s survival strategies, identifying the vulnerabilities underneath. Over time, the intergenerational backstory of each partner’s vulnerabilities and survival strategies emerges. Family history is discussed, including attachment histories, losses, or abuse.


<br><br>
<br>The therapist evaluates the emotional stability and functioning of each partner.

<br>Is there depression, anxiety, or other mental illness? If so, is it being treated? 
<br>Does either have physical or health challenges? 
<br>How able are they to tolerate frustration, criticism, or emotional intensity? 
<br>What are their emotion regulation skills? 
<br>What is their capacity for mentalization and dialogue?
<br>Can they make room for each other's perspective?
<br>How generous is each partner with the other? Or are they more competitive?


<br><br>
<br>The therapist assesses the couple’s sociocultural resources and stressors. 

<br>If they have children, are there emotional, cognitive, or health issues? 
<br>What are the stressors or strains for the couple vis-à-vis their families of origin? 
<br>Have they experienced trauma or oppression such as racism, marginalization, or homophobia? 


<br>The assessment may extend further back, to trauma in preceding generations, as in Holocaust survivor families, descendants of slaves, or war or immigration experiences. 

<br>What are the intergenerational legacies of pain or humiliation, trauma or loss, that may be impacting these partners now?


<br>In addition to considering stressors in the larger familial and cultural context, the therapist evaluates strengths and resources. 

<br>What support is available to this couple from families or friends? 
<br>Are there faith resources or other communal connections that sustain them?


<br><br>
<br>The therapist considers clients’ developmental journeys as individuals and as a couple. 

<br>What prior relationships has each had? 
<br>How did they get together? 
<br>Did they fall in love? 
<br>How has their relationship evolved? 
<br>When did their problems start? 


<br>The couple’s work and financial status are assessed as well.
<br><br>
<br>As the couple tells their story, the therapist begins drawing their genograms. This isn’t a formal project in the first session; the therapist meets them where they are, hearing the story of their current pain. 
<br>At some point during the first few sessions, therapist and couple fill in the genograms, identifying family members and exploring the quality of the relationships and experiences of loss, abuse, or other violations in the multigenerational family.
<br><br>
<br>The therapist attunes to the interplay of relational ethics in the couple.

<br>What are the levels of trust and trustworthiness in each partner? 
<br>Do they experience their relationship as fair? 
<br>Are they able to hold each other in mind and tolerate multiple viewpoints? 
<br>Does each have a voice, and can they hear the other?


<br>The ability to consider the impact of their behavior on the other’s wellbeing is explored. Of particular import is each partner’s capacity for taking responsibility and listening with respect and curiosity. 
<br>The therapist assesses the extent of blame in their interactions, the ways they have disappointed and hurt each other, and their ability for empathy and repair.
<br><br>
<br>The identification of more specific goals is a collaborative process between therapist and couple. Initially, each partner may have different goals. Yet, fundamentally, most partners want similar things. As homework, I ask each to write 'The Ten Commandments of Our Relationship'

<br>From these lists, their joint values and goals are identified and operationalized, targeting behaviors that reflect these goals. Occasionally, partners have very different values that cannot be mutually accommodated. Therapy can be used productively to identify irreconcilable differences and, if the couple chooses, to separate with the least possible damage.


<br>For a clinician informed by intergenerational and particularly by contextual theory, a core goal is facilitating mutual responsibility and relational ethics. 

<br>Distressed couples often feel disconnected, each partner disconfirming the other. One of the goals of therapy is to develop a shared narrative that incorporates a “we,” as well as each “I,” rekindling the connection and affirmation they had early on.


<br>Values from the culture of individualism and competition can be damaging to couples. 

<br>The therapist helps partners consider their responsibility to each other, as well as their rights. They are encouraged to become more empowered, live up to their higher values, and “reach for their best self.”
<br>Carrying old wounds and resentments from the family of origin can impair the ability to be one’s best self with the partner; “growing up” one’s survival strategies is enhanced by “growing up” views of and relationships with family of origin.


<br><br>
<br>Therapist and clients jointly assess regularly how the couple is progressing toward their goals. When they have largely met their goals, or want to practice more on their own, they may stop, take a break, or have longer spacing between sessions, using monthly or bimonthly meetings as “checkups.”
<br>Treatment is not “terminated”; the therapist is available in the future should the need arise. Couples are encouraged to call if needed, without waiting for a crisis. Reengaging in couple therapy is not a sign of failure. The therapist is a long-term resource for the couple.
<br><br>
<br>Healing old wounds and developing new perspectives on intergenerational relationships can free the couple to coauthor their relationship in keeping with their values.
<br><br><br>
<br>After many repetitions of their cycle, distressed couples often experience the five “disses”: Partners are discouraged, disconnected, dysregulated, disempowered, and “dissing” each other. Each is helpless as the familiar cycle unfolds.

<br>The therapist facilitates the development of hope and agency through increasing connection, learning techniques for emotion regulation, building skills of relational empowerment, and enhancing respect—antidotes to the “five disses.”
<br>The therapist offers a circular view of their interaction, working toward mutual empowerment and responsibility. The shift from blame and self-protection to empathy and self-responsibility engenders a proactive rather than reactive stance in each partner.


<br><br>
<br>Couples caught up in reactivity are driven by their emotional brains. Living on autopilot, they enact habitual, unproductive sequences based in survival strategies developed in the family of origin.

<br>The therapist helps each partner bring prefrontal thoughtfulness to amygdala reactivity. The ability to choose their response rather than react habitually is empowering for clients.


<br>Partners work to become authors of their own responses and coauthors of their relationship rather than victims of each other. They consider the impact of their behavior on the other’s sense of self, cultivating “preferred relationship practices”—lived aspects of relational ethics.

<br>This shift to thoughtful authorship in their responses to each other is enhanced as partners explore family-of-origin factors that have fueled their own reactivity.


<br><br>
<br>Emotion regulation is key to transforming the vulnerability cycle. There are individual differences in the capacity to self-regulate, due to both genetic variation in stress reactivity and childhood experiences.
<br>Techniques for emotional regulation:

<br>“Top-down” cognitive techniques, such as naming one’s emotion (which activates the prefrontal cortex and calms the amygdala). 
<br>Reappraisal (reframing), a mental shift that allows one to see the partner in more open or sympathetic ways. 
<br>Identifying goals, values, and intentions can also help clients moderate their reactions. 
<br>More body-based, “bottom-up” techniques such as deep belly breathing, mindfulness meditation, or taking a break to calm down.


<br><br>
<br>Partners in a couple, seeing the same moment in different ways, may engage in “dueling realities.”
<br>Making room for multiple narratives and differences of perspective and opinion, and recognizing the right of each to their own experience, are key aspects of relational ethics. Mentalization is the awareness that others have their own ways of thinking and experiencing.

<br>The therapist offers “construal humility” as a model, noting that we all construe or make sense of our world, but there are multiple ways to look at most interactions. Making room for dual narratives rather than dueling narratives is a key skill of relational ethics in both couple and intergenerational relationships.


<br><br>
<br>The nuances of each partner’s survival strategies and the vulnerabilities fueling them are not so readily apparent, but emerge over the course of several sessions, at which point couple and therapist together draw the diagram.
<br>Couples appreciate seeing their personal and interpersonal dynamics in the diagram, understanding how each one’s self-defense is triggering the other. The circular nature of the interaction becomes clear.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,295 deaths nationwide in 2010 as a result of IPV - 10% of all homicides. 
<br>Rates among female and male same-sex couples are similar to those among mixed-sex couples. 
<br>Aggression often begins at young ages, with 9% of high school students reporting physical violence by a boyfriend or girlfriend.
<br>Clinic samples show similar rates of injury to men (15%) and women (12%).

<br>Men are more likely to use severe violence, and women experience greater psychological (e.g., depression, trauma symptoms) and physical (injury, death) consequences. 


<br>Partner aggression is more common among couples who seek therapy, with on average half reporting physical aggression and 76–95% reporting psychological aggression by males and 69–95% psychological aggression by females.
<br>As advocates for victims drew attention to battering of women in the 1970s, cases were addressed by providing shelters and using courts to mandate treatment for male perpetrators.
<br>In the 1980s, some writers still suggested that women played a role in maintaining abusive relationships and were blameworthy for not leaving violent male partners.
<br>Due to gender-based power imbalances and patriarchal values, couple therapy was dangerous for victimized women.
<br><br>
<br>Four patterns of physical violence among mixed-sex couples:

<br>Patriarchal Terrorism or Battering (primarily by a male against a female to exercise control)
<br>Violent Resistance (by a female to counteract male violence)
<br>Mutual Violent Control (bilateral violence for control)
<br>Situational or Common Couple Violence (bilateral, mild to moderate, expressing unhappiness)


<br>Partner aggression is not restricted to mixed-sex couples. 
<br>Forms of psychological aggression (e.g., hostile withdrawal, denigration of the partner, domination and threats of violence, and restriction of the partner’s freedom) commonly precede and co-occur with physical aggression.

<br>Rates of psychological aggression among community couples are approximately 75%.

 <br><br>
<br>DSM-TR is a manual for assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders and does not include information or guidelines for treatment of any disorder. 
<br>Determining an accurate diagnosis is the first step toward being able to appropriately treat any medical condition, and mental disorders are no exception. 
<br>DSM-5-TR is helpful in measuring the effectiveness of treatment, as dimensional assessments will assist clinicians in assessing changes in severity levels as a response to treatment. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br>A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. 
<br>Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. 
<br>Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from dysfunction in the individual, as described above. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The DSM is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria which facilitate diagnosis.
<br>It is the standard reference for clinical practice in mental health. 
<br>Please also be familiar with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-10 Codes)
<br><br>
<br>The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continues to evolve.
<br>Too rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. 
<br>The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... the degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder).
<br>Clinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis. 
<br>The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress. 
<br>Reliable diagnoses are essential for:

<br>Guiding treatment
<br>Identifying prevalence rates
<br>Identifying clients for clinical research
<br>Documenting public health information


<br><br><br>
<br>Standardizes billing and coding
<br>Standardizes diagnoses and treatment
<br>Guides research
<br>Guides treatment
<br><br>
<br>Oversimplifies human behavior
<br>Increases risk of misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis
<br>Provides labels, which can be stigmatizing
<br><br>
<br>Growing scientific evidence favors dimensional diagnosis of mental disorders.
<br>Takes into account individual subjective report of symptom experience and clinician interpretation. 
<br>Integrates both objective and subjective data to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process.
<br>Integrates measures administered at initial interview and over time to track symptom status and response to treatment. 
<br><br>
<br>A categorical approach to assessment relies on diagnostic criteria to determine the presence or absence of disruptive or other abnormal behaviors, whereas a dimensional approach places such behaviors on a continuum of frequency and/or severity. 
<br><br>
<br>Ask Categorical (Yes/No)
<br>Ask Frequency (How often?)
<br>Ask Intensity/Severity (Rating: mild, moderate, severe)
<br>Ask Duration (How long does it last?)

<br>Common feature is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. 
<br>What differentiates the diagnoses?

<br>Duration, timing, and etiology of symptoms.


<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder</a>:

<br>Diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years old or after age 18. 
<br>By history of observation, the age of onset is before 10 years old. 


<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>:

<br>Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset increases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20 s.

<br>The essential feature of persistent depressive disorder is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year for children and adolescents. 
<br>Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood, adolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course.

<br>Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, it is estimated that 5-10% of adults suffer from depression. 
<br>Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. 
<br>More women are affected by depression than men. 
<br>Depression can lead to suicide.

Bipolar and Related Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>The main thing to remember about the difference between Bipolar I and II, 
<br>Mania is more problematic and have more disturbing behavior. Impulsive spending, gambling, and sex. May put themselves in risky situations (involving money, sex, drugs), some may be hyperfocused. Full blown mania usually have serious consequences. Some part of their life was profoundly impacted. Think about the time part. Severe because it can lead to serious consequences. How long did it last. Bipolar I and II is not a difference. 
<br>Is it lasting for a long period of time or a short period of time? 
<br><br>
<br>It is a common misperception that children cannot have bipolar disorder. 
<br>Although most people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood, the symptoms can appear earlier in childhood. 
<br><br><br>
<br>In children, happiness, silliness, and “goofiness” are normal in many social contexts; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet the Criterion A mood requirement of abnormally elevated mood. For the happiness or silliness of a child to meet Criterion A, it must be distinctly increased from the child’s baseline and accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that to those who know the child well are clearly unusual for that child. For a child’s symptoms to meet criteria for a manic episode, the symptoms must also meet Criterion B for mania and must also represent a change from the child’s usual baseline.
<br>In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the child’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.
<br>The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal association with other symptoms of mania.
<br>The peak age at onset of bipolar I disorder across studies is between 20 and 30 years, but onset occurs throughout the life cycle.  
<br>Special considerations are necessary to apply the diagnosis in children. Because children of the same chronological age may be at different developmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “expected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her own baseline in determining whether a particular behavior is “normal” or evidence of a manic episode.
<br><br>
<br>Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier than for major depressive disorder. Age at onset does not reliably distinguish between bipolar I and II disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs.
<br><br>
<br>For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode.  
<br>Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter. The vast majority of youth with cyclothymic disorder experience the onset of mood symptoms before age 10.
<br><br>
<br>Bipolar I Disorder
<br>Bipolar II Disorder
<br>Cyclothymic Disorder
<br><br>
<br>Bipolar I disorder is a manic-depressive disorder that can exist both with and without psychotic episodes. 
<br>Bipolar II disorder consists of depressive and manic episodes which alternate and are typically less severe and do not inhibit function. 
<br>Cyclothymic disorder is a cyclic disorder that causes brief episodes of hypomania and depression. 
<br>Bipolar I (Mania)
<br>Bipolar II (Hypomania)
<br><br>
<br>Lasts at least one week, or any length if hospitalized due to mania

<br>Abnormal and persistent extreme expression of emotion or irritable mood and abnormal and persistent increase in activity or energy.

<br>Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity
<br>Decrease in need for sleep
<br>More talkative than baseline or fast talking
<br>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
<br>Distractibility (reported or seen)
<br>Increase in goal-oriented activity (especially, at work, school, or sexually) or movements that serve no purpose
<br>Excessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (e.g., unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretion or foolish business investments)

<br>Inflated self-esteem and grandiosity
<br>Decrease in need for sleep
<br>More talkative than baseline or fast talking
<br>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing

<br>Excessive engagement in activities with high risk of painful results (unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions or foolish business investments)


<br>Unambigious change in functionining not characteristic of the person when not symptomatic
<br>Mood disturbance and change in function are observable by others
<br>Episode does not cause significant impairment and is not severe enough to require hospitalization

<br>If there are psychotic features, it is a manic (not hypomanic) episode.

<br>Exposure therapy is effective for reducing compulsive behaviors, even for people who did not respond well to medication. With ERP, people spend time in a situation that triggers their compulsions (such as touching dirty objects) and they are prevented from engaging in their typical compulsion (such as handwashing). Although this approach may cause feelings of anxiety at first, compulsions decrease for most people as they continue treatment.

<br>Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event (s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event (s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following:

<br>Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.

<br>Derealization:

<br>Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant, or distorted). Note: To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medication condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).

<br>Trauma takes root in and impacts an individual's limbic and endocrine systems
<br>For individuals to develop a stress reaction, some sort of traumatic event must occur. 
<br>Traumatic events originate in an individual's system or environment
<br>Trauma originates outside the individual 
<br>Trauma disuptes the affected individual's larger systems

<br>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)
<br><br>
<br>Common feature is disruption and/or discontinuity in consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior that significantly affects the individual's capacity to function. 
<br><br>
<br>Dissociation is often experienced as an internal, isolating experience
<br>The impact of current partners and families is profound
<br>Treatment can be enhanced when considering the impact on families and family's impact on dissociation
<br>Family reactions to dissociation range:

<br>Dismissal, disbelief, relief, shame, surprise, confusion


<br><br>
<br>Dissociation is a disintegration of psychological functions such as attention, consciousness, and memory

<br>Ranging from zoning out to the clinical diagnosis ofDID


<br>Amnesia: an inability to recall id DID
<br>Amnesia: an inability to recall identity or events, losing time
<br>Identity Fragmentation: Lack of integration between memory and sense of self
<br>Depersonalization: Disconnecting with the outside world
<br>Identity Alteration: Distinct personality states develop
<br><br>
<br>The primary focus of treatment is integration
<br>Associating those elements of functioning that have been disconnected
<br>The client's current family environment is vital to the treatment prognosis
<br>The inclusion of family in therapy requires careful consideration, especially with regarding to childhood trauma

<br>Common feature is developmental differences that produce impairments of personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. 
<br><br>
<br>A group of conditions with onset in the developmental period
<br>Typically manifest early in development
<br>Often before the child enters grade school
<br>Are characterized by developmental diffeences in brain processes that produce impairments of personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. 
<br>The range of developmental differences and possible deficits varies from very specific limitations of learning or control of executive functions to global impairments of social skills or intelligence.

<br><br>
<br>Differences in social communication and social interaction. 
<br>Restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. 
<br>Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period. 
<br>Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in functioning (social, academic, occupational)
<br><br>
<br>There is not just one cause of ASD
<br>There are many different factors that have been identified that may make a child more likely to have ASD, including environmental, biologic, and genetic factors. 
<br>Although we know little about specific causes, the available evidence suggests that the following may put children at greater risk for developing ASD:

<br>Having a sibling with ASD
<br>Having certain genetic or chromosomal conditions, such as fragile X syndrome or tuberous scierosis
<br>Experiencing complications at birth
<br>Being born older parents


<br><br>
<br>Developmental monitoring (collecting or gathering information) and screening (testing). 
<br>Surveillance or developmental monitoring is an active ongoing process of watching a child grow and encouraging conversations between parents and providers about a child's skills and abilities. 
<br>CDC's Learn the Signs Act Early program has developed free materials, including CDC's Milestone Tracker app, to help parents and prociders work together to monitor children's development and know when there might be a concern and if more screening is needed. 
<br>Screening is when a parent or provider completes a checklist or questionnaire specifically designed to identify problems that need further evaluation. 
<br>General developmental screening should occur at the 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well child visits and whenever a concern is expressed. 
<br>Autism-specific screening should additionally occur at the 18- and 24- or 30-month visits and whenever a concern is expressed.

<br>1% of the population
<br>Unclear whether higher rates reflect expansion of diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, or true increase. 
<br><br>
<br>Intervention and support may mask difficulties in at least some contexts. 
<br>Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the severity of the condition, developmental level, and chronological age; hence the term spectrum. 
<br>Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple sources of information: clinical observations, caregiver history, self-report (when possible)
<br><br>
<br>'Red Flags' for autism. Do not use this language when discussing symptomatology. 
<br>DSM-5 perpetuated that "only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work independently in adulthood; those who tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills."
<br>DSM-5-TR:

<br>While it was once the case that only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder lived and worked independently in adulthood, as diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made more frequently in those who have superior language and intellectual abilities, more individuals are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills and thus are productively employed. 
<br>Access to vocational rehabilitation services significantly improves competitive employment outcomes for transition-age youth with autism spectrum disorder. In general, individuals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently.


<br><br>
<br>1 in 11 children
<br>Boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as girls
<br>Symptoms can change over time

<br>Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms may decrease, but inattentive symptoms often remain


<br>Inattention and impulsivity can put children's health at risk from injury and disease. 
<br>Best treated with behavior therapy, specifically parent training, and medication. 
<br>Most common treatment is medication

<br>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person think, feels, and behaves. 
<br>People with schizophrenia may seem as though they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. 
<br>The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities. 
<br><br>
<br>Delusions
<br>Hallucinations
<br>Disorganized Thinking (Speech)
<br>Disorganized or Abnormal Behavior
<br>Negative Symptoms (Mood)
<br><br>
<br>Altered perceptions (e.g., changes in vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste), abnormal thinking, and odd behaviors. 
<br>People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality and experience themselves and the world in a distorted way. Specifically, individuals typically experience:

<br>Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there
<br>Delusions, which are firmly held beliefs not supported by objective facts (e.g., paranoia - irrational fears that others are 'out to get you' or believing that the television, radio, or internet are broadcasting special messages that require some response)
<br>Thought Disorder, which includes unusual thinking or disorganized speech.


<br><br>
<br>Loss of motivation, disinterest or lack of enjoyment in daily activities
<br>Social withdrawal
<br>Difficulty showing emotions
<br>Difficulty functioning normally
<br>Specifically, individuals typically have: 

<br>Reduced motivation and difficulty planning, beginning, and sustaining activities

 <br>
<br>A group of disorders that are typically characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. 
<br>Disturbances in sexual response or sexual pleasure.  Clinically significant. 
<br><br>
<br>Destigmatize clinical assessment of sexual dysfunctions. 
<br>Understand the risk factors. 
<br>Assess for sexual functioning in the clinical interview. 
<br>Remember that in many couples, underlying sexual dysfunctions exacerbate the presenting problem - whether that be issues in intimacy, communication, conflict resolution, infidelity, mood disorders, etc. 
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Conduct the evaluation in comfortable surroundings and ensure privacy
<br>Be empathic, nonjudgmental, and understanding
<br>Preferably use the language in which patient is comfortable
<br>Use neutral terms (as opposed to vulgar terms) and proper medical terms as long as there are in common usage (e.g., use 'penis' and 'vagina,' but perhaps 'lips' rather than 'labia')
<br>Use anatomical drawings to understand patients knowledge and explain sexual issues to the patient
<br>Reassure the patient that sexual dysfunction or adjustment problems are common and treatable. ("It is common for some people to...")
<br>Explain things in simple, clear and specific terms. Some patients may not be able to understand the language which is commonly used by clinicians and may feel embarrassed to admit this. Hence, whenever new terms are used, provide alternatives or explanations. Check with the patients that they understand the terms used
<br>Start with general, non-threatening questions first (e.g., "Do you have a regular partner?") then ask more specific and potentially embarrassing questions (e.g., "Do you also experience this problem when you masturbate, that is, when you touch or stimulate yourself?")
<br>Assumptions must be avoided (e.g., sexual orientation, numbers of partners, sexual practices)
<br>If a couple has presented together, gather the information for a sexual history from each individual separately (i.e., not in each other's presence)
<br>Conduct the evaluation in presence of a female attendant/relative while examining patients of opposite gender
<br>Make sure that the 'problem' does not just reflect a lack of knowledge or unrealistic expectations on the part of the presenting individual or their partner. 
<br>Understand the cultural and religious factors which influence sexual issues
<br>Although sexual dysfunction may occur in isolation, in many cases there may be co-existing problems contributing to the dysfunction (e.g., relationship difficulties, psychiatric or physical illness) - prioritize the treatment goals in such situations
<br>Assess psychological sophistication and motivation of the patient/couple
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Bio / psycho / social
<br>Trauma
<br>Insecurity
<br>Exposure / Introduction to Sex
<br>Distraction
<br>Depression
<br>Anxiety
<br>Poor Communication
<br>Myths
<br>Self-Image
<br>It is usually not just one thing. There may be multiple drivers. Remember, all behavior makes sense in context. 
<br>Rule out physical / biological, then proceed to psycho / social contributors.

<br>The science of diagnosis and mental disorders continue to evolve.
<br>Too rigid a categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations. 
<br>The validity of diagnosis is important (that is... The degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological disorder)
<br>Clinical training and experience is needed to use the DSM for determining a diagnosis.
<br>The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal life variation and responses to stress.
<br>Reliable diagnoses are essential for:

<br>Guiding treatment
<br>Identifying prevalence rates
<br>Identifying clients for clinical research
<br>Documenting public health information

<br>It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. 
<br>Manic Episode

<br>A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
<br>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:

<br>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 
<br>Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
<br>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 
<br>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 
<br>Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 
<br>Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness non-global-directed activity).
<br>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).




<br>
<br>The mood disturbance 
<br><br>
<br>The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by related changes that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. (pg. 178)
<br>What differs among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology.
<br><br>
<br>The presentation of children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol.
<br>For children up to 12 years of age. 
<br>Children with this symptom pattern typically develop unipolar depressive disorders or <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a>, rather than bipolar disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood. (pg. 178)
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. 
<br>The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. 
<br>The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. 
<br>The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
<br>The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). 
<br>Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. 
<br>Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. 
<br>The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. 
<br>By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. 
<br>There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. 

<br>Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. 


<br>The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>)

Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 
<br>If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. 


<br>The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. 

<br><br>
<br>A diagnosis based on a single episode is possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of cases. 
<br>Careful consideration should be given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Bereavement" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a> may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode of major depressive disorder. 

<br>When they do occur together, the depressive symptoms and functional impairment tend to be more severe and the prognosis is worse compared with bereavement that is not accompanied by major depressive disorder. 
<br>Bereavement-related major depressive episodes tend to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders.

<br>Neurodevelopmental disorders can be defined as a series of complex traits that emerge as a result of genetic determinants interacting with various poorly understood environmental components resulting in a diverse clinical presentation. 
<br>The onset and diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders occurs in childhood. 

<br>These disorders rarely experience a remission or relapse and are considered to be a stable set of symptoms over time, and thus neurodevelopmental disorders appear throughout the individual's life span. 


<br><br>
<br>
<br><br><br>
<br>Bipolar disorder affects and is affected by the family system and successful treatment is enhanced when family embers understand the course and treatment of the illness, respond in supportive ways, and stay patient and empathetic within the context of constructive communication and problem-solving. 
<br><br>
<br>Bipolar Disorder takes a significant toll on personal efficacy and self-worth and is often bewildering to family members as they try to manage the symptoms of the illness and support their affected loved ones in the midst of frustrating and competing interpersonal, social, and logistical factors. The emergence of Bipolar Disorder as manifested by intense periods of mania, often followed by periods of deep depression, disrupts peace, tests relationships, clouds future dreams and aspirations, and often destroys marriage and family relationships. 
<br><br>
<br>The presence of mania (As manifest in Bipolar I Disorder) or hypomania (As manifested in Bipolar II Disorder), which is a state of intense, energized mood, cognition, and behavior, resulting in an increased capacity for creativity and clarity of thought (Rational and irrational), rapid ideas and racing thoughts, sometimes irritability and impatience with others, reduced need for sleep, distractibility, and objective-focused activity, and/or energy present most of the time during the episode. 

<br>With mania and hypomania, there is a decreased need for sleep, increased sexual desire, and a need for stimulation, which can involve risk-taking behaviors resulting in painful and/or harmful consequences. The subjective experience of mania is also characterized as paradoxical where there is a lightning-fast epiphany beyond the vision of all others, which produces a feeling of grandiosity and power. Many who experience mania describe feeling frustrated at their limited capacity to experience and carry forward these creative insights, like drinking water from a fire hose. 
<br>Mania, but not hypomania, is also sometimes accompanied by delusional thinking and psychosis, which mimic symptoms of <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. Hypomania contains similar symptoms manifest in mania, but of a lesser duration and lesser intensity, and is a characteristic of Bipolar II Disorder. 


<br>The most frightening time for those experiencing mania is when it begins to dissipate because for many it signals the descent into depression. Another complex manifestation of depression is Bipolar With Mixed Episodes. These depressive episodes are characterized by deep sadness, hopelessness, feelings of emptiness, fatigue, lack of energy, loss of appetite, listlessness, dysphoria, and apathy for a minimum of 2 weeks. 

<br>Depressive episodes are often attended by shame and embarrassment for the consequence of manic actions, a lack of pleasure in activities once enjoyable, the need to isolate from others, a sense of worthlessness, guilt, stomach aches and pains, troubled sleep, and thoughts of death. Whereas in mania, the risk of death is typically from thrill seeking, in depressed individuals, the primary risk of death is suicide. 
<br>Many who suffer from bipolar depression describe the subjective feeling of depression as intense as is the feeling of mania. Mania is characterized as the 'highest of highs' whereas depression is characterized by the 'lowest of lows.'
<br>Suicide is a very real concern for the bipolar client, family, and friends, and those treating bipolar persons. In the course of antidepressant of bipolar disorder, or depression, the first symptoms that respond to treatment are a lack of energy (i.e., people become more energized) and sleep (i.e., people tend to sleep between when on antidepressants), and one of the last symptoms to clear up is mood. This makes people with Bipolar Disorder especially susceptible to suicide because they actually have the energy to kill themselves. States of high energy along with depression increase suicidal risk. 


<br>The <a data-href="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-of-mental-disorders-(dsm).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</a> categorizes Bipolar and Related Disorders as: 

<br>Bipolar I Disorder:

<br>Characterized by a manic episode lasting 7 days or longer


<br>Bipolar II Disorder: 

<br>Characterized by a hypomanic episode lasting no more than 4 days. 


<br>Cyclothymic Disorder:

<br>Characterized by hypomanic symptoms that would not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a hypomanic 'episode' and depressive symptoms that would not meet the full symptom criteria for a depressive 'episode.'

<br>This includes a lower level of intensity of both extremes, a lower level of frequency with symptoms occurring for 4 days compared to 7 days for a manic episode, and a subthreshold of symptoms necessary to meet the disorder.




<br>Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder:

<br>Characterized by symptoms of mania precipitated by a particular medication or substance (e.g., illicit or prescribed) and Bipolar Disorder Related to a Medical Condition, in which symptoms of mania can be precipitated by a health-related condition. 




<br>Mania becomes the primary symptom distinguishing Bipolar Disorder from other depressive disorders and causes significant 'impairment in social and occupational functioning,' as well as a disruption to family relationships and functioning, which is the general standard that distinguishes problematic behavior from a mental disorder. 
<br><br>
<br>Prevalence rates for all Bipolar Disorders for adults are 3.9% over the lifetime with 2.6% of the adult population meeting diagnostic criteria in a given year and 2.5% of adolescents meeting them over the lifetime with 2.2% of the population meeting criteria in a given year. Approximately 1.7% of adolescents report having mania along during the lifetime, and 1.3% report having manic symptoms in a given year. 
<br>50% to 67% of adults reported the onset of Bipolar Disorder before the age of 18 and 15% to 28% reported experiencing symptoms before 13 years. 
<br>There is some evidence suggesting that women experience Bipolar II Disorder at a higher rate. Women also tend to experience higher 'rapid cycling' (i.e., four or more mood episodes within a single year) and more 'mixed states' (i.e., mixed symptoms or 'features' of mania and depression within a single episode) than men. 
<br>Bipolar Disorder with Mixed Features is especially difficult to treat with psychotropic medication because of the nature of simultaneous manic and depressive symptoms. 
<br>There is a hereditary component in Bipolar Disorder, 'A family history of Bipolar Disorder is one of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for Bipolar Disorders.'
<br>Over 90% of those experiencing a manic episode eventually have recurring episodes and roughly 60% of individuals having a manic episode also have a depressive episode, so the likelihood is high that mania persists within individuals with multiple episodes, including episodes of depression. The persistence of symptoms within the interepisode phases of the illness indicates that, for many, there is never a break within this chronic condition. 
<br>Depressive episodes in the bipolar cycle are much more difficult to treat and that individuals spend much more time in depressive states than manic ones; research suggests as much as three times as many weeks during the year with depressive symptoms versus symptoms of mania. Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, often debilitating condition that requires a multifaceted treatment approach to manage effectivity.
<br>For both adults and adolescents, symptoms of Bipolar Disorder can be comorbid with a wide variety of other disorders including <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> (including specific phobias), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, serious and often untreated medical conditions, and, for adolescents, disruptive and/or conduct disorder, and 'disorders with prominent irritability.'
<br><br>
<br>The primary treatment of Bipolar Disorder is psychopharmacologic, and typically starts with lithium bicarbonate and other mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics and anxiolytics that are often prescribed in the acute phase of the illness. 

<br>Because individuals with Bipolar Disorder often have sleep disturbance, sleep medications are often prescribed to regulate circadian rhythms. Good sleep hygiene is one of the easiest and best ways to help prevent triggering mania. The use of electroconvulsive therapy is an option for entrenched, severe, and persistent depressive symptoms. 


<br>A common and frustrating feature of medication treatment for bipolar individuals is medication compliance. Individuals affected with Bipolar Disorder often find the effects of drug therapy as blunting the euphoric effects of the experience of mania, and develop abhorrence to the side effects of the medication. They are also often resistant to the idea that they will be taking medications for the rest of their lives in order to maintain a balances mood, to help them make reasoned choices, maintain their interpersonal relationships, and support systems, and lower the incidence of additional and severe episodes. 
<br>Re-hospitalizations for bipolar patients was lowest in the multifamily group, and the researchers pointed to the potential that patients may have learned to see themselves as less of a burden on family members, to experience more support from others (especially their own families), to feel less isolated, and to feel enhanced hope in learning how to cope more successfully with their condition. 

<br>Family and social relationships are central to the affected person's ability to live successfully with this condition.

<br>Individuals experiencing manic and depressive symptoms reflect the bewilderment, anger, hopelessness, and existential despair often felt in family members who struggle to support their impacted loved one while at the same time trying to make sense of what is difficult to accept: that their loved one has a chronic condition that will persist throughout their life and, as family members, they too travel a parallel path. 
<br><br>
<br>The tangible consequences include being introduced into the legal system with adolescent or adult family members who may act out during a manic episode and violate the law. 
<br>Other potential, practical consequences include unemployment resulting from inconsistent or poor job performance; impulsive and poor financial decisions resulting in loss of income, savings, or retirement resources; loss of social status within the community; interfacing with mental health agencies and social services and a wide variety of mental health personnel; and often being marginalized by a mental health system that does not recognize the legitimate burden family members carry and the inability to access important treatment information on behalf of their affected loved one because of right to privacy and confidentiality. 
<br>Sometimes partners of spouses, sons and daughters of parents, and parents of children may cut off and/or leave or divorce the impacted relative because of the stress attendant to this condition. These life disruptions cast a pall on other family and social activities and center the collective energy and family resources on addressing the problem. It is difficult to maintain hope in the future under these conditions. 
<br><br>
<br>The intangible or emotional fallout for the family is a real and felt experience and centers on working to accept the disorder and attendant consequences. 

<br>When an affected individual is in a manic state, family members may initially find the observed behavior as interesting or exciting, but soon turn to distress and anxiety as their loved one becomes more impulsive, unpredictable, and erratic; the family member may leave and not return home for days. If the manic episode is new to family members, there is often confusion about how to respond and about the immediate need for perspective. Often, family members seek to discern differences between the illness and the characteristics of the affected loved one in an attempt to make sense of their behaviors. If the affected individual is a parent, children and other family members need reassurance; if a child, parents may seek to discipline or reason with their loved one with little success. 
<br>Some become violent, destructive, and/or manifest delusional and psychotic symptoms that are frightening, and family members are faced with having to protect and be protected from the affected family member. 
<br>If the manic episode is repeated as part of the course of the illness, family members become retraumatized to the episode and may seek equilibrium through a variety of behaviors, ranging from acting out themselves (mostly in children) to calm responding to the situation and following a predetermined plan. Often family members try to reason with the affected member with little success. During episodes of depression, family members seek to motivate and instill hope within their family member and often face their own sense of hopelessness and despair when attempts to support, encourage, and offer solutions are rejected or treated with indifference. 


<br>"One's attention is focused on the wellbeing of the person with Bipolar Disorder in such a way that one's own needs take second place. Being closely related to someone with Bipolar Disorder also means simultaneously foreseeing and following the often sudden and unexpected changes of the person with Bipolar Disorder."

<br>The DSM system is based on a medical model and is inherently limited in validating treatment approaches other than medical. 

<br>The <a data-href="Cultural Formulation Interview" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diversity/cultural-formulation-interview.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cultural Formulation Interview</a> provides a framework to assist clinicians in assessing the cultural identity of the affected individual, perceptions of the distress (including how the cultural group of the client would view the problem), psychosocial stressors and 'cultural features of vulnerability and resilience,' and cultural aspects of both the client and the clinician that might impact treatment. Viewing culture therapeutically includes a perceptual expansion of cultural groups to include age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, occupation, military service, social networks, substance use, migration status, geographical region, relationship status (i.e., married or divorced), and not simply race and ethnicity. 


<br>Though Bipolar Disorder presents with similar incidence in men and women across races and cultures, there is some observable difference in the course and progression of the disorder. This is due primarily to differences in initial diagnosis, access to treatment, and perceptions of stigma associated with mental health. 

<br>Comparing individuals with Bipolar Disorder from African ancestry with those with European ancestry, a trend was observed in the misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, most often as <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. 

<br>It is possible that behaviors observed in minority patients during a manic phase are more commonly misconstrued as psychotic rather than manic. Another possibility for the misdiagnosis of schizophrenia in minority patients with Bipolar Disorder may be related to fears associated with seeking mental health services and an inherent mistrust of a system that has historically oppressed and marginalized them. Presenting as extremely guarded, paranoid, or having a blunt affect - all common symptoms of schizophrenia - may be rational expressions resulting from their previous experience of racism. 




<br>Minority groups are disproportionately affected by challenges to healthcare access and experience greater stigmatization for seeking mental health services. 

<br>Some minority groups may be disproportionately affected by environmental factors and social inequities, which may directly and indirectly contribute to both the development and progression of Bipolar Disorder. 


<br>It is advocated that clinicians use empathy and authenticity when working with Bipolar Disorder clients, and to not be afraid of conflict within the process of making therapeutic contact. 

<br>"The meeting and initial work with manic persons is often complicated. When we meet with them, we collide with them. We have to confirm the collision, not deny it."


<br>Demonstrating empathy for paranoid and grandiose thinking is not only critical for a successful therapeutic alliance, but gives the clinician a more accurate assessment as to the extent of the client's delusions, grandiosity, and paranoia. 
<br>Counselors modeling for clients a sense of humor and often a playful attitude in their interactions together help clients learn to more realistically view themselves and reality-test relationships. Humor, appropriately and skillfully used, also helps reinforce for clients that their counselors do not view them as a culmination of their manic and depressive episodes, but as people who can be related to, which is empowering to them. 

<br>Bipolar-affected clients often know that they negatively impact loved ones and others, and, as a result, feel deep shame and guilt for what is often irritating and offensive behavior, having a place that is safe for them to explore different ways of seeing themselves is important. 


<br>The job of the clinician:

<br>First, to seek to existentially be with manic patients and then, to counterprojectively give perspective to those patients about their manic worldview, without completely denying it. 

<br>This can lead to a healthy therapeutic alliance, which itself has a mood-stabilizing effect. Along with mood-stabilizing medications, this alliance can lead patients towards full recovery. 


<br>The therapeutic relationship provides a place where the bipolar client can experience acceptance and the family can receive real and targeted support. 
<br>It is important therapists show patience and adaptibility in working with patients with Bipolar Disorder and their families. 

<br>Self-esteem, belief in one's own efficacy, and engendering hope for the present and future functioning is vital for those suffering from Bipolar Disorder. This awareness on the part of the therapist guides treatment and ameliorates the dysfunctional beliefs, the black-and-white thinking, and blunts the corrosive effects of mania and depression. 


<br>Counselors should directly involve the family in the treatment of the identified family member with Bipolar Disorder. Family members can often provide much more accurate and rich perspectives regarding what happens when the family member with Bipolar Disorder is manic and/or severely depressed. 
<br>Counselors can help clients with Bipolar Disorder to develop 'advanced directives' that may include signed consent from clients about how the illness is to be addressed or treated, including being treated against their will if they are in a full-blown manic or depressed episode. 

<br>We want clients with Bipolar Disorder to be thinking about the course of their illness and making decisions about treatment when they are balanced, lucid, and making rational judgements rather than when they are manic or depressed. This can best be accomplished within the context of supportive family members who can express understanding and empathy, while at the same time express clearly the consequences of clients' manic and depressive behaviors and advocate strongly for responsive and responsible actions to be take. 




<br><br>
<br>Genetic, biological, and environmental factors do not appear independent of each other but all 'interact in bringing about episodes of mood disorder or in protecting against their occurrence.' Understanding how these factors mutually impact and are impacted by each other over the course of the disorder can help manage episode occurrence and develop resilience in affected individuals and their families. 
<br>Genetic and biological vulnerability includes the manifestation of the disorder in members of an affected person's family (i.e., who in the family has or has had the bipolar or related disorders), brain functioning (i.e., to what level may there be structural or brain abnormalities and quality of functioning and dysfunction in neurotransmitters), and other biological factors (e.g., chemical imbalances, changes in hormonal and immune system functioninig, sleep regulation). When vulnerability is high in these areas, the amount of environmental stress needed to trigger a manic or deppressive episode tends to be low. 

<br>Those with high vulnerability have a low tolerance for and little protection form events that others without the disorder might manage quite well. Those with low vulnerability to genetic, neurologic, and biological factors would likely not be vulnerable to mood episodes unless there were high social stressors at play. 
<br>Low environmental stress acts as a protective factor from the occurrence and reoccurrence of mood episodes. Because the nature of genetic or biological vulnerability may be hard to detect and determine, managing environmental stress becomes a high priority in treating and managing bipolar episodes and their severity. 


<br>Psychosocial Provoking Agents:

<br>Largely impact vulnerability and the manifestation of manic and depressive states. Because Bipolar Disorder impacts individuals and families in often unpredictable and disorientating ways, and because of the consequences within the family, family members often assume patterns of responsing that range form being long-suffering, helpful, and supportive to being critical, blaming, and something uncooperative. These reactions contribute significantly to the emotional climate within the home and impact the perpetuation of continued episodes. 
<br>'Cause and Effect relationships between mood disorder symptoms and family environmental factors are bidirectional: Families are affected by Bipolar Disorder as much as they affect it.'


<br>The Vulnerability-Stress Model was developed from research on family interactions with patients with schizophrenia. 
<br>Emotional Expression (EE) is a measure of emotional attitudes among relatives of a psychiatric patient. It is defined as critical, hostile, or emotional overinvolvement statements and attitudes family members communicate overtly or indirectly to the member (s) affected by the disorder. 

<br>High EE Level within Family (Z 63.8) captures this dynamic. 
<br>Individuals with Bipolar Disorder are two or three times more likely to deteriorate into a manic or deppressive episode in families where high EE exists and experience prolonged and more severe manic or depressive states.
<br>High EE causes stress that contributes significantly to the perpetuation of mood episodes. 
<br>EE develops and is perpetuated between the affected child and their parents. The child reinforces high EE reactions within parents, which impacts all relationship functioning. Children who exhibit behaviors and attitudes consistent with a low tolerance for stress, unstable mood, elevated anxiety, irritability, and problematic cognitive functionining largely meet the criteria for high biological and generic bulnerability. 
<br>Generational influences within high EE families can significantly impact the vulnerabilities of family members who may be predisposed to Bipolar Disorder and bulnerable to criticism toward their condition. 


<br>The Vulnerability-Stress Model helps clinicians assess and further understand not only the relationships between genetic, biological, and socioenvironmental factors, but helps focus attention on the EE and the quality of interpersonal reactions in the home that could be either provoking manic or depressive mood states or protecting affected individuals from their recurrence. 
<br><br>
<br>Assessments for Bipolar Disorder are characterized as the individual assessment and diagnosis of the disorder while family assessment addresses essential aspects of the family environment including the quality of family interactions. 
<br><br>
<br>A thorough biopsychosocial assessment should be conducted on the client upon the initial intake (or shortly thereafter) to capture a comprehensive context in which the presenting problems occur. 
<br>All biopsychosocial assessments should include:

<br>Mental health history
<br>Medical family history
<br>Personal history that includes a developmental timeline
<br>Conducting a mental status exam (i.e., appearance, behaviors/psychomotor activity, attitudes affect and mood, intelligence, and reliability, judgement, and insight)
<br>Legal problems
<br>Substance use
<br>Spirituality/religion
<br>Cultural/ethnic background
<br>Suicidal ideation (including ideation, plan, attempts)
<br>Financial concerns and socioeconomic status
<br>Resources and Resiliency factors
<br>Utilizing the Level I and Level II Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures associated with the DSM-5 can also provide a targeted assessment of symptoms, including the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale. 

<br>Another helpful measure that can detect both threshold and subthreshold levels of mania is the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Bipolar Disorder Screening Scale. 




<br>The goal of individual assessment is to obtain a differential diagnosis; it is important to:

<br>(a) administer formal assessments ethically and according to the protocols specified in specific instruments including being trained in the administration and interpretation of data
<br>(b) gather and make sense of the data and share the results with clients in a manner that is comprehensible, clearly explaining the



                                                         eliminations of assessment and assessment results. 
<br>(c) use the data to confirm existing clinical impressions and/or to generate new clinical directions. 


<br>Consultation with other professionals, including those of a treatment team is essential. 
<br>The family can provide important context for the counselor in diagnosis and treatment, which leads to the process of family assessment. 
<br><br>
<br>As part of the protocol of a comprehensive family assessment with all willing family members present, the counselor have the family (or a family member and the affected bipolar member) engage in conversation regarding their relationships or how they have attempted to solve problems they experience for 5 to 10 minutes and to observe and note the number of EE statements that are generated within the interaction and what the statements are. 

<br>This gives important data about the level of EE, but sensitizes counselors to what family members value, what they may be struggling with, and the process and context of their conversations. 
<br>Developing sensitivity to the quality and types of interactions family members have can give counselors useful information in designing treatment, including the <a data-href="Genogram" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/genogram.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genogram</a>, which can be used to develop an understanding of where Bipolar Disorder (and other mental health problems) has occurred within the family. 

<br>A genogram is a multigenerational family tree that symbolically represents different dynamics related to family and individual functioning that is psychologic, cultural, and interpersonal in nature. 




<br>The Mood Disorder Burden Index was developed to assess caregiver perceptions and experiences in three core domains: patient mood symptoms, caregiver's worries about the future, and caregivers' interpersonal difficulties with the patient. 
<br>The Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale:

<br>A self-administered instrument designed as an alternative to psychiatric measures that fail to assess for treatment outcome and recovery and well-being for those afflicted with Bipolar Disorder. It can give counselors insight into how the individual with Bipolar Disorder has been impacted by the disorder and, indirectly, how the family has been impacted. 


<br>Counselors should always be mindful of being client centered, empathically inquisitive, and validating of the subjective experience of clients and their families as information is gathered during the assessment process. Assessment is a continuous process of measuring symptom reduction, improvement in family communication and problem-solving, acceptance, and self-efficacy living with Bipolar Disorder. 
<br><br>
<br>Pharmacological intervention with an integration of individual psychotherapy is more effective than either protocol alone. 
<br>Goals for treatment have focused on symptom reduction and prevention of future episodes. 
<br>Psychosocial stressors can directly contribute to, or even catalyze, the occurrence of a bipolar episode. The occurrence of an episode can aggravate psychosocial stressors. 
<br>Broader systemic influences including systemic racism, poverty, a global health crisis can all put a strain on an individual's ability to regulate emotion, something that is particularly difficult for individuals with Bipolar Disorder. 

<br>A cycle can develop of constant challenge and crisis, which may self-perpetuate without the disruption of systemic treatment. 

<br>Treatment of Bipolar Disorder should take an integrative approach to best serve the client's needs which invariably includes family systems work. Bipolar Disorder actually comprises a group of heterogeneous disorders, with significant variations in etiology, manifestation, and severity. 




<br>The questions becomes not whether family systems treatment is or is not effective for Bipolar Disorder, but how and when it can be applied and adapted according to the needs of the client and family. 
<br><br>
<br>FFT is an integrative approach to treatment of Bipolar Disorder, which combines psychoeducation and family therapy. It has been shown to enhance family cohesion and reduce family conflict. 
<br>FFT begins with a thorough assessment of individual symptomology and family systems dynamics, and proceeds through a structured and preset treatment, with specific goals throughout the duration. 

<br>Important elements of assessment:

<br>Gather as much information during intake as possible. 
<br>Identify family conflicts that may be contributing to the stress across the system, which in turn can exacerbate Bipolar Disorder symptomology in the identified client. 
<br>Determine the presence and severity of other environmental stressors - such as low socioeconomic status, experiences of oppression and marginalization, or experiences of extreme stress or trauma - which can impact family members individually as well as the relationships across the system. 
<br>Understand the strengths and protective factors across the system that can support the emotional regulation of the individual with Bipolar Disorder, as well as the overall health of the family system. 

<br>This information informs both the psychoeducation and therapy components of treatment, as it guides both specific goals and interventions. 


<br>Understand the clients' cultural beliefs, practices, and influences on the family system. This is important to not only to provide a context to the experiences and dynamics of the system, but also to provide the counselor with a perspective on how FFT may need to be adapted somewhat to maximize efficacy. 
<br>Determine appropriateness of the type of intervention.

<br>The extremes of bipolar episodes cause significant conflict in family systems, and may make some or all members unwilling to participate. Not all individuals are appropriate for the FFT protocol. Persons who are in acute phases of Bipolar Disorder, have developmental disabilities or other biological conditions that impact cognition, refuse to adhere to medication protocols or have a comorbid active substance use disorder are among those for whom FFT is not recommended. 






<br>FFT is an effective treatment for Bipolar Disorder and its use can significantly impact relapse of the disorder. 
<br>Higher rates of anxiety, depression, and general distress were found in caregivers of those diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. 

<br>Family-based interventions improve illness outcome and caregiver well-being. FFT has been found to have a positive impact on the mental health of caregivers, even when the diagnosed family member is not participating in the treatment. 


<br>The course of treatment of FFT for Bipolar Disorder is fairly structured and is based on three treatment stages: (a) psychoeducation, (b) communication enhancement training (CET), and (c) problem solving.

<br>Treatment using FFT usually lasts approximately 9 months, and is structured around 21 sessions that generally generally begin following an acute phase of Bipolar Disorder. Clinical sessions are conducted weekly for the first 3 months, followed by a step-down to bi-weekly, then once per month. The philosophy of FFT is that Bipolar Disorder is experienced by the family, not just by the diagnosed client.

<br>As Bipolar Disorder episodes are viewed as 'disaster' experiences shared by the family system, which in turn cause disequilibrium. 


<br>The treatment is reestablishing balance and harmony to the system, which in turn supports the health and wellness of the diagnosed client. 


<br><br>
<br>Counseling goals are identified early in treatment and are informed from intake and assessment sessions. 
<br>FFT for Bipolar Disorder begins with 6 general goals that outline and guide the overall process:

<br>Integrate the experiences associated with episodes of Bipolar Disorder.

<br>The focus of this goal is to understanding the diagnostic features of Bipolar Disorder as well as the experience of it from the perspective of the diagnosed individual. It also helps family members accept both the severity and significance of the diagnosis. 


<br>Accept the notion of a vulnerability to future episodes.

<br>The focus of this goal is in the recognition that Bipolar Disorder is a chronic, persistent, lifelong diagnosis that requires continual support. The diagnosed individual - as well as the family - may believe that the condition can be 'cured' and thus have an unrealistic expectation of treatment. The periods of stability that occur between episodes can often contribute to this incorrect assumption. 


<br>Accept a dependency on mood-stabilizing medication for symptom control.

<br>Consistent use of mood-stabilizing medication can minimize the intensity of Bipolar Disorder episodes and prevent future occurences. 
<br>The undesirable side effects of many medications can make the client less willing to maintain this portion of the treatment protocol. 


<br>Distinguish between the client's personality and the Bipolar Disorder.

<br>Over time, the diagnosed individual may be viewed by family members solely through the lens of the disorder. This can lead to inaccurate assumptions about the meaning and importance of behaviors. 


<br>Recognize and learn to cope with stressful life events that trigger recurrences of Bipolar Disorder.

<br>FFT is based on the Vulnerability-Stress Model. This model includes both an understanding of preexisting biological conditions that create vulnerability and the environmental stimuli that trigger or catalyze reactions based on this vulnerability. 

<br>While biological components cannot be altered, clients and families should understand how psychosocial stressors such as conflictual relationships, major life changes, and severe emotional stressors can impact the vulnerability of an individual with Bipolar Disorder. 




<br>Reestablish functional relationships after the episode.

<br>The key features of this goal are support and connection. The before, during, and after phases of Bipolar Disorder episodes can be aggravated by the conflicts that arise across family systems in response to the situation. 
<br>A goal for treatment is enhancing communication patterns within the family system and providing families with coping skills. 




<br><br>
<br>In the initial stage of treatment using the FFT model, the primary goal is psychoeducation. This stage is broken down into phases with focus on different informational needs. 

<br>In the beginning, the clinician imparts a great deal of vital information to the family system. It is important for this to be done in a warm, interactive manner. Clinicians using FFT must be aware of the potential for this stage to devolve into a solely instructional experience and take intentional, conscious steps to avoid this. 

<br>Continually checking in with family members and encouraging discussion about the material can minimize this risk and enhance rapport with family members. 




<br>In the beginning of the psychoeducation stage, the clinician should provide an overview of the FFT protocol, reasons for family participation, and the role of the clinician in the treatment process. Treatment goals should also be addressed, both the general FFT-based goals and the specific goals for the family system. This is also a good time to provide an overview of Bipolar symptomology, as well as prodromal symptoms and environmental triggers. 

<br>The clinician should take the time to explore the unique experiences and perspectives of each family member. Often it is the associated meaning for the system members that impacts the manner in which they cope with and react to a Bipolar Disorder episode. 


<br>Discussions around environmental triggers are an important way for families to better understand the blind spots they may have regarding the diagnosed family member's vulnerabilities. Events that may be considered minor, benign, or otherwise simply normal life events to some family members may prove to be substantially more stressful for the family member with Bipolar Disorder. 

<br>A lack of empathy for the different experiences of the family member with Bipolar Disorder may also create conflict, as the affected family member may feel unsupported and misunderstood.

<br>The DSM-5-TR <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of excessive or paralyzing fear and/or intense anxiety with associated disturbances in behavior. 
<br>More adults were reporting anxiety-related symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic while more youths reported anxiety-related symptoms by the end of 2020. 

<br>Various factors such as fear for the health and welfare of themselves and their families, inconsistent daily routines including school closures, and mounting tension in their homes have led to increased reports of anxiety in children. 
<br>Despite experiencing anxiety-related symptoms to be diagnosed the individual must exhibit symptoms of significant distress or impairment across multiple domains in functioning (e.g., familial, social, academic, or occupational).


<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Anxiety disorders" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety disorders</a> share the key features of intense fear or anxiety, avoidance of feared stimulus, and can cause life interferences, emotional distress, and impaired functioning. 
<br>The distinguishing features differentiating the DSM-5-TR <a data-href="anxiety disorders" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">anxiety disorders</a> are the focus of each anxiety disorder or the core feared stimuli, and the focus of the fear informing the other individual domains of focus in the DSM. These domains include:

<br>Cognitive Response

<br>The cognitive response for the anxiety disorders is worry. Individuals with anxiety tend to exhibit two cognitive errors:

<br>Overestimating the probability of a negative event (i.e., thinking a negative event or outcome is much more likely to happen than objective reality)
<br>Catastrophizing (i.e., thinking the worst-case scenario will happen)




<br>Physical Response

<br>The physical component is the physical response to fear such as muscle tension, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, and other symptoms associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. 


<br>Behavioral Response

<br>The behavioral response to anxiety is the active avoidance of the feared stimuli. 




<br>In SAD (social phobia), the core feature is the fear of negative evaluation by others. It follows that across the other individual domains the core feature of fear, anxiety, or both would be consistent. An individual meeting criterion for SAD would fear being evaluated by others (core focus of their anxiety; cognitive component). The individual may sweat, tremble, or experience heart palpitations (physical component) as well as avoid giving speeches or talking in class (behavioral component).
<br><br><br>
<br>Anxiety disorders represent one of the highest prevalent disorders within children and adults. It is estimated that 15%-20% of children and adolescents are affected by an anxiety disorder. An estimated 40 million adults in the US have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

<br><br>
<br>Anxiety disorders severely impair physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, academic functioning, and the overall quality of life of an individual. 
<br>Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are sick more days from work and have lower work productivity. 
<br>Individuals with anxiety disorders are common patrons of primary care settings, specialty clinics, and emergency room services. 
<br>Individuals with anxiety disorders have higher rates of relationship distress and divorce. 
<br><br>
<br>A <a data-href="Risk Factor" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Risk Factor" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Risk Factor</a> is defined as any attribute, characteristic, or experience that increases the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder. 

<br>A risk factor and the root cause of an anxiety disorder may differ greatly; therefore, having a risk factor is not the same as causing an anxiety disorder. 


<br>Genetics or hereditability increases risk for all of the anxiety disorders. Individuals with first-degree relatives (e.g., parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder are at an increased risk to develop an anxiety disorder. 

<br>30% to 40% of variance in the anxiety disorders is due to genetics. Other risk factors contribute more than half of the variance to the development of anxiety disorders.

<br>Most temperaments are inherited, and family members are also likely to have similar temperaments. Parents are likely to model and reinforce their child's tendency toward BI or emotionality. 


<br>Stressful life events and trauma relate to an increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder, such as early parental loss, childhood abuse, previous trauma, and peer victimization. 
<br><br>
<br>Anxiety disorders are often maintained by several individual factors. An individual factor is identified as something that is internal or based on the individual as opposed to a family or societal factor that maintains anxiety disorders. 

<br>The individual factors and systemic factors influence one another in a reciprocal manner. An individual's behavioral response and cognitions develop within the context of their family. 


<br>Several behavioral factors have been linked to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. <a data-href="Behavioral Avoidance" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/behavioral-avoidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Behavioral Avoidance</a> maintains all of the anxiety disorders. 

<br>In the short term, behavioral avoidance is a coping strategy that temporarily relieves anxiety; however, long-term behavioral avoidance is a key factor in maintaining all anxiety disorders. 
<br>Many times the larger system, either the family or school, reinforces behavioral avoidance of feared stimuli. 


<br>Cognitive factors that maintain anxiety are the thoughts and thinking styles contributing to maintaining an anxiety disorder. 

<br><a data-href="Attentional Bias" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/attentional-bias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attentional Bias</a> for threat maintains anxiety disorders. Individuals with an anxiety disorder tend to pay more attention to stimuli that appear threatening to them, and they have difficulty noticing anything else other than the perceived threatening stimuli. Individuals with anxiety disorders perceive neutral stimuli as dangerous compared to individuals without an anxiety disorder. 
<br>A second cognitive factor related to the maintenance of anxiety disorders is <a data-href="Cognitive Avoidance" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-avoidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive Avoidance</a>. 
<br>Attentional bias and cognitive avoidance are internal processes; however, the family system or larger systems influence the internal process of attentional bias and cognitive avoidance. Many parents model attention bias for children. 

<br>Parent may model cognitive avoidance, teaching their children to respond in the same manner. In adult romantic relationships, a partner may influence the process of cognitive avoidance as well. 




<br><br>
<br>The majority of research on the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders focuses on the individual variables or individual therapy. 
<br><br>
<br>Relational factors related to the etiology or maintenance of anxiety disorders:

<br><a data-href="Relationship Quality" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/diagnosis/key-terms-and-concepts/relationship-quality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Relationship Quality</a>

<br>Lower relationship quality within the couple or family system relates to anxiety disorders.
<br>Couple conflict, lower relationship satisfaction, and couple violence all correlate with adult anxiety disorders. 
<br>Couple distress has been linked to an increased risk in developing an adult anxiety disorder. 
<br>Conflict between parents consistently relates to childhood anxiety disorders. 
<br>Individuals within a relationship who experience high attachment anxiety will often question their partner and behave in hypersensitive ways in an effort to avoid rejection which increases relationship distress.

<br>Sexual dysfunction (SD) is typically viewed as biologically based, yet a person's lived sense of sexual wellness is most often situated within relational, interpersonal, and cultural contexts.
<br>Sexual health is shaped by the interaction of a person's unique biological, psychologic, and cultural experiences and has significant impacts on mental, emotional, and relational well-being. 
<br>Earlier editions of the DSM were also critiqued for omitting gendered differences in sexual functioning. 
<br>Clinical judgement based on biopsychosocial context is recommended in diagnosis, particularly when the client possesses identities that are marginalized socially and within clinical research.

<br>Clinical judgement is urged in ruling out the following causal factors:

<br>Inadequate sexual stimulation
<br>Cultural factors that may impact the experience of pleasure
<br>Problems better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, substance use, a medical condition, or by several relational distress, partner violence or other stressors. 


<br>The DSM-5-TR uses the subtypes of lifelong, acquired, generalized, and situational to designate the onset of the sexual problem. A variety of factors that should be considered during diagnostic assessment include:

<br>Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems; partner's health status)
<br>Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication; discrepancies in desire for sexual activity)
<br>Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement)
<br>Cultural or religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity or pleasure, and attitudes toward sexuality)
<br>Medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment


<br>If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code for the relationship problem or stressor may be listed. 

<br>The usefulness of reframing the term dysfunction as a 'sexual concern,' 'issue,' or 'challenge' in the effort to depathologize sexual difficulties and adopt a more normalizing perspective when discussing sexual issues with clients. 


<br><br>
<br>Modalities of family/relationship systems therapy (e.g., internal family systems, Imago therapy, and emotionally focused therapy) to support the treatment of sexual issues for individuals and relationships. 
<br>Sexual issues are most often first encountered and then subsequently treated and resolved within the context of intimate partnerships.

<br>In the United States, societal sexual norms are often extensions of cisgender, heterosexual, White, patriarchal, Judeo-Christian, and able-bodied assumptions of sexuality. 

<br>For this reason, many individuals - especially those with historically marginalized identities - develop an internalized sexual worldview that lies in contrast with their own sexual realities. This incongruence can lead to misinformation about one's sexuality, internalized shame, insecurity, and a myriad of other barriers that may negatively impact sexual functioning, sexual pleasure, and sexual communication and negotiation with partners.


<br>Culturally or religiously imposed values can shape a person's emotional experience related to sexuality in meaningful ways that can hinder and/or support one's sexual well-being.
<br><a data-href="Intersectionality" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/intersectionality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intersectionality</a> - which posits that individuals hold multiple, intersecting social and cultural identities, each carrying certain privileges and oppressions given the individual's broader sociocultural and political landscape.

<br>Counselors seek to understand the ways in which a client's complex experience of power and oppression shapes their sexual functioning, as well as to explore the client's unique protective and risk factors given their multifaceted identities.


<br><br>
<br>Even in instances when sexual concerns are not the primary reason for seeking counseling, sexual assessment provides the clinician with an important opportunity to assess for possible comorbidity with presenting issues, better understand the client's cultural and relational values, and normalize the presence of sexual discussion amidst the counseling process.
<br><br>
<br>General sexual wellness assessment can be included in initial intake paperwork, as well as in follow-up sessions once therapeutic rapport has been established. Examples include:

<br>How would you currently describe your overall sexual wellness?
<br>What concerns, if any, do you currently have about your sex life or current level of sexual satisfaction?
<br>On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), how would you currently rate your sexual wellness? How did you arrive at that number? What changes would you like to see in that number? 
<br>Are there any issues related to your sexual health and wellness that you would like to discuss in counseling?


<br>For couples, general sexual wellness assessment can include other items on couple intimacy and sexual wellness. Examples include:

<br>How would you currently rate your sexual intimacy today? How does that compare to other times in your relationship?
<br>If you could have any changes to your current sexual relationship, what would you hope to see?
<br>How do you define physical intimacy in your relationship? How important is physical intimacy to your overall relationship health?
<br>How might your sexual relationships be related to your primary reasons for seeking couples counseling at this time?


<br>Counselors can help clients with initial discomfort by emphasizing:

<br>Sexuality is a normal and natural element of human existence
<br>Sexual health often has important implications for clients' mental health and may assist the counselor in providing holistic and informed mental healthcare
<br>Clients are free to answer only those questions that they feel comfortable answering, and they are also welcome to respond at a later time. 


<br><br>
<br>Following an intersystemic framework, counselors can approach sexual assessment systematically and contextually. 

<br>An intersectional systemic approach, 'balances attention to the individual, couple, and family system, as well as the larger systems in which we live.'
<br>This framework outlines the five domains impacting client sexual wellness:

<br>Individual-biological/medical
<br>Individual-psychologic
<br>Dyadic relationship or couple dynamics
<br>Intergenerational influences
<br>Contextual factors such as society, culture, history, religion, and physical/geographic environment. 




<br><br>
<br>The first level of assessment, individual-biological/medical, is aimed at understanding what if any, underlying biological and/or medical issues might be causing the sexual issue, including causes related to natural aging and developmental hormonal changes. 

<br>People who have recently given birth may experience hormonal shifts that limit sexual desire, which may also be connected to culturally deprived beliefs about sexuality and motherhood related to reduced sexual drive. Examples include: 

<br>Do you currently have any physical issues and/or medical conditions? How has this impacted your sexual wellness and functioning?
<br>Are you currently taking any medications? What affect, if any, does this medication ahve on your sexual wellness and functioning?
<br>Has disability impacted your sexual wellness? If so, how?
<br>How has your sexual wellness and functioning changed as you have aged?




<br>Even if no medical/biological issue is reported, referral to a medical doctor or sexual health specialist (if the client has not done so already) is advised if sexual issues are present that appear to be biologically/physiologically based. 
<br><br>
<br>The second level of assessment is individual-psychologic, which assesses potential psychological factors for sexual dysfunction, including comorbidity with existing and prior mental health issues. 
<br>Psychotropic medications used to treat mental health issues can also interrupt sexual functioning. 

<br>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., SSRIs) have been shown to further induce sexual side effects, such as lowered libido, and arousal/orgasm difficulties. 


<br>Assessment questions of the psychologic dynamics of sexual dysfunction include:

<br>Have you previously experienced mental health issues? If so, what was the impact of those issues on your sexual wellness?
<br>How does your mood typically impact your libido and sexual functioning?
<br>When you feel (client's mental health symptoms), how does that tend to impact your sexual well-being? How, if at all, does your sexual desire and ability to experience pleasure shift when your symptoms are at their worst?


<br>Over the course of treatment, it is recommended to regularly monitor any changes in the client's sexual function as an additional point of insight into the client's overall mental health, as well as to establish a timeline of the sexual problem. 
<br><br>
<br>The counselor will assess the relational dynamics of the sexual issue, which includes relational attachment, conflict history, communication, intimacy, and the presence of intimate partner violence (IPV). 
<br>The goals of relational assessment are for the client(s) and counselor to explore how the dynamics of the relationship may be contributing to the sexual issue, as well as how each individual partner is coping with the presence of sexual difficulties.

<br>Common areas to explore include the client's sexual history with their current partner, communication strategies used by the client(s) when discussing sexual issues with their partners, and patterns of initiating, negotiating, and engaging in sexual activities. 


<br>A sexual history assessment may also be a helpful tool in discovering the couple's shared and individual levels of sexual knowledge, communication patterns, and sexual desires/interests.
<br>Example items for sexual history assessment include:

<br>How did you first become sexually intimate with your partner? How would you describe your initial sexual connection? How has this changed over time?
<br>What types of sexual activities do you and your partner engage in?
<br>What types of partners and solo activities give you the most pleasure?
<br>How would you like to see your sexual relationships change or grow?
<br>How is sex initiated in your relationship? How do each of you respond when you're interested in sex, but your partner isn't?
<br>How do you communicate your sexual needs and desires to your partner?
<br>What challenges do you face, if any, in talking to your partner about sex?


<br>The sexual worldview of individuals in a relationship may also have significant impacts on the quality of sex in the relationship, as well as the quality of the total relationship. Sexual problems can cause physical and emotional distress, shame, and embarrassment during sexual encounters, which can inhibit the level of satisfaction and pleasure derived by all partners. 

<br>How do you feel when you're experiencing the sexual issue?
<br>How does your partner respond to you when you're experiencing the sexual issue?
<br>What are your major fears or insecurities about this issue?
<br>How, if at all, are these fears related messages you received about gender/race/sexuality growing up? 


<br>An imbalance of power (e.g., physical, emotional, financial, and/or childcare responsibilities) in the relationship can create challenges to the development of trust and intimacy, which can affect the sexual relationship and can further affect the individual's sexual functioning. 
<br>Before addressing the sexual wellbeing of the relationship, existing violence and/or severe conflict would first need to be addressed. 

<br>Example items to assess the presence of relational distress and violence include:

<br>How do you typically address, navigate, and resolve conflict in your relationship?
<br>How does your relationship typically handle jealousy, anger, and resentment?
<br>When, if ever, have you experienced physical or emotional violence in your relationship?
<br>How does conflict tend to impact your sexual relationship with your partner?

<br>The genogram allows the couple to understand the sexual issue from a more contextual and systemic perspective, which can initiate new, more functional patterns of relating. In this way, the genogram is both an assessment tool and an intervention strategy (McGoldrick, 2008)


<br>Questions on the sexual genogram focus on six core areas:

<br>Messages received about sexuality/intimacy and gender
<br>Communication and behaviors related to sexuality
<br>Sexual secrets
<br>Lacking information
<br>Each partner's response to the other's genogram
<br>Goals for growth in the client's/couple's genogram. 


<br>Sample items to include on the sexual genogram include:

<br>How did you first learn about sexuality?
<br>How do members of your family, community, and cultural background(s) tend to view sexuality?
<br>How did your caregivers and family members respond to your sexual development (e.g., secondary sex characteristics, masturbation, first dating experiences, and access to safer sex/family planning resources)?
<br>Are there sexual events that are silenced or not talked about in your family-of-origin?
<br>Have you previously experienced difficulties with your arousal or orgasm?
<br>How have these difficulties impacted you and your partner(s)?
<br>How do you feel about the look, smell, and taste of your genitals? How does this impact your sexual connection with your partner(s)?
<br>What is the meaning/purpose of sex for you?




<br><br>
<br>The goals of this final level of assessment are for the client to gain awareness of impact of cultural values on their sexual wellness, as well as to affirm the unique resiliencies the client has developed in response to these overarching systems. 
<br>Example items to include in the contextual assessment:

<br>How, if at all, did religion impact your understanding of sexuality growing up? How about your cultural backgrounds?
<br>Which of your identities are most salient to you? What assumptions/expectations exist for each of your identities with respect to sex (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc.)?
<br>How do members of your cultural background tend to view sex and gender? Masturbation? Sexual pleasure?
<br>In what ways, if at all, have you felt like your sexual well-being was limited because of your identities?
<br>What sexuality supports do you wish you had received as a young person?
<br>What changes have you made to your personal understanding of sexuality throughout your life? What is most empowering about your current sexual worldview?


<br>Often when clients simply articulate the unspoken limitations of sex-negative value systems on their lives, they are empowered to update these perspectives in ways that are more congruent with their current ethical framework. 
<br><br>
<br>A primary aim of family systems counseling is for the client to glean new insights into the relational dynamics in their life and to subsequently feel empowered to shift the boundaries, attachments, and communication patterns of those relationships that are not actively serving the client's mental and sexual wellness. 
<br>The PLISSIT model describes four levels of care ranging from introductory to specialized - Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, and Intensive Therapy - which can be applied to client. 

<br>The first level of care, permission, describes the counselor's role in giving the client express permission to discuss sexual issues in counseling, while emphasizing that sexuality is a normal, natural, and worthwhile topic of examination throughout a person's life. 

<br>Permission-giving is intended to affirm clients' sexual well-being, destigmatize sexual discussion, and invite continued and ongoing sexual exploration throughout treatment.


<br>Often limited information is needed in order to provide the client with additional knowledge related to their specific sexual issue (i.e., psychoeducation).
<br>Specific Suggestions may be required to improve the issue, such as giving a client a homework assignment to view their genitals in the mirror, practice sensate focus with their partner, or engage in a series of nonsexual touch exercises with their partner in the counseling office. (Counselors are recommended to join sexuality-specific organizations for additional learning opportunities such as the Association for Counseling Sexology and Sexual Wellness (ACSSW) and the American Association for Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT))
<br>The final level of care, intensive therapy, ins indicated in situations when the client is not finding relief from previous levels of treatment, which often signals comorbidity with underlying trauma, mental illness, and/or addiction issues. The need for intensive therapy may also prompt referral to a certified sex therapist, sexologist, or some other sexual healthcare. 
<br>PLISSIT is not used in lieu of an evidence-based treatment approach, but rather as a supplemental directive informing the progression of treatment. 


<br><br>
<br>Sexual assessment should be invitational, responsive to the client's cultural background and comfort level, and expressly relevant to the client's presenting issues. Questions based on the counselor's personal, nontherapeutic curiosity should be avoided.
<br><a data-href="University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">University Resources/Couple and Family Therapy/Keywords/Countertransference</a> can occur when a client brings up a topic that has personal resonance with the counselor and in situations where the client or client's situation reminds the counselor of someone/something in their own life.

<br>Countertransference is a normative experience for counselors; however, the counselor's initial awareness of countertransference must be followed up with consultation, supervision, personal therapy, and/or continued education in order to prevent personal reactions from further impacting the therapeutic process.
<br>Arousal can be a naturally occurring response to sexual discussion; however, it is important for the client and counselor to adhere to clear boundaries if arousal/attraction occurs. 

<br>"Sexual discussion can often stir up a wide range of confusing and exciting emotions. Maintaining a professional counselor-client relationship is critical in keeping this space safe and sacred for you. "
<br>"I am getting the sense that this conversation is exciting you right now. While that can be a common response to sharing intimate sexual details, I want to remind you of our professional boundaries. If you need a break from this conversation, you are welcome to step outside, grab some water, or reschedule for a later time."




<br>The importance of normalizing the existence of client attraction and focusing on creating opportunities aimed at supporting counselors as they establish and uphold boundaries, process 'forbidden' feelings, and practice enhanced bracketing skills with a peer or supervisor. 
<br>Counselors must clearly communicate goals, priorities, and rationale for the decision to apply a sexual dysfunction diagnosis, as well as facilitate an informed discussion of the risks associated with sharing a diagnosis with an outside source, such as a health insurance company or in the case of a judicial subpoena. 

<br>Before the client consents to formal diagnosis for healthcare coverage reasons, the counselor and client must collaboratively weight out the benefits and limitations of this formal documentation.

<br>Identity is shaped by multiple factors

<br>Individual characteristics
<br>Family dynamics
<br>Historical factors
<br>Social and political context


<br>Much of my identity is determined by who the world around me says that I am?

<br>(i.e. Who do my parents, peers, teachers, neighbors, the media, the culture say that I am?)


<br>'The looking glass self' Charles Cooley

<br>Other people are the mirror by which I see myself
<br>This is a multidimensional reflection of myself


<br>The social, cultural, and historical context is the ground in which individual identity is embedded - Erik Erickson

<br>Identity formation is a process 'located within the core of the individual and yet in the core of their communal culture'


<br>We must then integrate our past, present, and future into a cohesive unified self over the life course.

<br>In the US, there are several categories of 'otherness' commonly experienced by people in our society. 
<br>These categories are based on the following characteristics:

<br>Race or ethnicity
<br>Gender
<br>Religion
<br>Sexual orientation
<br>Socioeconomic status
<br>Age
<br>Physical or mental ability


<br>In relation to otherness there is always a form of oppression connected to the various categories (i.e. racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, etc.)

<br>In every case there is a group considered dominant - systemically advantaged by society and a group considered subordinate or targeted (systemically disadvantaged)

<br>Inequitable social relationships are seen as the model for 'normal human relationships'

<br>I am from... (place, landscape, familiar, sights, smells growing up)
<br>I am from (traditions, music you remember growing up)
<br>I am from (ancestors, relatives, people in your life now, nonviolence heroes and sheroes)

<br>Multicultural counseling and therapy can be defined as both a helping role and a process that uses modalities and defines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients; recognizes client identities to include individual, group, and universal dimensions; advocates the use of universal and culture-specific stratefies and roles in the helping process; and balances the importance of individualism and collectivism in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of client and client systems.

<br>Any oppressive system has the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group.
<br><br>
<br>The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society. 
<br>Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional.
<br><br>
<br>The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. 

<br>Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal.


<br><br>
<br>The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. 
<br>Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. 
<br>On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change.
<br><br>
<br>The -isms all work to establish a defined norm or standard of rightness under which everyone is judged. 
<br>This defined norm is backed up with individual and institutional violence which makes the oppression possible. 
<br>The defined norm is a notion that all of us might accept and promote for various reasons probably connected to a sense of inferiority or economic vulnerability. 
<br><br>
<br>'Whiteness as Poverty' argues that law has come to embody and legitimize benefits that accrue to citizens just because they are right. 

<br>Despite the end to formal racial discrimination in the legal system race matters in how the law is carried out. 


<br>Due to the embedded racism in American society, Whiteness can be considered a property interest. 

<br>Right of Possession
<br>Right to Use and Enjoyment
<br>Right to Disposition
<br>Right of Exclusion


<br>Critics of Harris' argument suggest that distributive justice sets up harm for the dominant group (in this case whites). 

<br>Harris argues, "Acknowledging Black identity does not involve the systematic subordination of whites, nor does it even set up a danger of doing so."

<br>Giving everyone what they need to be successful (may appear unfair)


<br><br>
<br>A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. 
<br>Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. 
<br>Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. 
<br>This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
<br>For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development. 
<br><br>
<br>This occurs when social structures that create and organize different social groups, e.g., gender and race, interact to produce effects that may not be intended. 

<br>Example:

<br>Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. 

<br>Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment. 






<br><br>
<br>This occurs when the political movements working towards justice for different groups, e.g., feminism and antiracism, interact to exclude or marginalize the interests of some subset of the groups, or reinforced another form of injustice. 
<br>Examples:

<br>For women of color anti-racist and feminist political agendas often conflict with one another
<br>This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. 


<br>Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. 

<br>Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism.


<br><br>
<br>A concept that refers to the cultural construction of an identity, including the production and the contemporary critiques of the identity. 
<br>This occurs when images or tropes are taken to be representative of the group ignore or distort the complexity of the group. 
<br>"Representational intersectionality would include both the ways in which these images are produced through a confluence of prevalent narrative of race and gender, as well as the recognition of how contemporary critiques of racist and sexist representations marginalize women of color." (<a data-href="@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@crenshawMappingMarginsIntersectionality1991</a>, p. 1283)
<br><br>
<br>The experience of being a member of more than one social group that cannot be decomposed into the experience of being a member of each. 

<br>Example:

<br>The experience of being a Black woman is not just the experience of being Black and the experience of being a woman. 
<br>The experience of being a Black woman is a proper compound of the two.




<br><br>
<br>Critical Race Theory (CRT) states that, 'Racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental categorization, attitude and discourse.' (Stefancic and Delgado, 2012, p. 21) and it challenges the 'ontological and epistemological biases subtly inculcated in the law, policies, or in empirical research that would otherwise hinter contextualization of harm and dysfunction resulting from racial stratification.' (Brown, 2003, p. 294)
<br><br>
<br>CRT helps focus our attention on the recursive interactions between institutionalized and interpersonal discrimination. 
<br>Through the application of CRT to counseling and psychotherapy it is possible to interrogate the Eurocentric, ethnocentric and individualistic ways in which mental health practices are undertaken. 
<br>Clients in need of psychological support can then be given a safe space for them to explore (in their own vernacular if necessary) their experiences of living in a capitalistic, racist, and misogynistic world.

<br>Allow and encourage the free and open expression of emotion. 
<br>View each member as having a right to be their own unique self (individuate from the emotional field of the family). 
<br>Strive for an equal division of labor among family members. 
<br>Consider egalitarian role relationships between partners desirable. 
<br>Hold the nuclear family as the standard.

<br>Non-verbal communication tends not to be under conscious control.

<br>The aim is to deepen engagement and mutual understanding in hopes of working and healing together. 
<br>Informed by evidenced-based theories and tools, the KCCM emphasizes the following:

<br>Understanding barriers to constructive conversations
<br>Self-awareness and regulation
<br>Values as anchors
<br>Personal skills development
<br>Healing in relationship connection


<br>The KCCM

<br>Goal
<br>Barriers
<br>Values
<br>Openers
<br>Take Action
<br>Listen
<br>Respond
<br>Repeat


<br><br><br>
<br>Use both clinician skill and client perspective to understand the problem
<br>Collaborate and jointly define the problem. 
<br>Jointly formulate a hypothesis regarding the cause of the problem. 
<br>Jointly develop ways to confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis on the problem, continuing to consider alternative hypotheses. 
<br>Test out the hypothesis using both the client and the therapist as evaluators. 
<br>If the conceptualization appears to be valid, develop a treatment plan. 
<br>If the hypothesis is not borne out, jointly collect additional data and formulate new, testable hypotheses. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Deliberate practice is individualized training activities specially designed by a coach or teacher to improve specific aspects of an individual's performance through repetition and successive refinement. 
<br>Deliberate practice is an evidenced-based method of skill development.
<br>Deliberate practice works best when training targets each student's personal skill thresholds or current ability. If a deliberate practice exercise is either too easy or too hard, the student is unlikely to benefit from it.
<br>To maximize training productivity, performers follow a 'challenging but not overwhelming' training principle. 
<br>This means that deliberate practice requires ongoing assessment of the student's current skill and tailoring the difficulty of exercises to consistently target a 'good enough' challenge. 
<br>Skill Criteria for Attention to Diversity

<br>Convey a brief empathic response to a client/family member that indicates you hear their problem or the session content. 
<br>Reflect on the problem/session content, looking for opportunities to deepen the conversation as it relates to their identity and unique experiences. 
<br>Ask a question that conveys continued empathy and curiosity about their identity and unique experiences with the problem.

<br>Requires us to acknowledge positions of privilege and marginalization in the room. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Potential Barriers:

<br>In general, therapists are less religious than their clients and the population at large. 
<br>There is a historic divide between science (psychology) and religion
<br>In the United States there is a desire to maintain separation between church and state
<br>Some therapists avoid the topic to avoid imposing their own beliefs
<br>Some therapists lack confidence in how to address religion and spirituality ethically and effectively. 


<br><br>
<br>An organized system of beliefs, rituals, practices, and community, oriented toward the sacred. 
<br>Tends to focus on formal organizations with specifically defined and widely accepted beliefs, practices, and traditions. 
<br><br>
<br>Transcendent beliefs and practices lived out in daily life and relationships. 
<br>It can be experienced outside religious structure. 
<br>"A process through which people seek to discover, hold on to, and when necessary, transform whatever they hold sacred in their lives."
<br><br>
<br>Spiritually integrated psychotherapy is based on findings in psychotherapy research and the psychology of religion. 
<br>It is the practice of purposefully assessing clients' spiritual/religious belief systems and worldviews in the context of psychotherapy, while integrating spiritually oriented interventions. 
<br><br>
<br>Clinical
<br>Spiritual
<br>Moral
<br><br><br>
<br>Any inquiry about topics commonly related to spiritual themes (i.e., meaning making, coping, social support, and morality)

<br>Explore client's worldview and/or personal philosophies
<br>Listen for client's use of 'spiritually laden' words
<br>Explore client's current experience of congruence


<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge client's spontaneous statements of spiritual beliefs' 
<br>Inquire about their spiritual beliefs and practices
<br>Inquire about how they connect spiritual, clinical, and moral dimensions of life. 
<br>Express agreement with the client's spiritual beliefs or sensibilities when such self-disclosure could be therapeutic. 
<br>Articulate client's dilemma without giving your own position. 
<br>Point out contradictions between the client's beliefs and clinical realities or moral issues. 
<br>Challenge the client's way of handling spiritual beliefs based on your own spiritual, moral, or clinical beliefs.
<br><br>
<br>Any method of direct inquiry about a client's spirituality or religion. 
<br><br>
<br>The purpose of spiritual reflection is twofold:

<br>Understand ourselves in our work with clients
<br>Understand clients from their own point-of-view


<br>Increasing our understanding helps us fulfill the role of spiritually integrated therapists by not placing our beliefs and/or bias onto the client. 
<br>Questions to consider:

<br>How are these clients encountering a search for meaning?
<br>How do these clients and their presenting problem represent a theme from religious tradition or spiritual worldview (e.g., hope, reconciliation, pillars of faith)
<br>Regarding this case, what is an experience of the sacred/divine/spirit?


<br><br>
<br>Spirituality and religion as distinctive concepts
<br>Ethical implications of integration religion and spirituality in practice
<br>Start with a strong understanding of one's own social location

<br>'Indigenous' describes any group of people native to a specific region. In other words, it refers to people who lived there before colonists or settlers arrived, defined new borders, and began to occupy the land. 
<br>The term 'indigeneity' has emerged to describe the state of being indigenous or related to Indigenous-ness. 
<br>There are over 476 million indigenous people living in 90 countries across the world, accounting for 6.2% of the global population: Of those, there are more than 5,000 distinct groups. 
<br><br>
<br>Healing-informed care is care based on Indigenous wisdom about wellness and what is  necessary to heal. 

<br>Balance
<br>Relational
<br>Strength-based


<br>Healing has been defined as 'transition toward meaning, wholeness, connectedness, and balance.'
<br><br>
<br>Holistic:

<br>Interconnectedness underlies all of human experience


<br>Balance:

<br>Because of the interdependencies of all life, achieving and maintaining balance is important both to the individual and the larger group. 


<br>Moral Code:

<br>The physical and metaphysical worlds are linked to a moral code. 


<br>Respect:

<br>Respect of all living things and each other is essential for balance.

<br><br>
<br>White feminist lens (i.e., White binary, heterosexual perspective, Patriarchy, and sexism)
<br><br>
<br>Postmodern approach to gender (still binary and biologically determined)
<br><br>
<br>Fmaily therapy theory rests on normative concepts of the traditional family and idealized conceptions of family relationships. Inequalities in the family associated with gender have been regarded as of little importance to the development of macro theory in the field. The two most influential therapeutic models, psychodynamic and systemic approaches, are each marked by gender bias. 
<br><br>
<br>Feminist therapy is an integrative approach to psychotherapy that focused on the challenges that women face as a result of bias, stereotyping, oppression, discrimination, and other factors, and how those stressors can negatively affect their mental health. 
<br>'Feminist Family Therapy is the application of feminist theory and values to family therapy.'
<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge and examine the roles of values in therapy for both the therapist and the client (s).
<br>Intentionally introduce a discussion of gender into the therapy process using clinical language and techinques that acknowledge experiences across genders. 
<br>Assess power inequalities in relationships rather than assuming equity in relationships. 
<br>Include discussion of individual choice and responsibility in conceptualizations of family dynamics. 
<br>Honor and appreciate the diversity inherent to families. 
<br>Consider the clinical implications of interventions on both the family and on individual members of the family. 
<br>Work actively to reduce power inequalities between therapist and client. (Leslie &amp; Southard 2009)
<br><br>
<br>According to intersectional feminists, there is not enough emphasis on the intersection of patriarchy with other factors, such as race, religion, and class. 
<br>Intersectional feminists argue that other types of feminism assume that all women are exploited in the same way in the family.

<br><br>
<br>Read peer-reviewed published literature to provide best support and understand terminology. 
<br>Recognize the family as a key protective factor in mental health outcomes of TGNDB children and work with the whole system. 
<br>Use the pronouns and name the young person requests you use. This may include checking in at each session and using a different name and pronoun when their family is present if this is more comfortable for them. 
<br>Explore the power in the system and the political climate in which you are seeing a TGNDB person. 

<br>Example: Be aware of news articles or the area the person lives in to check about transphobic experiences and/or discrimination


<br>Connect TGDNB young people to community and peers to build their sense of connection and reduce stigma and isolation

<br>Therapist will need to each out to local services and be aware of local networks
<br>This can include online community connection

<br>A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. 
<br>Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
<br>Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. 
<br>We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. 
<br>While the 13 th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. 
<br>We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. 
<br>We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries.  
<br>We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community.  
<br>We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
<br>We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. 
<br>We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them. 
<br><br>
<br>What is the presenting problem?
<br>Indicate if there are 'identified patient (s)'
<br>Who initiated contact and why?
<br><br><br>
<br>In 2022, there were roughly 47.9 million individuals who self-identified as Black (14.4% of the U.S. population)
<br>Black Americans are diverse, presenting through the lens of four groups:

<br>Total US Black population
<br>Single-race, non-Hispanic Black people
<br>Multiracial, non-Hispanic Black people
<br>Black Hispanic people


<br><br>
<br>Help-Seeking refers to the process of finding support for dealing with relationship distress that occurs between couples. 

<br>Professional help:

<br>Couples therapy is an evidence-based approach to improve marital quality, yet there are hesitancies and barriers to treatment. 
<br>Other sources:

<br>Friends
<br>Family
<br>Church






<br><br>
<br>Relationship distress amongst spouses/partners

<br>'Different state from the usual ups and downs of a marriage'
<br>Feeling fundamentally dissatisfied with the relationship
<br>Constant
<br>Features of contempt, withdrawal, violence, and loss of connection
<br>Impacts individual and the system

<br>Feeling dissatisfied, upset, 'trapped', stuck in a perpetual cycle, desperate for change


<br>Looks different between all couples

<br>Broader term


<br>Ultimately, unresolved relationship distress can lead to the dissolution of the relationship. 


<br><br>
<br>Black Shadow:

<br>'Internalized myth of Black inferiority that has conceived and propagated by slaveowners to justify the enslavement of African people more than 400 years ago'
<br>Systematic racism has perpetuated these beliefs, promoting White superiority and Black inferiority
<br>'Systems of Power' highlights two states:

<br>Have
<br>Have nots
<br>Social hierarchy
<br>Some people have advantages, and some have disadvantages




<br>Remember:

<br>Ignoring slavery and the history of our country disempowers African Americans


<br><br>
<br>African American couples experience worse relationship quality and are less likely than other ethnic groups to seek professional help
<br>Face unique barriers:

<br>Stigma
<br>Representation
<br>Power Dynamics


<br>Mistrust and racism is not a 'past' system or issue
<br><br>
<br>Vaterlaus et al (2015)

<br>Prior to Treatment

<br>Stigma

<br>'Weakness' (most significant deterrent)


<br>Concerns for cultural sensitivity
<br>Financial inability to pay




<br>Hubbard et al (2024)

<br>During Treatment

<br>Discrimination
<br>Microaggressions
<br>Fears of misdiagnosis

<br>"African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, while mood disorders often go underdiagnosed."






<br><br>
<br>Mussa et al (2023) point out that newlywed African American couples tend ot seek help in alternative ways:

<br>Help from God (prayer)
<br>Religious leaders
<br>Friends
<br>Family members


<br>Hubbard et al. (2024)

<br>'The Black church,' along with friends and family

<br>Black churches emerged furing the time of slavery
<br>History of being a 'safe place' to express cultural heritage, develop community, and organize structure
<br>Entry point for mental health care

 <br><br><br>
<br>People age 65+ = 16% of the population in 2019 (51.1 million)

<br>Expected to be 21.6% by 2040. 


<br>Nearly 1 in 4 older adults were members of a racial/ethnic minority population:

<br>African American (not Hispanic): 12%
<br>Asian American (not Hispanic): 13%
<br>Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (not Hispanic): 10%
<br>American Indian and Alaska Native (not Hispanic): 12%
<br>Hispanic: 8%
<br>Persons identifying as two or more groups: 6%


<br><br>
<br>In Ohio persons 65+ represented 17.51% of the population (2,046,320)
<br>This represents a 27.31% increase from 2009-2019. 
<br>8.3% of persons 65+ in Ohio live below the poverty line. 
<br><br>
<br>In 2020, a larger percentage of older men (70%) than older women (48%) were married. 
<br>Of older adults age 65+ living in the community, 61% lived with their spouse/partner in 2020. 

<br>About 27% lived alone


<br>The 2019 median income of older persons was $27,398 ($36, 921 for men and $21,815 for women)
<br>In 2019, 4.9 million people age 65+ lived below the poverty level. 

<br>Another 2.6 million were 'near-poor'


<br>The median household income of older homeowners was $36,200 in 2019. 
<br>In 2020, 9.8 million Americans age 65+ were in the labor force (working or actively seeking work). 
<br>Consumers age 65+ averaged out-of-pocket health care expenditures of $6,833 in 2019, up 41% from 2009. 
<br>In 2019, about 1.1 million people age 60+ were responsible for the basic needs of at least one grandchild under age 18 living with them. 
<br>During COVID-19, between March and April 2020, the unemployment rate for adults age 65+ more than quadrupled. 
<br><br>
<br>Negative stereotypes and discrimination (ageism)
<br>Mental deterioration

<br>Some cognitive slowing is associated with normal aging (e.g., periodic minor memory difficulties, such as forgetting names or phone numbers or misplacing objects)
<br>About 1 in 7 adults 71+ have dementia

<br>Alzheimer disease




<br>Elder abuse and neglect
<br>Substance abuse
<br>Social isolation, depression, and suicidality
<br><br>
<br>Please identify the following for Older Adults:

<br>Characteristics
<br>Strengths
<br>Ethnic or Cultural Values


<br><br>
<br>What emotional stressors are specific to older adults? What are possible ways to support the client in feeling with these emotional stressors? 
<br>How can we think about care with older adults as suicide prevention?
<br>As clinicians, what can we do to address the physical limitations that an older adult client may face to make sure these challenges do not impede the treatment process?
<br><br><br>
<br>26% of adults in the US have some types of disability (61 million)
<br>2 in 5 adults age 65 years and older have a disability
<br>1 in 4 women have a disability
<br>2 in 5 non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaskan Natives have a disability
<br>Adults living with disabilities are more likely to be obese, smoke, and have heart disease and diabetes. 
<br>1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years do not have a usual health care provider
<br>1 in 3 adults with disabilities 18 to 44 years have an unmet healthcare need because of cost in the past year
<br>1 in 4 adults with disabilities 45 to 64 years did not have a routine check-up in the past year. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Over 3 million children (4.3% of the under-18 population) in the US had a disability in 2019. 
<br>The most common disability type among children both years was cognitive difficulty
<br>American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) children had the highest rate of childhood disability of all racial groups, at 5.9% in 2019.
<br><br><br>
<br>In the moral model (or religious), disability is seen as having meaning about the person's or family's character, deeds, thoughts, and karma. 
<br>From this perspective, disability can carry stigma, shame and blame, particularly if the disability is seen as a mark of wrongdoing. 
<br>It can also be seen as a sign of honor, faith, or strength (although this is less common)
<br>The moral model is very prevalent worldwide and is often depicted in the media
<br><br>
<br>The Medical model views disability as resulting from an individual person's physical or mental limitations
<br>The Medical Model focuses on find a 'cure' or making a person more 'normal'
<br>The Medical Model uses the terms 'Disability,' 'Disease,' 'Dysfunctional,' 'Disorder' to categorize type of symptoms, differences in mechanisms, below average based on standardized measure of functioning, that causes challenges in life. 
<br>“Pasted image 20240410205740.jpg” could not be found.
<br><br>
<br>This model 'proposes that what makes someone disabled is not their medical condition, but the attitudes and structures of society. It is a civil rights approach to disability.'
<br>If modern life was set up in a way that was accessible for people then they would not be excluded or restricted
<br><img alt="43271604940_a621c6995d_o.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/43271604940_a621c6995d_o.png">
<br><br>
<br>Based on basic human rights principles, "It recognizes that disability is a natural part of human diversity that must be respected and support in all its forms.
<br>People with disability have the same rights as everyone else in society," and disability, "must not be used as an excuse to deny or restrict people's rights"
<br><br>
<br>Using both models, we can begin to see people with disabilities correctly: as human. 
<br>We must consider how we can become better allies for individuals with disabilities by ensuring that society is accessible (Social Model)
<br>We must examine how we interact with and view people with disabilities.. 
<br>We must ensure that our policies and practices support the Human Rights Model and encourage full inclusion and participation for individuals with disabilities
<br>Therapist make the environment comfortable for their clients.

<br>Is the caregiver noticing behavioral disturbances? Are they noticing physical signs? Changes to cyclical behaviors?


<br>Discuss with caregiver concerns of possible depression, "I'm concerned you may be experiencing depression, let's find a provider that specializes in working with older adults."

<br>How to start conversation when concerned

<br>Start conversation in calm, straight-forward, compassionate way
<br>Describe what you observed
<br>Can I help you connect with people who can help?




<br><br>
<br>Due to added caregiving responsibilities that are necessary for individuals with disabilities, members of families affected by disabilities have an increased prevalence of physical, psychological, and relational distress. 
<br>Parents, spouses, and siblings of children with disabilities experience higher rates of mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression. 

<br>Caregivers have higher rates of health problems and reports a variety of physical symptoms such as migraines, heart conditions, and sleep problems. The mental and physical health effects lead to reports of decreased quality of life and general wellbeing. 


<br><br>
<br>Many of the adverse physical, mental, and relational health effects described by family members of individuals with disabilities are compounded by a lack of social support. Families often explain that there is a notable deficit in available social support, which they generally attribute to two main reasons: 

<br>Family members’ lack of free time to socialize with friends and family due to the added caregiving responsibilities
<br>Societal stigma associated with disabilities that may be attributed to personal shame and embarrassment of family members or the disapproval and ostracization by others


<br>Clinicians working with families affected by disabilities can support caregivers by connecting them with appropriate online platforms to increase social support, which acts as a protective factor against the harmful effects of caregiver stress and burnout.

<br><br>"A leading text for courses that go beyond the basics of family systems theory, intervention techniques, and diversity, this influential work has now been significantly revised with 65% new material. The volume explores how family relationships--and therapy itself--are profoundly shaped by race, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other intersecting dimensions of marginalization and privilege. Chapters from leading experts guide the practitioner to challenge assumptions about family health and pathology, understand the psychosocial impact of oppression, and tap into clients' cultural resources for healing. Practical clinical strategies are interwoven with theoretical insights, case examples, training ideas, and therapists' reflections on their own cultural and family legacies"-- Provided by publisher<br><br>

<br><br>"For over four decades, Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice (CCD) has been considered the "gold standard" in culturally competent mental health care. Its cutting-edge presentation of multicultural counseling and therapy (MCT) is used in an overwhelming majority of graduate training programs in counseling and clinical psychology, and it has produced generations of culturally sensitive mental health practitioners. It now forms the multicultural knowledge base of licensing and certification exams at both the masters and the doctoral levels in psychology. In 2021, Social Science Space identified the book as one of the most important works across social science disciplines that has contributed to the ongoing need to understand, analyze, resist, and dismantle racism, bias, and bigotry. In essence, CCD has become a "classic" in the field of mental health practice, and leads the profession in the theory, research, and practice of MCT. CCD upholds the highest standards of scholarship, and is the most frequently cited source in multicultural psychology and mental health. The expert and global perspectives of the four co-authors, each active researchers and practitioners in the field, strengthen the newly minted ninth edition of CCD. As a result, instructors will note the continued fresh, scholarly, and exciting perspective in the content of CCD, as it continues to rank as the most up-to- date text in the field"--<br><br>

The idea of first year student being paired up with a second year therapist to help guide. 

<br>
Working with agencies?

<br>
No surprises act: Giving clients an estimate about how much they are going to pay for services

<br>
Struggle with terminating services. As long as file is open, you are legally their therapist. Case is closed because once the case is closed you are no longer their therapist. They can always come back. 

<br>What will be different for you when we are ready to move on? What does it need to be life for this to end? We make a mistake of not planting that seed early on. 

<br>When clients start thinking of me as a person, such as asking questions. When you are no longer in the therapist role, when you stop becoming a person's therapist and become a person to them. They begin to see you as yourself rather than a therapist. 
<br>If you have not scheduled within 30 days, we would terminate and close their case. They can always call back. 




<br>


<br>Purpose of accreditation: 

<br>Ensure the quality of marriage and family therapy programs. 
<br>Accredited programs meet or exceed all standards for accreditation. 


<br>Standards for Accreditation: Version 12.5

<br>Outcome Based Education (You have to show that your people are meeting target): Vs input based (You offer these courses, your people are confident). 
<br>360 Quality and Improvement Review Process
<br>Start with Program goals, then student learning outcomes, and then targets for those outcomes. 
<br>Review and gather data to show that you are meeting the targets or not and what you are doing to change the program to allow students to meet the SLO's




<br>


<br>If programs are accredited, licensure boards typically accept that they meet the educational requirements and client contact contact hour requirements for licensure (again, typically, always check with the state board)

<br>State of Ohio -&gt; 500 hour requirement
<br>Board -&gt; 300 hour requirement


<br>Set standards for what adequate education and training is in the field. Protect students in those programs, knowing that they are able to be licensed in their state with that education, and protects the public in general, knowing that a therapist who graduated from an accredited program has the education and training needed to provide the service. 


<br>


<br>Legal Age for Marriage in Ohio:

<br>16

<br>What are the Marriage Age Requirement Laws in Ohio?

<br>While females in Ohio may get married as young as 16 with the consent of both parents, only a juvenile court (in limiting cases) may consent to a marriage involving a male under 18. 






<br>Same-sex marriage has been 'legal' and recognized in Ohio since 2015. 
<br>Parentage:

<br>A man is presumed to be the natural father of a child in certain circumstances, including:

<br>The man and the child's mother are or have been married to each other, and the child is born during the marriage or is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated.
<br>An acknowledgement of paternity has been filed pursuant to Sec. 3111.23
<br>The term 'Punative Father' means a man, including one under age 18, who may be a child's father and to whom all of the following apply. 

<br>He is not married to the child's mother at the time of the child's conception or birth. 
<br>He has not adopted the child.

<br>He has not acknowledged paternity of the child pursuant to Sec. 3111.21 to 3111.35.








<br>


<br>Understanding Divorce and Custody Issues:

<br>Dissolution vs. Divorce:

<br>Dissolution is when both parties can agree on all matters pertaining to separation (i.e., no fault divorce).
<br>Divorce is when both parties can't come to an agreement.




<br>To get a no-fault divorce, you need to state in the Complaint for Divorce that 'that the parties are incompatible,' or 'the parties have been living separate and apart without cohabitation for 1 year.' The grounds of being incompatible can be defeated if your spouse denies incompatibility.
<br>The fault-based grounds for divorce are bigamy, willful absence of the other party for 1 year, adultery, extreme cruelty, fraudulent contract, gross neglect of duty, habitual drunkness, imprisonment in a state or federal prison at the time of filing, and when the divorce decree of another state does not use any of these, since they had complexity to the process by requiring proof. 


<br>


<br>If parties don't agree about custody agreements, the judge will decide based on child's best interest:

<br>The wishes of the parties,
<br>The wishes of the child, if the judge interviewed the child in private, 
<br>The child's adjustment to home, school, and community,
<br>The mental and physical health of all persons involved, 

<br>You may get subpoenaed, good idea to contact attorney and ask. If private practice, have attorney on retainer,


<br>The party more likely to honor and facilitate parenting time rights,
<br>Whether either party failed to make all child support payments, including arrearages,
<br>Whether either party or a household member was a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect, or a violent or sexually oriented offense involving a member of the family,
<br>Whether either party has continuously and willfully, denied the other party's rights to parenting time in accordance with an an order of the court,
<br>Whether either party has, or has plans to, establish a residence outside of Ohio. 


<br>Other Considerations:

<br>The ability of the parties to cooperate and make decisions jointly,
<br>Each party's ability to encourage contact between the child and the other party,
<br>Any history of, or potential for, child abuse, domestic violence, or parental kidnapping,
<br>The geographic proximity of the parties to each other, 
<br>The recommendation of any guardian ad litem of the child




<br>


<br>Child support is determined by reference to the Ohio Child Support Guidelines and includes a chart to calculate the child's needs based upon the combined income of the parties. For example, if the combined income of you and your spouse is $96,000

<br>Recommend learn the laws around divorce and custody in the state you are located in. 




<br>


<br>Don't. (I am not unbiased) (There are training programs for this)
<br>If you decide you want to do that work, then you are not also the therapist for the parties involved. 
<br>Sometimes you may be asked to testify based on the work you have done with one of the parents, do your best not to. You can put that into your consent form, although might not be considered a legal document.


<br>


<br>Whenever there is a divorce with custody agreements about children, then you need to review those custody agreements and get the consent of parents who share custody with their children. If a parent has sole custody then their consent is enough. If there is shared custody, then both parents must provide consent to treatment, unless there is a stipulation in the custody agreement that says otherwise. 

<br>You can work with child and parent of up to 6 session without consent. 




<br>


<br>Can apply for social work and counselor jobs.

<br>


<br>As a licensed MFT in Ohio, you are mandated to report a colleague you believe to be practicing unethically. Our ethics code also suggests that we abide by our state regulation and report alleged unethical conduct. 

<br>You could be asked to leave the program if you do not keep up on your notes. 

<br>TherapyNote only takes 10-15 minutes. You have 48 hours, but the goal is 24 hours. SOAP (Subjective (what was I thinking, what was happening, process); Objective (we showed up and discussed, if assigned homework); Assessment (things of the process); Procedure (What we are doing next time or next session)). No use of jargon, think of client getting the note, concerned something may have legal ramifications, 

<br>Applying standard of care to these couples, feels straight forward but you can get hung up. MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE A THERAPY NOTE




<br>If you are dating a client, it does not always mean you lose your license. They could require you to do more practicum and classes. (Remediation procedures in place)


<br>What to do if you are accused?

<br>

<br>Makes health information portable so that individuals can maintain health insurance between jobs.


<br>Ensure that health care plans and providers are held accountable with regard to keeping health information private
<br>Provides federal privacy protections for physical and mental health information known as protected health information (PHI).


<br><a data-href="Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/health-information-technology-for-economic-and-clinical-health-act-(hitech).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)</a>:

<br>Increases patient rights over their PHI
<br>Increases restrictions over disclosure of PHI
<br>Increased fines for HIPAA violations
<br>Funding for compliance audits


<br>HIPPA/HITECH Compliance:

<br>If you furnish bills, receive payments for health care, and any transactions are sent in electronic form, you are a covered entity (CE).
<br>If an organization creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a CE, it is considered a business association of the CE.
<br>If you take self-pay only and do not bill insurance, then you might not be a CE, but HIPAA is becoming a standard of care.
<br>State Laws and our Ethics Code are actually more stringent than HIPAA around the confidentiality and privacy of therapy in terms of notes, diagnoses, etc.
<br>When working for a CE, have to provide a Notice of Privacy Practices, a disclosure about what information can be shared and what can’t be.
<br>Biggest concerns are about electronic medical records and breaches of confidentiality
<br>Use only HIPAA compliant software which encrypts and has lots of safeguards against hackers including back-ups etc.
<br>HITECH compels CE’s to notify anyone effected by a breach of confidentiality within 60 days of the discovery of the incident with a risk analysis.
<br>Follow your agencies rules and regulations and report any breach to supervisor, they should then follow what ever procedure is set up.

<br>Standards of care: (Know your state's regulation)

<br>In Ohio, relaxed the rule that you have to see the person in-person at least once. 
<br>Now you have to have a way to identify that you are treating the person they say they are (some form of picture ID).
<br>Have to have procedures for emergencies (local therapists, or other agencies that can respond if client is suicidal/homicidal).
<br>Have to have a signed consent form.
<br>Can't practice across state lines
<br>Billing? Must be HIPAA compliant.
<br>Zoom is not HIPAA compliant, have to have a platform that is.
<br>Most studies suggest that telehealth is just as effective as in-person therapy. 
<br>For CFT's, how do you pay attention to process via telehealth?
<br>Need to find creative ways to engage all members of the system on a small screen.

<br>


<br>==**Honoring Public Trust:

<br>The AAMFT strives to honor the public trust in MFTs by setting standards for ethical practice as described in this code. 


<br>==**Commitment to Service, Advocacy, and Public Participation:

<br>MFTs embody these aspirations by participating in activities that contribute to a better community and society, including devoting a portion of their professional activity to services for which there is little or no financial return. MFTs are concerned with developing laws and regulations pertaining to MFT that serve the public interest, and with altering such laws and regulations that are not in the public interest. MFTs also encourage public participation in the design and delivery of professional services and in the regulation of practitioners. 


<br>==**Seeking Consultation:

<br>The absence of an explicit reference to a specific behavior or situation in the Code does not meant that the behavior is ethical or unethical
<br>MFTs who are uncertain about the ethics should seek counsel from consultants, attorneys, supervisors, colleagues, or other appropriate authorities


<br>==**Ethical Decision-Making:

<br>If the AAMFT Code of Ethics prescribes a standard higher than that required by law, MFTs must meet the higher standard of the AAMFT Code of Ethics. MFTs comply with the mandates of law, but make known their commitment to the AAMFT Code of Ethics and take steps to resolve the conflict in a responsible manner. 
<br>MFTs remain accountable to the AAMFT Code of Ethics when acting as members or employees of organizations. MFTs make known to the organization their commitment to the AAMFT Code of Ethics and resolve any conflict in a way that allows the fullest adherence to the Code of Ethics


<br>==**Binding Expectations:

<br>The AAMFT Code of Ethics is binding on members of AAMFT in all membership categories, all AAMFT Approved Supervisors and all applicants for membership or the Approved Supervisor designation. AAMFT members have an obligation to be familiar with the AAMFT Code of Ethics and its application to their professional service.
<br>Lack of awareness or misunderstanding of an ethical standard is not a defense to a charge of unethical conduct.


<br>==**Resolving Complaints:

<br>The process for filing, investigating, and resolving complains of unethical conduct is described in the current AAMFT Procedures for Handling Ethical Matters. Persons Accused are considered innocent by the Ethics Committee until proven guilty, except as otherwise provided, and are entitled to due process. 
<br>If an AAMFT member resigns in anticipation of, or during the course of, an ethics investigation, the Ethics Committee will complete its investigation. Any publication of action taken by the Association will include the fact that the member attempted to resign during the investigation. 


<br>==**Aspirational Core Values:

<br>These values are intended to provide an aspirational framework within which MFTs may pursue the highest goals of practice. 
<br>==___The core values of AAMFT embody:

<br>Acceptance, appreciation, and inclusion of a diverse membership. 
<br>Distinctiveness and excellence in training of MFTs and those desiring to advance their skills, knowledge, and expertise in systemic and relational therapies. 
<br>Responsiveness and excellence in service to members.

<br>MFTs limit client's access to their records only in exceptional circumstances when they are concerned, based on compelling evidence, that such access could cause serious harm to the client. The client's request and the rationale for withholding some or all of the record should be documented in the client's file. 
<br>MFTs take steps to protect the confidentiality of other individuals identified in client records.


<br>***2.4 Confidentiality in Non-Clinical Activities:

<br>


<br>Responsibility to Students and Supervisees

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not exploit the trust and dependency of students and supervisees. 


<br>***4.1 Exploitation. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists who are in a supervisory role are aware of their influential positions with respect to students and supervisees, and they avoid exploiting the trust and dependency of such persons. Therapists, therefore, make every effort to avoid conditions and multiple relationships that could impair professional objectivity or increase the risk of exploitation. When the risk of impairment or exploitation exists due to conditions or multiple roles, therapists take appropriate precautions. 


<br>***4.2 Therapy with Students or Supervisees. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not provide therapy to current students or supervisees. 


<br>***4.3 Sexual Intimacy with Students or Supervisees. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not engage in sexual intimacy with students or supervisees during the evaluative or training relationship between the therapist and student or supervisee.

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not permit students or supervisees to perform or to hold themselves out as competent to perform professional services beyond their training, level of experience, and competence. 


<br>***4.5 Oversight of Supervisee Professionalism. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists take reasonable measures to ensure that services provided by supervisees are professional. 


<br>***4.6 Existing Relationship with Students or Supervisees:

<br>Marriage and family therapists are aware of their influential positions with respect to supervisees, and they avoid exploiting the trust and dependency of such persons. Supervisors, therefore, make every effort to avoid conditions and multiple relationships with supervisees that could impair professional judgment or increase the risk of exploitation. Examples of such relationships include, but are not limited to, business or close personal relationships with supervisees or the supervisee’s immediate family. When the risk of impairment or exploitation exists due to conditions or multiple roles, supervisors document the appropriate precautions taken. 


<br>***4.7 Confidentiality with Supervisees:

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not disclose supervisee confidences except by written authorization or waiver, or when mandated or permitted by law. In educational or training settings where there are multiple supervisors, disclosures are permitted only to other professional colleagues, administrators, or employers who share responsibility for training of the supervisee. Verbal authorization will not be sufficient except in emergency situations, unless prohibited by law. 


<br>***4.8 Payment for Supervision:

<br>Marriage and family therapists providing clinical supervision shall not enter into financial arrangements with supervisees through deceptive or exploitative practices, nor shall marriage and family therapists providing clinical supervision exert undue influence over supervisees when establishing supervision fees.

<br>


<br>==**Research and Publication:

<br>Marriage and family therapists respect the dignity and protect the welfare of research participants, and are aware of applicable laws, regulations, and professional standards governing the conduct of research. 


<br>***5.1 Institutional Approval: 

<br>When institutional approval is required, marriage and family therapists submit accurate information about their research proposals and obtain appropriate approval prior to conducting the research


<br>***5.2 Protection of Research Participants: 

<br>Marriage and family therapists are responsible for making careful examinations of ethical acceptability in planning research. To the extent that services to research participants may be compromised by participation in research, marriage and family therapists seek the ethical advice of qualified professionals not directly involved in the investigation and observe safeguards to protect the rights of research participants. 


<br>***5.3 Informed Consent to Research. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists inform participants about the purpose of the research, expected length, and research procedures. They also inform participants of the aspects of the research that might reasonably be expected to influence willingness to participate such as potential risks, discomforts, or adverse effects. Marriage and family therapists are especially sensitive to the possibility of diminished consent when participants are also receiving clinical services, or have impairments which limit understanding and/or communication, or when participants are children. Marriage and family therapists inform participants about any potential research benefits, the limits of confidentiality, and whom to contact concerning questions about the research and their rights as research participants.


<br>***5.4 Right to Decline or Withdraw Participation:

<br>Marriage and family therapists respect each participant’s freedom to decline participation in or to withdraw from a research study at any time. This obligation requires special thought and consideration when investigators or other members of the research team are in positions of authority or influence over participants. Marriage and family therapists, therefore, make every effort to avoid multiple relationships with research participants that could impair professional judgment or increase the risk of exploitation. When offering inducements for research participation, marriage and family therapists make reasonable efforts to avoid offering inappropriate or excessive inducements when such inducements are likely to coerce participation. 


<br>***5.5 Confidentiality of Research Data. 

<br>Information obtained about a research participant during the course of an investigation is confidential unless there is a waiver previously obtained in writing. When the possibility exists that others, including family members, may obtain access to such information, this possibility, together with the plan for protecting confidentiality, is explained as part of the procedure for obtaining informed consent. 


<br>***5.6 Publication. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not fabricate research results. Marriage and family therapists disclose potential conflicts of interest and take authorship credit only for work they have performed or to which they have contributed. Publication credits accurately reflect the relative contributions of the individual involved. 


<br>***5.7 Authorship of Student Work. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not accept or require authorship credit for a publication based from student’s research, unless the marriage and family therapist made a substantial contribution beyond being a faculty advisor or research committee member. Co-authorship on student research should be determined in accordance with principles of fairness and justice. 


<br>***5.8 Plagiarism. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists who are the authors of books or other materials that are published or distributed do not plagiarize or fail to cite persons to whom credit for original ideas or work is due. 


<br>***5.9 Accuracy in Publication. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists who are authors of books or other materials published or distributed by an organization take reasonable precautions to ensure that the published materials are accurate and factual. 




<br>


<br>Therapy, supervision, and other professional services engaged in by marriage and family therapists take place over an increasing number of technological platforms. There are great benefits and responsibilities inherent in both the traditional therapeutic and supervision contexts, as well as in the utilization of technologically-assisted professional services. This standard addresses basic ethical requirements of offering therapy, supervision, and related professional services using electronic means
<br>***6.1 Technology Assisted Services:

<br>Prior to commencing therapy or supervision services through electronic means (including but not limited to phone and Internet), marriage and family therapists ensure that they are compliant with all relevant laws for the delivery of such services. Additionally, marriage and family therapists must: (a) determine that technologically assisted services or supervision are appropriate for clients or supervisees, considering professional, intellectual, emotional, and physical needs; (b) inform clients or supervisees of the potential risks and benefits associated with technologically-assisted services; (c) ensure the security of their communication medium; and (d) only commence electronic therapy or supervision after appropriate education, training, or supervised experience using the relevant technology. 


<br>6.2 Consent to Treat or Supervise:

<br>Clients and supervisees, whether contracting for services as individuals, dyads, families, or groups, must be made aware of the risks and responsibilities associated with technology-assisted services. Therapists are to advise clients and supervisees in writing of these risks, and of both the therapist’s and clients’/supervisees’ responsibilities for minimizing such risks. 


<br>***6.3 Confidentiality and Professional Responsibilities: 

<br>It is the therapist’s or supervisor’s responsibility to choose technological platforms that adhere to standards of best practices related to confidentiality and quality of services, and that meet applicable laws. Clients and supervisees are to be made aware in writing of the limitations and protections offered by the therapist’s or supervisor’s technology. 


<br>***6.4 Technology and Documentation:

<br>Therapists and supervisors are to ensure that all documentation containing identifying or otherwise sensitive information which is electronically stored and/or transferred is done using technology that adhere to standards of best practices related to confidentiality and quality of services, and that meet applicable laws. Clients and supervisees are to be made aware in writing of the limitations and protections offered by the therapist’s or supervisor’s technology. 


<br>***6.5 Location of Services and Practice:

<br>Therapists and supervisors follow all applicable laws regarding location of practice and services, and do not use technologically-assisted means for practicing outside of their allowed jurisdictions. 


<br>***6.6 Training and Use of Current Technology:

<br>Marriage and family therapists ensure that they are well trained and competent in the use of all chosen technology-assisted professional services. Careful choices of audio, video, and other options are made in order to optimize quality and security of services, and to adhere to standards of best practices for technology-assisted services. Furthermore, such choices of technology are to be suitably advanced and current so as to best serve the professional needs of clients and supervisees.

<br>Marriage and family therapists aspire to the highest of standards in providing testimony in various contexts within the legal system. 
<br>***7.1 Performance of Forensic Services:

<br>Marriage and family therapists may perform forensic services which may include interviews, consultations, evaluations, reports, and assessments both formal and informal, in keeping with applicable laws and competencies. 


<br>***7.2 Testimony in Legal Proceedings:

<br>Marriage and family therapists who provide expert or fact witness testimony in legal proceedings avoid misleading judgments, base conclusions and opinions on appropriate data, and avoid inaccuracies insofar as possible. When offering testimony, as marriage and family therapy experts, they shall strive to be accurate, objective, fair, and independent. 


<br>***7.3 Competence:

<br>Marriage and family therapists demonstrate competence via education and experience in providing testimony in legal systems


<br>***7.4 Informed Consent:

<br>Marriage and family therapists provide written notice and make reasonable efforts to obtain written consents of persons who are the subject(s) of evaluations and inform clients about the evaluation process, use of information and recommendations, financial arrangements, and the role of the therapist within the legal system. 


<br>***7.5 Avoiding Conflicts:

<br>Clear distinctions are made between therapy and evaluations. Marriage and family therapists avoid conflict in roles in legal proceedings wherever possible and disclose potential conflicts. As therapy begins, marriage and family therapists clarify roles and the extent of confidentiality when legal systems are involved. 


<br>***7.6 Avoiding Dual Roles:

<br>Marriage and family therapists avoid providing therapy to clients for whom the therapist has provided a forensic evaluation and avoid providing evaluations for those who are clients, unless otherwise mandated by legal systems. 


<br>***7.7 Separation of Custody Evaluation from Therapy:

<br>Marriage and family therapists avoid conflicts of interest in treating minors or adults involved in custody or visitation actions by not performing evaluations for custody, residence, or visitation of the minor. Marriage and family therapists who treat minors may provide the court or mental health professional performing the evaluation with information about the minor from the marriage and family therapist’s perspective as a treating marriage and family therapist, so long as the marriage and family therapist obtains appropriate consents to release information. 


<br>***7.8 Professional Opinions:

<br>Marriage and family therapists who provide forensic evaluations avoid offering professional opinions about persons they have not directly interviewed. Marriage and family therapists declare the limits of their competencies and information. 


<br>***7.9 Changes in Service:

<br>Clients are informed if changes in the role of provision of services of marriage and family therapy occur and/or are mandated by a legal system. 


<br>***7.10 Familiarity with Rules:

<br>Marriage and family therapists who provide forensic evaluations are familiar with judicial and/ or administrative rules prescribing their roles. 




<br>


<br>==****Financial Arrangements:

<br>Marriage and family therapists make financial arrangements with clients, third-party payors, and supervisees that are reasonably understandable and conform to accepted professional practices. 


<br>***8.1 Financial Integrity:

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not offer or accept kickbacks, rebates, bonuses, or other remuneration for referrals. Fee-for-service arrangements are not prohibited. 


<br>***8.2 Disclosure of Financial Policies:

<br>Prior to entering into the therapeutic or supervisory relationship, marriage and family therapists clearly disclose and explain to clients and supervisees: (a) all financial arrangements and fees related to professional services, including charges for canceled or missed appointments; (b) the use of collection agencies or legal measures for nonpayment; and (c) the procedure for obtaining payment from the client, to the extent allowed by law, if payment is denied by the third-party payor. Once services have begun, therapists provide reasonable notice of any changes in fees or other charges. 


<br>***8.3 Notice of Payment Recovery Procedures:

<br>Marriage and family therapists give reasonable notice to clients with unpaid balances of their intent to seek collection by agency or legal recourse. When such action is taken, therapists will not disclose clinical information. 


<br>***8.4 Truthful Representation of Services:

<br>Marriage and family therapists represent facts truthfully to clients, third-party payors, and supervisees regarding services rendered


<br>***8.5 Bartering:

<br>Marriage and family therapists ordinarily refrain from accepting goods and services from clients in return for services rendered. Bartering for professional services may be conducted only if: (a) the supervisee or client requests it; (b) the relationship is not exploitative; (c) the professional relationship is not distorted; and (d) a clear written contract is established. 


<br>***8.6 Withholding Records for Non-Payment:

<br>Marriage and family therapists may not withhold records under their immediate control that are requested and needed for a client’s treatment solely because payment has not been received for past services, except as otherwise provided by law. 


<br>


<br>


<br>==***Advertising: 

<br>Marriage and family therapists engage in appropriate informational activities, including those that enable the public, referral sources, or others to choose professional services on an informed basis. 


<br>***9.1 Accurate Professional Representation

<br>Marriage and family therapists accurately represent their competencies, education, training, and experience relevant to their practice of marriage and family therapy in accordance with applicable law. 


<br>***9.2 Promotional Materials. 

<br>Marriage and family therapists ensure that advertisements and publications in any media are true, accurate, and in accordance with applicable law. 


<br>***9.3 Professional Affiliations:

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not hold themselves out as being partners or associates of a firm if they are not. 


<br>***9.4 Professional Identification:

<br>Marriage and family therapists do not use any professional identification (such as a business card, office sign, letterhead, Internet, or telephone or association directory listing) if it includes a statement or claim that is false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive. 


<br>***9.5 Educational Credentials:

<br>Marriage and family therapists claim degrees for their clinical services only if those degrees demonstrate training and education in marriage and family therapy or related fields. 


<br>***9.6 Employee or Supervisee Qualifications: 

<br>Marriage and family therapists make certain that the qualifications of their employees and supervisees are represented in a manner that is true, accurate, and in accordance with applicable law. 


<br>***9.7 Specialization:

<br>Marriage and family therapists represent themselves as providing specialized services only after taking reasonable steps to ensure the competence of their work and to protect clients, supervisees, and others from harm. 


<br>***9.8 Correction of Misinformation:

Given couple distress and volatility following disclosure, understandably some therapists judge accommodating an infidelity secret both efficient and compassionate. Employing Western ethics and an attachment ⁄ intimacy lens, we consider ethical, pragmatic, and attachment intimacy implications of accommodating infidelity secrets. Issues bearing on the decision to facilitate disclosure or accommodate nondisclosure include (a) relationship ethics and pragmatics; (b) attachment and intimacy consequences; and (c) prospects for healing. We conclude that facilitating voluntary disclosure of infidelity, although difficult and demanding, represents the most ethical action with the best prospects for renewed and vital attachment intimacy.<br><br>
<br>A critical and potentially polarizing decision in treating infidelity is whether facilitating partner disclosure or accommodating nondisclosure is most beneficial following private disclosure of infidelity to the therapist.
<br>facilitating voluntary disclosure of infidelity, although difficult and demanding, represents the most ethical action with the best prospects for renewed and vital attachment intimacy.
<br>The damaging impact of affairs on the couple relationship as well as on the individual partners is significant, is ranked by therapists as second only to couple violence in its destructive effects, and is the single most predictor of divorce." (pg. 125)

<br>The relational therapy of MFTs should be responsive to infidelity secrets in a way that is 

<br>(a) ethically defensible, both in terms of relationship ethics and therapy ethics 
<br>(b) contextualized in theoretical understanding of relationship attachment dynamics 
<br>(c) clinically sound, in terms of positive relationship outcomes that can be anticipated 
<br>(d) clearly operationalized, describing the step-by-step clinical process protocol necessary to deal with repercussions particular to the therapist’s chosen approach to infidelity secrets. (pg. 126)


<br>Individual Rights in Pair-Bond Relationships:

<br>Individuals Possess Inalienable Rights To:

<br>Relationship Choice:

<br>To choose the relationships in which they are willing to participate and to be fully informed about information that bears on that choice.


<br>Relationship Definition:

<br>To determine the ideals and goals for their relationships.


<br>Relationship Circumscription:

<br>To choose the relationship conditions that are acceptable to them, defining appropriate and inappropriate behavior within and outside the relationship, and establishing relational boundaries and stipulations for what each partner expects from the other.






<br>"Using the theoretical perspective of attachment security and intimacy, we argue that accommodating a secret has strong potential to harm the relationship and that the potential for benefits is doubtful." (pg. 127)
<br>The final approach, professional judgment, involves the therapist reserving the right to use their professional judgment about whether or not to disclose a secret on behalf of a client, and is perhaps the most commonly documented approach to navigating secrets in couple’s therapy.
<br>


<br>The therapist’s response to one partner’s confidential revelation of an infidelity secret is critically important, as the subsequent unfolding of couple therapy is unavoidably and fundamentally shaped by this early decision. Within the couple relationship, choices related to an infidelity secret include: 

<br>Full disclosure unilaterally ventured by the offending spouse
<br>Partial disclosure unilaterally determined by the offending spouse
<br>Nondisclosure unilaterally determined by the offending spouse
<br>Measured disclosure determined by the expressed desires of the non-offending spouse.


<br>The response to an infidelity secret is therefore likely to be a critical factor in therapy, determining the type of relationship outcomes that can potentially be achieved.
<br>Therapists’ preparation for and response to a confidentially disclosed infidelity secret represent a critical early turning point in the direction and course of couple treatment.<br>

<br>This paper is intended to help therapists recognize family secrets, to clarify the theoretical and relational contexts in which they are embedded, and to suggest guidelines and approaches for their therapeutic management. A related aim is to raise and address some of the ethical issues that are inseparable from a consideration of family secrets.
<br><br>
<br>Secrets involve information that is either withheld or differentially shared between or among people.
<br>Secrets tend, for the most part, not to be about feelings or thoughts, but about facts, real happenings or incidents.

<br>Importance of what Boszormenyi-Nagy and his coworkers have described as the ethical-existential dimension of human life in close relationships.

<br>This dimension concerns the facts of a person's life and their impact on him/her and those in relationship with him/her, as well as the actions of each person toward one another, especially as they affect mutual debts, entitlements, and trustworthiness.




<br>The network of persons involved in the secret as the awareness context.

<br>Refers to the network as a whole and includes those who are unaware of the secret as well as those who know it.


<br>A fairly simple typology of secrets can be drawn from the kinds of boundaries created in the relational system. From this perspective, three major types of family secrets emerge: (a) individual secrets; (b) internal family secrets; and (c) shared family secrets.

<br>Individual secrets involve those cases in which one person keeps a secret from the other person or persons in the family.

<br>In both cases, one person's secret is shared with no one else in the family. The boundary formed by the secret is located between the person holding the secret and the other(s).


<br>Internal family secrets involve those cases in which at least two people keep a secret from at least one other.

<br>Internal family secrets create sub-groupings within the family.


<br>Shared family secrets involve those cases in which all members of the family know the secret but are pledged to keep it from persons outside the family.

<br>Shared family secrets strengthen the boundaries separating the family as a whole from the outside world.




<br>The person or persons who know and keep the secret can be referred to as the secret-holder(s) and the person who does not know the secret as the unaware.
<br>The subject, meaning the person that the secret is about. Subject and secret-holder may be one and the same person, or they may be different.
<br>The confusion that surrounds secrets may make it difficult in some cases to make absolute distinctions between knowing and not knowing a secret.
<br>For some secret-holders, there may be absolute clarity about the fact that there is a secret, but others may be quite surprised to recognize the secret as such.
<br>There is a need for a way to identify secrets, even when the secret-holder is unaware of them as such.
<br>The therapist should immediately consider the possible existence of secrets any time the word "know" needs to be used more than once in a sentence either by the patient or the therapist.
<br><br>
<br>It is nearly impossible to overemphasize the significance of loyalty dynamics in the creation, maintenance, and eventual facing of secrets in families. Often, the secret-holder feels, or may actually be, "sworn to silence." S/he owes it to the other person(s) to keep the secret. Disclosing the secret would be experienced as an act of betrayal and would arouse guilt over disloyalty. These cases concern dynamics of loyalty to the secret-holder(s). But the awareness context is further complicated by the fact that a secret-holder may also feel loyalty to the unaware.
<br>Highlight<br>
<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Boszormenyi-Nagy has described as a "split-loyalty pattern"<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
loyalty dynamics can contribute to the creation and maintenance of family secrets that, in turn, are likely to generate or exacerbate split-loyalty patterns.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In some cases of secrets, there is an element of "one-upsmanship;"; the secret-holder feels "one-up" on the unaware.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The power dynamics implied here exist in more subtle and often much more destructive forms in nominally more mature relationships; the secret-holder gloats in his/her secret knowledge and the other's ignorance.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
the secret-holder has the threat of "un-used ammunition."<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
There is a dangerous and unstable tension inherent in these power dynamics of secrets because, in order to be able to savor the full effect of the secret, to squeeze every ounce of cruelty from it, the secret-holder must reveal it. Then s/he can see the reaction of the other person when s/he realizes s/he has been deceived. There is, therefore, an inherent instability in such patterns, always pressing toward destructive disclosures.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Internal family secrets create or strengthen boundaries and alliances within the family between secret-holders. Estrangements develop between secret-holders and the unaware in response to the secret-holder's inability or unwillingness to discuss the secret and to the deception or mystification that often follows in the wake of secrets.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
A curious fact about secrets is that the boundaries created by them depend not only upon who knows the secret but knowing who knows.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
the boundary created between the two sons is just as real as that created between the secret-holder and the unaware, even though both know the secret.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
When all members know the secret and, unlike the case above, know they all know, the secret serves to strengthen the boundary between the family and the outside world. In extreme cases, it may make alliances between family members and persons outside the family virtually impossible if they feel they can neither reveal the secret nor become involved emotionally without revealing the secret.<br>

In couple’s therapy, secrets between the couple often arise, and couple’s therapists must navigate a balance between their ethical and therapeutic responsibilities. This paper provides a scoping review of the literature on how couple’s therapists handle secrets in the context of couple’s therapy and discusses the ethical and clinical considerations in the context of the ethical standards of the AAMFT. Online databases were used to systematically identify peer-reviewed academic, English-language articles that focused on recommendations for therapists in handling secrets between couples in therapy. Seven articles met the search criteria. The empirical evidence supports a model of professional judgment, whereby the therapist can use their discretion about whether or not to disclose a secret on behalf of a client. To operate within the confines of ethical practice, we recommend therapists pair professional judgment with a clearly informed and signed written client policy.<br><br>

<br>Influenced by trust in the therapist and believing that self-disclosure would be beneficial.
<br>Promotes healing and attachment, but final decision about disclosure should be left to offending spouse. Voluntary consent should be obtained at the outset of therapy to avoid jeopardizing trust and to remain an equal advocate for both partners.  
<br>Possible exceptions to disclosure:

<br>Serious or terminal illness of injured spouse; imminent divorce; potential for violence; significant psychopathology in either partner; many years have passed, and issue is unrelated facilitated disclosure; it is ethical for therapists to collude in keeping secrets. Honesty is vital to recovery. 


<br>After disclosure most couples choose the challenges of healing over divorce. Disclosure of infidelity is best course of action to resolve potential conflicts and improve working alliance toward couple healing and renewal. 
<br>Through voluntary facilitated disclosure (based on the desires of aggrieved spouse) or referral, therapists should avoid double-bind of doing therapy in cases of non-disclosed secrets. 
<br>The choice to disclose is subjective - one person may readily disclose what another might choose to conceal.

<br>Though there is some literature on withholding information by the client within the context of individual therapy, the literature on the disclosure of secrets to the therapist by one member of a couple is quite sparse.

<br>Responsible handling of secrets between partners in couple's therapy is necessary to avoid ethical, legal, and therapeutic problems arising from the revelation, particularly due to the sensitive nature of secrets. 
<br>Therapeutically, a secret has the potential to undermine the development of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the secret-disclosing partner if the secret is shared with the other member of the couple. Non-disclosure may also undermine the maintenance of the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the other partner, who may perceive the therapist as triangulating with the secret holder, if the secret is not shared but arises later in the course of therapy.

<br>Additionally, there are potential ethical and legal problems that may emerge due to breaking the confidentiality of an individual through sharing a secret.

The conjoint process provides an opening for a couple to grow and learn from one another that is often lost in traditional individual approaches.

the option of keeping no information confidential could potentially limit the amount of information shared with the therapist, while the second and third options (full and partial confidentiality) risked the therapist’s collusion with the secret-holding partner (i.e., the one who knows the secret) and causing harm to the naïve partner (i.e., the one who does not know the secret). The final option – therapist’s discretion could result in feelings of betrayal by family members, even if the secret-holder were informed of the possibility of disclosure from the start<br>

approaches to handling secrets in couple’s therapy: no revelation, full revelation, partial revelation, and professional judgment<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Taking the approach of no revelation, therapists must maintain confidentiality with all clients and respect selfdetermination and autonomy of clients’ right to keep a secret from a partner<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
When therapists take the approach of full revelation, they refuse to keep a secret with one partner to avoid triangulation and maintain honesty<br>

-<br>
Highlight<br>
should be secondary to potential threats of violence or undue harm<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
partial revelation for safety reasons, holding information confidential that could increase risk of harm to a member of the couple, or others, or allowing the offending spouse to “unilaterally” determine what information to disclose<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
professional judgment, involves the therapist reserving the right to use their professional judgment about whether or not to disclose a secret on behalf of a client<br>

-<br>
Highlight<br>
the research is inconclusive regarding what type of policy or implementation practice is most effective or provides the best possible outcome for the client while respecting ethical guidelines<br>
-<br>
<br>Even we do not know how to deal with one of the common yet heartbreaking things in relational therapy. Why don’t we have something??
<br>Highlight<br>
over half of researchers use “professional judgment” as a guide; whereas roughly one in five use full revelation and one in five use no revelation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Keeping secrets in the context of therapy also depends on the nature of the secret (e.g., affairs are rarely disclosed), whether disclosure poses a danger to the partner or how impactful the consequences of disclosure would be, and the length of time which has passed since the secret event(s) occurred<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Theoretical conjecture and advice about dealing with secrets in couple’s therapy is helpful but leaves little consistency in the guidelines of handling secrets<br>

-<br>
Highlight<br>
still a proportion of clinicians who are not handling secrets within the bounds of the AAMFT ethical standard<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Not only would additional research be beneficial to further understand clinicians’ underlying motivations, it would also raise awareness of this important issue and ensure clinicians are adhering to the ethical standards.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Revealing client motivations for disclosure is important, as revealing secrets may not always have relationally sensitive intentions<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Future research should examine the ethical considerations and client impact of disclosure of a secret that is not relationally motivated<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
considerations of factors such as length of the<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
relationship, how far into the relationship the secret began, impact of the secret on progress of therapy, or seriousness of the secret<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
are all crucial considerations to the impact revelation would have on the goals of therapy<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The content of the secret may also have an impact on disclosure and requires professional judgment<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Future research would benefit from exploring content of secrets as another variable that may impact the outcomes of disclosure to provide some guidance to professional judgment.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Future research should also assess the role of sociocultural identities within the couple as it relates to secrets. The quality of the therapeutic alliance may also have an impact on the decision to reveal a secret to the therapist and/or to the partner within the context of therapy. Additionally, self of therapist issues may arise in the context of secrets in couple’s therapy<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Further research is needed to understand the role of therapeutic alliance and self of therapist issues in the context of secrets within couple’s therapy<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
future research examines the client perspective, the impact of different policies on therapeutic outcomes from the therapist and client perspective, and the ethical implications of each option<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
We recommend that therapists’ pair professional judgment with a written policy that both clients within a couple are clearly informed of and sign in order to operate within the confines of ethical practice.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
the empirical evidence to guide clinicians on their policies is scarce<br>

Maintaining confidentiality in family and couple’s therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties; there are multiple avenues for problems to arise, and it is imperative for therapists to be able to decide when they should keep secrets and when they’re justified in breaching confidentiality. To add to this dilemma, therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients. As such, the purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Upon research, it became apparent that there is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality. Furthermore, there is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists’ decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients. Thus, this literature review presents the need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones’ culture can influence their beliefs.<br>Purpose:<br>

<br>The purpose of the current paper is to determine the extent that culture influences marriage and family therapists’ understanding of their duties and responsibilities related to issues around confidentiality, as well as clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.
<br>The present study seeks to address this issue by considering the role of culture on the therapist’s decision to disclose as well as differences related to culture around clients’ feelings and expectations for privacy in therapy
<br><br>
<br>Introduction:

<br>Confidentiality in MFT can be complicated due to the various parties involved. 
<br>(AAMFT) recommend that policies concerning confidentiality be discussed at the beginning of therapy during the informed consent process.
<br>A therapist is not allowed to reveal any individual’s confidence in the system-oriented therapy setting without the prior written permission of that individual. 
<br>Gottlieb (1996) described four conceptually distinct variations of confidentiality that could be used with couples or families: 1) treat information disclosed individually as confidential; 2) inform each client that no information is confidential; 3) allow certain information to remain confidential as a matter of personal privacy; or 4) agree to allow certain information to be temporarily kept confidential, with the stipulation that it must be disclosed at a later time.
<br>May have very serious implications depending on the client (or family/couple) scenario.
<br>in cases of couple and family treatment, the therapist should outline the rules of treatment, defining who the patients are, as well as confidentiality and any limitations.
<br>There are no legal or professional ethics that directly address the issue of cultural mismatch.
<br>Maintaining confidentiality in family and couple’s therapy can prove to be complicated due to the involvement of multiple parties.
<br>Therapists must also take into account individual personalities, which includes but is not limited to cultural differences between therapists and clients.
<br>There is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality.
<br>There is a lack of research taking into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose, as well as how therapists’ decisions may differ based on their own culture, or that of their clients.
<br>Need for additional refined research in (1) decision making in confidentiality as it relates to Western and non-Western therapists, (2) how non-Western clients view the confidentiality process, and (3) how ones’ culture can influence their beliefs.
<br>One of the issues faced by therapists relates to whether or not secrets should be kept.
<br>Relational therapists’ supported facilitated disclosure of infidelity, so long as it was in an informed and voluntary manner.
<br>The therapists felt that healing and attachment security were optimally achieved through disclosure.
<br>Findings revealed that therapists spent a great deal of time deciding how to handle secrets, used a “professional judgment” approach, and informed clients verbally of their confidentiality policy. Results also revealed that 25% of the sample noted that a couple was unhappy or expressed concern over the manner in which a secret was handled and that the approach used to deal with the secret was not predictive of the number of complaints lodged.
<br>dilemma faced by marriage and family therapists when a child discloses information that a counselor is mandated to report
<br>suggest relying on sound professional judgment when deciding whether or not it is appropriate to breech confidentiality and suggest reviewing confidentiality and the limitations associated with it on an ongoing basis.
<br>Ethical issues surrounding disclosures by minor children in marriage and family therapy is grossly understudied.
<br>Marriage and family therapists be aware of their state’s laws prior to breeching confidentiality.
<br>In the event that a client is participating in illegal activity, the counselor should encourage the client to turn him or herself in to the proper authorities.
<br>Should a counselor choose to report a client’s illegal activity, the authors argue that he or she should refer the client to another therapist because the counselor has now become the accuser.
<br>Findings revealed differences in the ways of obtaining informed consent, approach to discussing confidentiality, information shared with parents or guardians, and the influence of client-specific factors on the management of confidentiality.
<br>Two factors play a large role in the therapist’s decision to breech confidentiality: 1) the negative nature of the client’s behavior, and 2) the desire to maintain the therapeutic process.
<br>A small percentage of respondents were not informing their clients about confidentiality (and its limits) until a problem arose.
<br>The author recommends review and discussion of written confidentiality policies with each client, the need for comprehensive written policies about limits to confidentiality that go beyond legally determined requirements to include collaborative relationships, third- party payers, and supervision, and training on ethical dilemmas related to confidentiality focusing on the areas identified in the study as areas of need including collaborative relationships, legal knowledge, and managed care.
<br>Grounded theory methodology revealed three main concepts: 1) defining who constitutes the therapy client, 2) maintaining privacy and confidentiality during the therapeutic process, and 3) handling private or secret disclosures made during individual breakout sessions.
<br>While some information is disclosed, other information typically considered important to the counseling relationship is not disclosed at the outset of therapy (e.g., limits of confidentiality, treatment risks).
<br>Many rehabilitation counselors do not fully inform their clients about the limits of confidentiality at the outset of counseling.
<br>Participants’ view of privacy differed greatly from Western views and that the privacy protections used in the study created discomfort among participants.
<br>Any definition of privacy must take into account the cultural variations in defining and understanding this concept.
<br>Confidentiality is not a one-size fits all approach, particularly for practitioners working with a very diverse caseload.
<br>More research is needed to directly assess cultural influences on the confidentiality.
<br>Therapists can take steps to ensure that they become more culturally competent.
<br>They note that many Native Americans consider silence to be a sign of respect, and that they value careful listening.  Some may even perceive too many questions as being rude or disrespectful, along with taking notes during an interview since it defers from vigilant listening.
<br>Asian American individuals may be less confrontational and yearn for harmonious relationships. They may also view direct eye contact as invasive, and may desire a level of formal respect.
<br>As with Hispanic/Latin American individuals, religion may take prominence over therapy; the Catholic Church is very influential within this group, and often plays a vital role in helping individuals with mental health problems.
<br>Some Hispanic/Latin American individuals may believe that their mental health is out of their control, which may create issues in situations where a therapist needs to aid the individual in establishing a locus of control.
<br>Individuals within cultures are very diverse, and it is unfair to assume that these guidelines will apply to every single person.
<br>It is still imperative for therapists to have knowledge of the possible cultural influences, as this can undeniably affect the client-therapist relationship including, but not limited to, the confidentiality process.
<br>There is a dearth of information exploring clients’ perceptions and understanding of confidentiality and even less that takes into account how cultural components may influence a client’s willingness to disclose during sessions.
<br>The majority of studies focused on these issues without directly considering cultural influences.
<br>Therapists should be weary of clients’ and their own cultural influences; careful care should be taken to ensure that the client understands the therapists’ confidentiality terms and conditions when confidentiality terms or a secret may not be maintained.
<br>It is recommended that family therapists take into account the context of culture prior therapeutic decisions.
<br>Culture plays a large role in an individual’s decision-making process in terms of when it is appropriate to breech confidentiality as well as how the breech is perceived.
<br>Values may not always be considered ethical, which may create the possibility that a clinician’s personal values do not protect the welfare of his or her clients.
<br>A lack of understanding around the limits of confidentiality would limit the amount of information disclosed in sessions.
<br>Examined psychologists knowledge of legal and ethical guidelines and found almost 75% of participants were misinformed about their state laws, despite reporting a belief they were well aware of state statutes and ethical guidelines.
<br>Therapists’ understanding of the confidentiality concept as well as the implications this may have for couples and families, has been grossly understudied.
<br>The influence of culture on the therapy process is an important area of inquiry which has implications for the therapeutic alliance, the type of information disclosed, and treatment effectiveness and outcome.
<br>

<br>Therapists from different cultures viewed confidentiality policies differently, and 2) clients from different cultural backgrounds reported significant differences in their understanding and comfort level with their rights to confidentiality and its limits.


<br>May support the notion that there is passive discrimination occurring in that individuals from non-Western cultures have different perceptions and understanding of the confidentiality process, which may influence their willingness to disclose, and thus, impact the outcome of treatment.
<br>Therapists should be more proactive in assessing clients’ understanding of the confidentiality process.
<br>This lack of clear guidance has resulted in more and more providers deciding to not consult professionals in ethics or the law to resolve their ethical dilemmas; rather they are consulting supervisors and colleague.
<br>Neither the AAMFT code of ethics or New York State Mental Hygiene Law offers guidance regarding how non-Western therapists should proceed if their cultural values or worldview is inconsistent with our Western confidentiality policy.
<br>Reluctance among non-Western clinicians to breech confidentiality under any circumstance
<br>“In practice, the decision to break confidentiality is multi-factored and complex, likely influenced by a combination of the psychologist’s own values, the items and factors discussed in the present study, and additional considerations that have yet to be discovered"
<br>Confidentiality may not be a one-size-fits-all concept. Results indicate that clients from non-Western cultures did not completely understand the concept of privileged communication or the limits to confidentiality.
<br>Confidentiality policies were limited and argued for their reexamination as they relate to therapy.
<br>For some clients, the concept of confidentiality was inconsistent with their beliefs, thus creating a disconnect between one of the benchmarks of therapy (i.e., confidentiality) and an individual or family’s culture of origin.
<br>Non-Western therapists expressed reluctance to breech confidentiality under an circumstance
<br>Confidentiality guidelines should be tailored to the particular context and individuals involved in treatment.
<br>Future research may wish to examine the decision- making process as it relates to confidentiality of non-Western therapists more closely with more diverse and larger samples.
<br>It is not the intent of clinicians to conduct ineffective treatment or behave unethically; however, there does seem to be a failure to recognize the role of personal values and culture.
<br>More specific information is needed directly from non-Western clients regarding how to modify the confidentiality process in a way that is respectful, yet still provides the safeguards intended
<br>It is imperative that clinicians find a culturally-respective way to make clients feel safe to reveal what may be embarrassing or personally sensitive information in treatment
<br>More precise comparative study is needed among cultures to better understand the influence of different beliefs.
<br>Ethical therapist behavior clearly requires more than good intentions, and the values permeating therapeutic efforts must…be more than a matter of personal bias and subjectivity
<br>Will inform a decision-making manual which can be easily disseminated to educators and treatment providers.

Publisher: Suicide Research Prevention Center<br>Abstract: The potential for a marriage and family therapist (MFT) to be confronted by a suicidal client or the potential for suicide in their caseload is significant, yet few MFTs have been adequately trained in the assessment and management of suicidal risk  For that matter, so have few psychiatrists, psychologists, or other mental health professionals.<br>
<br>All too often, it is after the fact of a suicide of a client that the MFT is confronted with recognizing this gap in their training. 
<br>Clinical Competencies:

<br>Working with Individuals At-Risk for Suicide: Attitudes and Approach:

<br>No treatment will be successful without the establishment of a good therapeutic alliance with the client. 

<br>At-risk for suicide clients are often interpersonally dysfunctional and/or have significant pathology that makes difficult creating a strong working relationship. 

<br>Patients who went on to commit suicide within two years of being hospitalized, compared to others still alive, were those most often described at their intake session as guarded, hostile, difficult to interview.




<br>Approaches and Attitudes in Creating Therapeutic Alliance:

<br>Being aware of how at-risk patients affect us, and effectively managing our reactions. 
<br>It is up to the therapist to maintain a collaborative, non-adversarial stance in creating a safe harbor for these clients to share information essential for understanding their level of risk, and to develop a treatment plan that will reduce that risk. This work requires an active role for the therapist truly invested in understanding the client. 
<br>It requires the therapist to be available, accessible, and willing to foster a dependency to strengthen the initial attachment. 

<br>To effectively move ahead, the therapist and client need to develop a shared perspective and work as a team toward decreased risk. 






<br>Understanding Suicide:

<br>The therapist needs to be able to accurately characterize suicidal and self-destructive behaviors to reasonably understand concepts of intent and lethality. 

<br>Intent refers to the aims, purposes, or goals of the behavior - death (ending all further experience of pain by never more being conscious), a wish for rebirth, or to join a loved one in heaven, are commonly expressed statements that describe suicidal intent. 


<br>Understanding the data of suicide and what characterizes chronic and acute risk

<br>In many contexts, the term 'couple' has replaced 'marriage' because of its emphasis on the bond between family members/individuals. 
<br>This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. 
<br>There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage).
<br><br>
<br>Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)
<br>With respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). 
<br>With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).
<br>While the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. 
<br>With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible).
<br><br>
<br>Psychiatrists are physicians whoo specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health and emotional problems. (M.D. needed)
<br>Psychologist study the human mind and behavior. (Masters needed)
<br>Social Workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve problems. (Bachelors degree needed, unless clinical social work which needs a masters level degree)
<br>Counselors assist people with personal, family, educational, mental health, and career decisions and problems. (Masters needed)

<br>MFTs treat a wide range of serious clinical problems including:

<br>Depression
<br>Relationship issues
<br>Anxiety
<br>Biopsychosocial-rooted problems


<br>Research has shown that CFT is as effective or more effective than standard individual treatments for many mental health problems including:

<br>Substance (Ab)use
<br>Child Conduct Disorder
<br>Anorexia

<br>Psychiatry raised concern about scope of practice

<br>Wanted to keep MFTs from diagnosis


<br>Psychology sought amendments to the scope to place restrictions on psychological testing, and some oppose licensure in general. 
<br>Social Work concerned with title restriction

<br>Wanted to call its members MFTs


<br>Counselors (ACA) historically most active opponents

<br>Opposed MFT licensure all together
<br>Labeled the discipline as a subspecialty of counseling

<br>AAMFT's response 'It's not our intent to define the standards or the scope of practice of any other discipline - social work or psychology, for example, by saying what services they can perform or what training is need to perform those series. 
<br>"We assume those professions will be diligent in ensuring that their practitioners will only deliver services for which they have had training, and are competent to perform, and that the regulatory boards for those professions will police those who go beyond their competence."

<br>No family style is inherently normal or abnormal. 
<br>Whether organizational patterns are functional or dysfunctional depends largely on their fit with the family's developmental and social demands.
<br>The strength of the system requires clear yet flexible boundaries and subsystems for the ability to shift organizational patterns to accommodate needed change.

<br>Brief therapy theories


<br><br>
<br>Therapists first encountered families as adversaries. 
<br>Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. 
<br>Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. 
<br><br>
<br>Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ 

<br>I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. 
<br>I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son.


<br><br>
<br>Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. 
<br>The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. 
<br>Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. 
<br>Family members have a long history and a future together. 
<br>Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. 
<br><br>
<br>Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. 
<br>Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).
<br>We need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems.
<br><br>
<br>Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. 
<br>Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. 
<br>However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts)
<br><br>
<br>For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. 
<br>What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. 
<br><br>
<br>Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. 
<br>The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. 
<br>Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

<br>Interpretations are shaped by our context.

<br>Redefining problems not as properties of the individuals who suffer them, but as alien oppressors. 


<br><br>
<br>The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. 

<br>This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. 
<br>Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. 


<br>Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. 

<br>Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. 
<br>Structure became the target of change. 


<br>Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems. 

<br>Then, therapists aimed their interventions at those underlying beliefs. 
<br>More recently, it dawned on therapists that those belief systems do not arise in a vacuum

<br>Take a family history. 
<br>Conduct the genogram to diagram the family network. 
<br>Listen for family life cycle transitions. 
<br>Search for strengths and resilience. 
<br>Remain curious and respectful. 
<br>Explore the process of family interaction by asking questions about how family members relate to one another and inviting them to discuss their problems with one another in session. 
<br>What is keeping the family stuck?
<br>Share recommendations for treatment. 
<br><br>
<br>What is maintaining the problem?
<br>Maintain therapeutic alliance. 
<br>Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. 
<br>Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. 
<br>When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?
<br>Challenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. 
<br>The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. 
<br>Listen to people's feelings. 

<br>Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. 


<br>Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. 
<br><br>
<br>Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. 
<br>Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. 
<br>Step back and observe. 
<br>When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. 
<br>Stay calm:

<br>You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. 
<br>Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. 
<br>Be curious. 
<br>Display empathy and respect. 


<br><br>
<br>Review the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Say goodbye. 
<br>Reinforce progress. 
<br>Review what the family has accomplished. 
<br>Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges. 

<br>How will you know when things are heading backwards? And what will you do?
<br>How will you know if it is time to come back to therapy?


<br>Check-in with the family following treatment, if possible. 
<br><br>
<br>The presenting problem
<br>Understanding the referral route
<br>Identifying the systemic context 
<br>Stage of family life cycle
<br>Family structure
<br>Communication
<br>Substance use/abuse
<br>Domestic violence and sexual abuse
<br>Affairs/infidelity
<br>Cultural context (race, ethnicity, culture, gender identity, sexual orientation, class, disability, etc.)
<br><br>
<br>Explore the presenting problem.
<br>Explore attempts to deal with the problem. 

<br>What have they tried?
<br>What has been helpful?
<br>What hasn't been helpful?
<br>Has anyone who is not present been trying to help or hinder?


<br><br>
<br>Who referred the clients and why?
<br>What are their expectations?
<br>What expectations have they communicated to the family?
<br>Is participation voluntary or mandated?
<br>Who recognized the need for treatment?
<br>What other agencies are or will be involved with the case?
<br><br>
<br>Obtain a clear understanding of the interpersonal context of the problem. 
<br>Who is in the family?
<br>Are there other important figures in the life of the problem who aren't present?
<br>Family of origin, immediate family, extended family, family of choice, etc. 
<br>Are there other agencies involved? What is their input? Does the family see them as helpful?

<br>Remember that family therapy is an approach to people in context.

<br>What is your scope of practice?


<br>Specialist

<br>Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems?


<br>Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
<br>Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. 
<br>Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. 
<br><br>
<br>All behavior makes sense in context. 
<br>No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. 
<br>Family therapists work to see the big picture. 
<br>Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. 
<br><br>
<br>Share the following assumptions:

<br>A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. 
<br>Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. 
<br>Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. 
<br>Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. 


<br><br>
<br>Systems theory

<br>Systems metaphor
<br>A family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. 


<br>Social constructionist

<br>Textual metaphor
<br>People narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. 


<br><br>
<br>Skeptical of objective reality.
<br>Reality is constructed. 
<br>Reality is constructed through language. 
<br>Reality is negotiated through relationships. 
<br>Shared meanings coordinate social action. 
<br><br>
<br>Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. 
<br>Therapist assumes expert role. 
<br>Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. 
<br>Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. 
<br>Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. 
<br><br>
<br>Humans are essentially good. 
<br>All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. 
<br>Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. 
<br>Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).
<br>A supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. 
<br>Examples such as <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a>
<br><br>
<br>One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication. 
<br>An individual's behavior and symptoms always make sense in context. 
<br>All behaviors and symptoms serve a purpose within the system, allowing the system to maintain <a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>.
<br>No one individual controls behavior in a system and therefore no one individual can be blamed for problems in the family. 
<br>Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. 
<br>Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. 
<br><br>
<br>Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. 
<br>The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. 
<br>Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. 
<br>Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. 
<br>Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. 
<br>The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. 
<br>Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. 
<br><br>
<br>As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. 
<br>However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. 
<br>Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).
<br>If the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

<br>Strategic grew out of Gregory Bateson's project on <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a> at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>. 
<br>The initial emphasis was on observation and research on families, but due to the influence of Milton Erikson's work, intervention strategies were also formulated. 
<br><br>
<br>Believed in using the resources of his clients and designing a 'strategy for each specific problem'
<br>He did not care about perspective (insight) as long as their actions produced beneficial results.

<br>In therapy:

<br>Accepted and emphasized positive
<br>Used indirect and ambiguously worded directives
<br>Directed routine behaviors so that the resistance is shown through change and not through normal continuous actions.

<br><br>
<br>Strategic Therapy is any type of therapy where the therapist initiates what happens during therapy and designs a particular approach for each problem. 
<br>Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people.
<br><br>
<br>Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. 
<br>Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. 
<br>The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. 
<br>Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. 
<br>People are always communicating. 
<br>All behavior is communicative. 
<br>One cannot not communicate. 
<br>All messages have report and command functions

<br>Report = Content = information = (What is said)
<br>Command = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said


<br>If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. 
<br>Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. 
<br>The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. 
<br><br>
<br>Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. 
<br>The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life
<br>BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. 
<br>The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.
<br>Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. 
<br>The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions

<br>Go slow
<br>Engage in behavior they want to eliminate


<br>What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. 
<br>The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. 
<br>If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. 
<br>How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. 
<br>The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. 
<br>The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. 
<br>How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. 
<br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. 
<br><br>
<br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop. 
<br>They make common-sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. 
<br>For example:

<br>When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums.

<br>Rules are changed through reframes. 






<br><br>
<br>Centerpiece of the model
<br>Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it. 
<br>Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. 
<br>What often needs to happen? Reverse the solution!

<br><br>
<br>Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. 
<br>If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. 
<br>The job is simply to get the family moving again.
<br>Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful.

<br>Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around)


<br>Milan:

<br>Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. 


<br><br>
<br>Define a resolvable complaint. 

<br>Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. 

<br>Who sees it as a problem?
<br>Why is it a problem now?


<br>"What is the problem that brings you here today?" is too vague. 
<br>Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. 


<br>Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. 

<br>Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. 
<br>The solution is part of the problem.
<br>Prescribe some alternative behavior!
<br>The key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. 
<br>MRI Approach:

<br>Introduction to the treatment setup
<br>Inquiry and definition of the problem
<br>Estimation of the behavior maintaining the problem
<br>Setting goals for treatment
<br>Selecting and making behavioral interventions
<br>Termination


<br>Attempted solutions:

<br>The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. 


<br>Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories:

<br>When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT
<br>When clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING
<br>When clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS




<br>Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. 
<br><br>
<br>To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. 
<br>Paradoxical interventions:

<br>The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s).


<br>Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. 
<br>Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. 
<br>May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. 
<br>Restraining technique:

<br>Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. 


<br><br>
<br>The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. 
<br>Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. 
<br>As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. 
<br><br>
<br>Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. 
<br>Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. 
<br>Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. 
<br>The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different.

<br>Idea that one event does not 'cause' another but that events are interconnected and there are multiple factors behind a behavior. 


<br><br>
<br>To resolve, remove, or ameliorate the problem the family agreed to work on. 
<br>Behavioral, concerned with the immediate problem, and anti-insight. 
<br>Structural re-organization of the family, like the structural therapies, but with sub-goals to deal with the presenting problem. 
<br>Process, not content-focused.
<br>Emphasize short term treatment (10 sessions)
<br><br>
<br>Define a problem clearly
<br>Investigating all solutions that have previously been tried
<br>Defining a clear and concrete change to be achieved
<br>Formulating and implementing a strategy for change
<br><br>
<br>Therapists must be innovative
<br>Therapy must be customizable to families (technique driven)
<br>If families are going to change, alterations in ways their members act must precede new perceptions or feelings
<br>Focus on interpersonal payoff of psychiatric symptoms
<br><br>
<br>Social Stage:

<br>Introduction and setup
<br>Help everyone relax, greet each family member, make sure everyone is comfortable. 


<br>Problem Stage:

<br>Definition of the problem in clear behavioral terms
<br>Ask each individual for their perspective, speak to the less involved parent/partner first to get their involvement, listen carefully to the way each family member describes the problem, make sure no one interrupts until each has a turn, make observations. 
<br>Emphasize the use of directives.
<br>If therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. 


<br>Interaction Stage:

<br>Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem
<br>Encourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another?


<br>Goal Setting Stage

<br>Providing directives
<br>Give the family a task, directives


<br><br>
<br>Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. 
<br>"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation."

<br>For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. 


<br>Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions:

<br>"Who makes you depressed?"
<br>"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?"


<br>Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. 
<br><br>
<br>Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. 

<br>Example:

<br>A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent. 




<br>Mandanes talked about how one relationship may metaphorically replicate another and power struggles in couples (money, education, control of children, etc.)

<br>Hayley believed that telling people what they're doing wrong only mobilizes resistance. 

<br>Changes in behavior alter perceptions. 


<br>Milan group was interested in getting families to see things differently through (reframe) positive connotation. 

<br>Which then gets family members to behave differently. 
<br>Shift from behavior to cognition set stage for constructivist/narrative movements. 


<br><br>
<br>Families should have clear generational boundaries. 
<br>Therapists should be 'neutral' and not have expectations for families. 
<br>Therapy helps the family by simply examining the family, asking questions to help them examine their own family structure, and exposing games after which they can redesign their family into a better structure on their own.

<br>Intervention:

<br>Engage families in a series of actions that ran counter to or exaggerated rigid family rules. 


<br><br>
<br>Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. 
<br>Set minimum goals for change. 
<br>Investigate solutions to the complaints. 
<br>Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'
<br>Understand clients' preferred views. 
<br>Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'
<br>Nurture and solidify initial change. 
<br><br>
<br>Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. 
<br>Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)
<br>Therapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)
<br>Co-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)
<br>Late in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. 
<br><br>
<br>The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. 
<br>Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. 
<br>Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. 
<br>Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. 

<br>I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?
<br>I don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. 


<br>Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. 
<br>When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. 
<br>While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. 
<br><br>
<br>Define a resolvable complaint. 
<br>Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. 
<br>Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. 
<br>
<br>The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. 
<br><br>
<br>Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint

<br>Who is doing what?
<br>If I had a video of this, what would I see?


<br>Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?
<br>Determine a minimum change goal

<br>What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. 


<br>Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem:

<br>What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?
<br>What happens after these attempted solutions?


<br>Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like:

<br>What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution?


<br><br>
<br>The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. 
<br>The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions:

<br>How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?
<br>What do they hold near and dear?
<br>When are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?
<br>What is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?
<br>Whose idea was it to come? Why now?
<br>Who is most optimistic that therapy will help?


<br><br>
<br>How will you know the situation is improving?
<br>What kinds of change will you settle for?
<br>What will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?
<br>What will each of you settle for?
<br><br>
<br>Therapeutic restraint:

<br>Telling clients to 'go slow'
<br>Cautioning them about the dangers of improvement
<br>Giving insturctions about how to make the problem worse


<br>Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. 
<br>Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. 
<br>Identify problem-solution feedback loops:

<br>Demand-Refuse
<br>Discuss-Acoid
<br>Criticize-Defend
<br>Accuse-Deny


<br>Encourage the family to do less of the same:

<br>When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. 


<br><a data-href="Reframing" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reframing</a>:

<br>For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. 


<br>Acknowledging (Reinforcing):

<br>When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. 


<br>Predicting or Prescribing:

<br>Exploring the dangers of movement. 


<br>Therapeutic restraint / going slow
<br>Prescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting
<br>Jamming / experiment
<br>Reframing
<br>Less of the same
<br>Acknowledge / reinforce
<br><br>
<br>Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. 
<br>The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. 
<br>Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. 
<br>Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. 
<br>The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. 
<br><br>
<br>The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on:

<br>Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. 
<br>Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. 
<br>Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing. 


<br><br>
<br>Applicable to any family that presents with a clear complaint. 
<br>Particularly relevant for families that seem resistance to change. 
<br>Most qualitative research (case reports) and follow-up quantitative data. 
<br><br>
<br>Historically, most of the research on the effectiveness of Strategic Therapy wasn't very rigorous. 
<br>Mostly case report format. 
<br>Anecdotal support for its efficacy, although people tend not to write about their failed cases.

<br>A family is functional to the degree that it nurtures its members to negotiate well the demands of the outside world. 
<br>Boundaries set limits distinguishing subsystems from one another in varying permeability (from diffuse to rigid). 
<br>Subsystems separated by a diffuse boundary are enmeshed, whereas subsystems separated by a rigid boundary are disengaged.

<br>The family could have developed a structure different from the dysfunctional one now being displayed. 
<br>The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. 
<br>Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. 
<br><br>
<br>Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. 
<br>The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. 
<br>The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families seek help for a specific problem. 
<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. 
<br>Exploring dynamics of interaction. 
<br>Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. 
<br>The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. 
<br>The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. 
<br>Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics.

<br><br>
<br>Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. 
<br>All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. 
<br>Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. 
<br><br>
<br>Structure is:

<br>The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. 
<br>The organized pattern in which families interact


<br>Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. 
<br>Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. 
<br>Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
<br>The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. 
<br>The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. 
<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. 
<br><br>
<br>Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. 
<br>Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. 
<br>Children are common 'symptom bearers'
<br>Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems:

<br>Marital/Couple
<br>Parental
<br>Child/Sibling


<br><br>
<br>Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. 
<br>Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. 
<br>Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. 
<br><br>
<br>Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.
<br>Disengaged systems are independent, but isolated. 
<br>On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. 
<br>But limits affection and support. 
<br><br>
<br>Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.
<br>Enmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. 
<br>Too much closeness can cripple initiative. 
<br><br>
<br>Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. 
<br>Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. 
<br>Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. 
<br>Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. 
<br><br>
<br>Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. 
<br>Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. 
<br><br>
<br>In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. 
<br>The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. 
<br>Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. 
<br>Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. 
<br>What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. 
<br><br>"The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system."<br>
<br>Disengaged or enmeshed subsystems
<br>Hierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary
<br>Conflict avoidance

<br>Detouring which results in a scapegoat
<br>Cross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted)


<br>
<br>Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). 
<br>Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).
<br>Families are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of:

<br>Normative life cycle transition

<br>The arrival of a first child
<br>An adult child leaving home


<br>An acute stressor

<br>Natural Disaster
<br>Unemployment




<br><br>
<br>Single Adult
<br>Coupling
<br>Having Children
<br>Families with Young Children
<br>Families with School-Age Children
<br>Families with Adolescents
<br>Divorce
<br>Blended Families
<br>Launching Children
<br>Later Life
<br><br>
<br>Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. 
<br>Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. 
<br>All behavior makes sense in context. 
<br>The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. 
<br>Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other.

It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session.

<br>Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. 
<br>The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.
<br>Problems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.
<br>Activate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. 
<br>Create effective hierarchy:

<br>Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. 
<br>Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. 
<br>Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. 


<br><br>
<br>The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. 
<br>Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. 
<br>Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. 
<br>Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).

<br>Take-Away:

<br>Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session.


<br><br>
<br>The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including:

<br>Who should attend
<br>How often
<br>Referrals for psychiatric evaluation


<br>Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. 
<br>Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. 
<br>Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. 
<br><br>
<br>Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)
<br>Map the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)
<br>Intervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment)
<br><br>
<br>Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. 
<br>Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. 
<br>Some problems may be treated individually. 
<br>Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. 
<br>Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. 
<br>Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. 
<br>Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals.

<br><br>
<br>Assess interactions in session.

<br>Assist dyads in finishing conversations without intrusion. 
<br>Although structural family therapy begins with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be held with individuals or subgroups to strengthen boundaries. 
<br>Asking family members to change seats. 
<br>Asking family members to move seats further apart or closer together or turn toward one another. 
<br>Having separate sessions with individuals or subsystems to strengthen boundaries. 
<br>Asking one or more members to remain silent during an interaction. 
<br>Asking questions that highlight a problem boundary area (e.g., do you always answer for your son when he is asked a question?)
<br>Blocking interruptions or encouraging pauses to enable less dominant persons to speak. 
<br><br>
<br>The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. 
<br>The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. 
<br>While taking sides seems like a violation of neutrality, this is done to unbalance and realign the system (note that fairness is achieved because the therapist sides with family members in turn).

<br>The therapist sometimes challenges the way clients see things. 
<br>Act as a teacher, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. 
<br>Stroke and a Kick:

<br>To mother, "You are very helpful." (Stroke)
<br>To daughter, "Mommy sometimes takes away your voice. Can you speak for yourself?" (Kick)


<br><br>
<br>After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. 
<br>Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)
<br>To formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. 
<br>Should take into account every member. 
<br>Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. 
<br>Should not be explained to the family. 
<br>As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. 
<br>Use family's language. 
<br>Use family's content. 
<br>Include everyone. 
<br>Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. 
<br>Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. 
<br>Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. 
<br>Realize that there is no perfect reframe. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. 
<br><br>
<br>Blocking:

<br>Stopping usual transactions. 


<br>Exaggerating:

<br>Encouraging or sustaining interactions. 


<br>Silence:

<br>When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. 


<br>All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. 
<br>Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. 
<br><br>
<br>The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. 
<br>The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action.

<br>Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. 
<br>Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. 
<br>More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD)
<br><br>
<br>Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. 
<br>Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions)
<br><br>
<br>Therapist must be more flexible than the family. 
<br>Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). 
<br>Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. 
<br><br>
<br>The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. 
<br>Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).

<br><br>
<br>Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'
<br>Effectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'
<br>Currently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches.
<br><br>
<br>Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. 
<br>The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. 
<br>This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'
<br>Insufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)
<br>Effective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. 
<br>Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models.

<br>It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works:

<br>Randomized control trials
<br>Case studies data
<br>Observations of therapists and clients

<br>Collecting qualitative or quantitative




<br>Remember:

<br>Research lags behind practice in family therapy. 
<br>Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. 


<br><br>
<br>Heteronormative
<br>Pathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)
<br>Family mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances.

<br>Thoughts and perceptions
<br>Acting or behaving
<br>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. 
<br>Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. 
<br>Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. 
<br><br>
<br>Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
<br>Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. 
<br>Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers.
<br><br>
<br>Behavior is regulated by its consequences. 
<br>Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. 
<br>Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. 
<br>CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
<br>CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. 
<br>CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. 
<br><br>
<br>Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. 
<br>Deficits in communication and problem solving. 
<br>High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. 
<br>Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. 
<br>They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. 
<br>Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members)
<br><br>
<br>Behavior is maintained by its consequences. 
<br>Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)
<br>Good relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol
<br><br>
<br>CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. 
<br><br>
<br>Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)
<br>Emotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)
<br>Understand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.
<br>Uncovering hidden/automatic assumptions that keep people stuck. 
<br><br>
<br>Overgeneralizations
<br>Magnification and minimization
<br>Personalization
<br>Dichotomous thinking
<br>Labeling and mislabeling
<br>Also called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms
<br><br>
<br>Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards.
<br><br>
<br>Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. 
<br>Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. 
<br>Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. 

<br>Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words


<br>Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. 
<br>Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of
<br>The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. 
<br>Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. 
<br>This agenda of therapy is educational:

<br>Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation


<br><br>
<br>Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. 
<br>Identify behavioral goals
<br>Learn techniques to achieve these goals
<br>Facilitate social reinforcement of change
<br><br>
<br>Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)
<br>Use of homework assignments
<br>Phase out therapy gradually. 

<br>Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. 


<br>Booster sessions
<br><br>
<br>Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. 
<br>Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.'
<br><br>
<br>CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems:
<br><br>
<br>All couples run into conflict. 
<br>Conflict resolution is a critical skill. 
<br>Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. 
<br>They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. 
<br><br>
<br>Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. 
<br>Families need problem solving skills  
<br>Therapy includes:

<br>Clinical interview
<br>Rating specific behaviors
<br>Relationship satisfaction questionnaires


<br><br>
<br>Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. 
<br>Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. 
<br>Couples are helped to improve their communication. 
<br>Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making. 
<br>Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. 

<br>Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. 


<br><br>
<br>Imagery
<br>Role-play
<br>Coaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)
<br>Communication training

<br>For example:

<br>Engaging in an argument without attacking

<br><br>
<br>Identifying Automatic Thoughts

<br>Assist family members in identifying automatic thoughts
<br>To improve the skills of identifying automatic thoughts, clients are encouraged to keep a diary to jot down situations that provoke the thoughts and the resulting emotional reactions. 


<br><br>
<br>Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. 
<br>Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. 
<br>Do not be triangulated!
<br><br>
<br>CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. 
<br>CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. 
<br>CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. 
<br>CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'
<br>Blocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary
<br><br>
<br>Inclusion of other individuals if necessary
<br>Medication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT
<br>Co-therapy model is allowed
<br>Both individual and conjoint sessions are allowed. 
<br>Clients may be more likely to divulge information about their past in private sessions. 
<br>CBFT therapists tell clients they will keep this information confidential, but if it might be influencing the family's current interactions, they encourage the person to share it in a joint session
<br>Secrets
<br>Be up front with clients about the limits of confidentiality

<br>Assist them with sharing in a joint session (rather than outing them)


<br><br>
<br>Didactic role early on to strike a balance between directiveness and collaborationl 
<br>Reviews homework assignments, model skills, coaches family members in practicing them, and fosters motivation. 
<br>Balances alliances and interventions with all the family members or subsystems so that they feel supported. 
<br><br>

<br>Maintains control of the session with confidence and credibility
<br>Assumes multiple roles:

<br>Director

<br><br>
<br>Miracle question
<br>Rating/Scaling (1 to 10)
<br>Break
<br>After intermission, the therapist will give the client/family compliments, sometimes followed by a suggestion or homework. 
<br><br>
<br>If it ain't broken, don't fix it. 
<br>Once you know what works, do more of it. 
<br>If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. 
<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. 
<br>It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. 
<br>The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).
<br>Focus is on solutions, on what works for clients. 
<br>Respect clients own resources. 
<br>Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. 
<br>Future-oriented
<br>Focusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).
<br>The task of therapy is to do something different. 
<br>What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?
<br><br>
<br>The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'
<br>Solution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. 

<br>What brings you in?
<br>What are your best hopes for this meeting?


<br>Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. 
<br>Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. 
<br>It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. 
<br>Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. 
<br>The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. 
<br>Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. 
<br><br>
<br>People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. 
<br>The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. 
<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems. 
<br>The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. 

<br>Problem talk:

<br>Negative
<br>Focuses on the past
<br>Implies permanence of problems. 




<br><br>
<br>Clients are experts in their own lives. 

<br>Clients know what they need 
<br>Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?
<br>The therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. 


<br>People are resourceful. 
<br>Problems are normal life-cycle complications. 
<br>Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. 
<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. 
<br>Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. 
<br><br>
<br>Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. 
<br>Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. 
<br>The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. 
<br>The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. 
<br>The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable.

<br>What will you be doing instead?


<br>The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems – effective solutions already in their repertoire.
<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.
<br>As the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.
<br>It is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.
<br>Getting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.
<br>Change perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. 
<br>They begin living in the solution, not the problem. 
<br>The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. 
<br><br>
<br>Time limited
<br>Sessions are made one at a time
<br>One may be enough
<br>Typical course includes 3-5 sessions
<br>Clients can return as-needed
<br>Often a week to a few weeks apart
<br>Once you know more of what works, do more of it
<br><br>
<br>Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. 
<br>Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. 
<br>Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. 
<br><br>
<br>What do you think the problem is now?
<br>How will you know when the problem is solved?
<br>How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
<br>What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
<br>What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?
<br><br>
<br>What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back?
<br><br>
<br>Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). 
<br>Asks more about perceptions than feelings. 
<br>Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. 
<br>Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. 
<br>Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. 
<br>Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.
<br>Consultant
<br>Guardian of the conversation
<br>Don't get bogged down in 'problem talk'
<br>Focus on what is right
<br>Direct clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. 
<br>Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. 
<br>Focus on the 'here and now'
<br>The future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. 
<br>Assumes a position of 'not knowing.'
<br><br>
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
<br>Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
<br>Constructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. 
<br><br>
<br>Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the client to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10, where 1 represented the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone. 
<br><br>
<br>So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
<br>What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
<br>What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back?
<br><br>
<br>Developing well-focused goals within the clients' frame of reference
<br>Generating solutions based on exceptions

<br><br>
<br>Before Session

<br>Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen?


<br>In-Session

<br>What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?
<br>What changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment?


<br>Exceptions

<br>When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't?


<br>Solution-focused therapists intervene and interrupt 'problem talk' before it escalates into demoralizing bickering, blaming and defending, accusations, etc. 
<br>Agency

<br>How did you do that? How did you get that to happen?


<br>Coping

<br>How have you managed to cope, endure, keep going?


<br>Scaling (i.e., making numbers talk)

<br>What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?
<br>On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope?


<br><br>
<br>Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. 
<br>How were you hoping I could help you?
<br>Asking for clients' perceptions
<br>Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. 
<br>As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. 
<br><br>
<br>How do we know when to stop meeting like this?
<br>Goals should be:

<br>Small
<br>Salient to clients
<br>Concrete, behavioral, measurable
<br>Achieveable
<br>Involve hard work
<br>Start of something
<br>Involving new behaviors


<br>What will be present? What will be happening?
<br>After hearing and acknowledging the clients' description of the problem and what they've tried to do about them, next step is to establish clear and concrete goals. 

<br>Specifically, how will you be doing this?
<br>How will the two of you know when you solved your problems? How will things be different?
<br>What will be the first sign (or smallest step) that will tell you that you're moving in the right direction? What else?


<br>The clearer the goal, the easier to measure progress. 

<br>Can you tell me more specifically what will be happening when you two are getting along better?
<br>What will you be doing differently?


<br>Modest enough to be achievable. 
<br><br>
<br>Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don't know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened?
<br>Invite clients to envision positive outcomes and to activate problem-solving by giving them a mental picture of their goals. 
<br>Helps clients to look beyond the problem to see that what they really want might not be the elimination of the problem per se but to be able to do things that the problem has been obstructing. 
<br>Suppose one night there is a miracle and while you are sleeping the problem that brought you into therapy is solved. 

<br>How would you know?
<br>What would be different?
<br>What will you notice the next morning that will tell you there has been a miracle?
<br>What will your [family member] notice?


<br><br>
<br>Helping families see that their problems have exceptions - times when they don't occur. 
<br>Exceptions are solutions that families already have in their repertoire. 
<br>Probing for exceptions (e.g., times when the family didn't have the problem) invites them to recognize that some potential solutions may already be in their grasp. 
<br>Finding exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail; also since these exceptions just happened, it is more plausible they could happen again. 
<br>When in the recent past might the problem have happened but didn't (or was less intense or more manageable)?
<br>What's different about those times when the problem doesn't happen?
<br>How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you?
<br><br>
<br>How did you manage that?
<br>What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?
<br>How come things aren't worse?
<br>Punctuate with enthusiasm and support
<br>Work to keep solution talk in the forefront. 
<br>Listen carefully for an exception to the problem, then punctuate that exception by getting more details about it and congratualating the family on it. 
<br>Connect the exception to the family's goals by asking how the goal would be reached if this exception were to occur more often. 
<br><br>
<br>The therapist asks:

<br>On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being how depressed you felt when you called me and 10 being how you feel the day after the miracle, how do you feel right now?

<br>"It is a 2."
<br>"So, you feel a little better than when you called. How did you achieve this improvement?"
<br>"What do you think you need to do to achieve a 3?"




<br>Used to get clients to quantify their confidence that they can maintain their resolve. 

<br>On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you will be able to avoid losing your temper this week?
<br>What do you have to do to stick to your guns this time?


<br><br>
<br>Wow! How did you do that?
<br>To be effective, compliments should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. 
<br>Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work
<br><br>
<br>Team approach with therapist in session and colleagues behind the mirror. 
<br>Therapist usually takes a 10 minute break near the end of the session to compose a summary message to the clients. 
<br>The summary messages begins with a recap of what the therapist heard the clients say during the interview, including the problem, its background, the client's goals, and presession progress and strengths. 

<br>What I heard you tell me today is that... Did I hear all of you correctly? 


<br><br>
<br>A statement reflecting the therapist's reaction, including an expression of empathy. 

<br>"I'm not surprised you are so depressed."


<br>A reflection of the emotional impact on the client. 

<br>"My sense is that you must really be hurting."


<br>Compliments on pre-session changes or strengths

<br>"I was impressed by how many things you've tried to make things better."


<br>Some content on the client's goals
<br>Suggestions for building on positives
<br><br>
<br>Formula first-session task
<br>Do more of what works
<br>Do something different
<br>Go slow
<br>Do the opposite
<br>The prediction task
<br><br>
<br>Devoted to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress
<br>Inquire about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the clients' role in attaining it. 

<br>What's better?
<br>What happened that you liked?
<br>Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that. 
<br>Wow. That sounds great. What part did you especially enjoy?
<br>And what else is better? What do you think the next step might be?
<br>How did you keep things from getting worse?
<br>What's your idea about what might be helpful?


<br><br>
<br>Sometimes the model is portrayed as an approach that does not permit discussion of the problem, but this is not accurate. When done skillfully, families do not feel rushed. Emotion is not avoided, but it is also not sought or elicited. 
<br>Therapist is present as a real, genuinely concerned person, but does not engage in unneeded personal self-disclosure. 
<br><br>
<br>How can we know when to stop meeting like this?
<br>What needs to be different in your life as a result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?
<br>If you wait till all of the family's problems are solved, you will never stop seeing them.

<br><br>
<br>Knowledge is constructed. 
<br>Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave. 
<br>Experience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. 
<br>Problems affect people
<br>Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. 
<br>For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. 

<br>Hence, letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams


<br>The truth of experience is not discovered, it is created!
<br>Narrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. 
<br>Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narrative of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. 
<br>Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new futures. 
<br>People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-storied aspects of their lives and relationships. 
<br>Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. 
<br><br>
<br>Holds a position of curiosity
<br>Cherishes each person/family's unique stories. 
<br>Invites clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives. 
<br>Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. 
<br>They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapist influential, but decentered
<br>Person separate from problem
<br>All problems have exceptions
<br>Opposite of problem is preferred
<br>Preferred story woven into identity
<br>Impact of relationships explored
<br>Deconstruct societal norms
<br>Personal decision-making supported
<br><br>
<br>Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. 
<br>The problem is the problem.
<br>Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family.
<br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>

<br>There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (re-examining) established truths that oppress people's lives. 


<br><br>
<br>People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems)
<br>People are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. 
<br>People are not their problems. 
<br>People can develop alternative, empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. 
<br>Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. 
<br>Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. 
<br><br>
<br>Reject categorizing people
<br>In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves with clients. 
<br>They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. 
<br>Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. 
<br>Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. 
<br><br>
<br>Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis)
<br>Want to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relations. 
<br>When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relationship to it. 
<br>Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict.
<br>Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. 
<br><br>
<br>Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. 
<br>Problems may be regarded as alien invaders. 
<br><br>
<br>Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)
<br>Open space for new and more constructive views of themselves.
<br>Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy. 
<br>Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. 
<br><br>
<br>Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones. 
<br><a data-href="Deconstruction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/deconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deconstruction</a> involves questioning assumptions. 
<br><a data-href="Reconstruction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reconstruction</a> involves creating new and more optimistic accounts of experience. 
<br>Effects Questions (elicit effects of the problem)

<br>How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationships?
<br>Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful. 


<br>Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots. 
<br><br>
<br>Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multi-stories lives. 
<br>Once people notice how their stories are problem-saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. 
<br>Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. 
<br>At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
<br>Then, the therapists asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
<br>Meetings are typically 60 minutes.
<br>Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between).
<br><br>
<br>CAUTION:

<br>Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories. 


<br>Instead:

<br>Narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories. 

<br>Counterstory




<br>Asking Permission is central to the model. 
<br>At the start of 1 st meeting, the therapist asks if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy. 
<br>Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from previous session aloud and asking a question, such as:

<br>"Can you tell me about any new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time?"


<br>Other times the therapist begins wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations. 
<br>Therapist use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories. 

<br>For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session. 
<br>Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem. 
<br>Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keep a story alive and growing. 


<br><br>
<br>Collaborative
<br>Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. 
<br>With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem. 
<br>Takes notes of what works and what doesn't. 
<br>Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation.
<br>Therapy is a relationship - a conversation!
<br>Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories. 
<br>Open space for describing alternatives. 
<br>Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently. 
<br>Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments. 
<br>The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. 
<br>Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders. 
<br>Therapists have more questions than answers!
<br><br>
<br>It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. 
<br>How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
<br>What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
<br>How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
<br>Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
<br>What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
<br>Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
<br>Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
<br>Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
<br>How would you prefer things to be?
<br><br>
<br>People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.
<br>The therapist invites family members to:

<br>Evaluate their current situation
<br>Name the problems involved
<br>Evaluate their relationship to those problems
<br>Take a stand in regard to them
<br>Tell more satisfying stories of their lives
<br>Evaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories


<br>In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. 

<br>Private hopes and fears
<br>Family interactions
<br>Contributions of culture of origin
<br>Traditions, legacies


<br>Questioning

<br>Is that the problem speaking?
<br>Whose values are guiding you in saying that?


<br>By exposing discourses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. 
<br><br>
<br>What name would you give the problem?
<br>What is it like to experience the problem?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your life?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
<br>What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
<br>What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
<br>How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
<br>Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
<br>Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
<br>Is this conversation useful? How is it useful?

<br><br>
<br>Some families prefer a different kind of therapy than narrative, some are seeking instruction and expert advice. 
<br>Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. 
<br>Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve. 
<br>Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice
<br>More qualitative research rather than quantitative studies
<br>Little empirical support currently exists
<br>Randomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Listen to stories as stories
<br>Be attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story
<br>Ask about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationships
<br>Make sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking  'them' for 'the problem'
<br>Unless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences
<br>At some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories
<br>Try to put yourself in their shoes
<br>Do not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them
<br>Listen and ask
<br>Listen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust
<br><br>
<br>Listen 'deconstructively' to family's stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings
<br>As families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning
<br>We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
<br>And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'?
<br><br>
<br>Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society
<br>Develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work in the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult
<br>There are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play
<br>Deconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that support them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses
<br><br>
<br>The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem
<br>Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people
<br>As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families
<br>If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them

<br>What would you call that something?


<br>What 'feeds' the problem?
<br>What 'starves' the problem?
<br>Who benefits from the problem?
<br>In what settings might the problem be useful?
<br>Who advocates for the problem?
<br>What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
<br>What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships?
<br><br>
<br>Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it
<br>As we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem
<br>What are the family's preferred directions?
<br>Counterplot / counter-story
<br>'Standing against' the problem
<br><br>
<br>Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
<br>Is the problem always with you?
<br><br>
<br>Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives
<br>Double listening
<br>If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled
<br>If a person experiences injustice, they must have a conception of a just world
<br>When we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications
<br><br>
<br>Stories need listeners as well as tellers
<br>Attentive witnesses
<br>The therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful
<br>What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
<br>What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
<br>It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions

<br>Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
<br>What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them?


<br><br>
<br>Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
<br>What stood out for them?
<br>What images it brought forward?
<br>How it resonated with their own experiences?
<br>Where they were transported by the interview?
<br>Situate their reflections in their own experience
<br>Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives
<br><br>
<br>We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive
<br>We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop
<br>We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud
<br>We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems
<br>We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions
<br>In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session
<br>Out intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session
<br>We may invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives
<br><br>
<br>Opening space questions (unique outcomes)

<br>Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not?


<br>Preference questions (preferred experiences)

<br>Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how?


<br>Story development questions

<br>How is this different from when arguing is in control?


<br>Meaning questions

<br>What does it say about you that you were able to...?


<br>Questions that extend the story into the future

<br>What do you predict...


<br><br>
<br>Narrative therapy aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. 
<br><br>
<br>Reality is socially constructed. (<a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>)
<br>Reality is influenced by and communicated through language. 
<br>Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality. 
<br>There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth. 
<br><br>
<br>Telling One's Story

<br>A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. 


<br>Externalization Technique

<br>Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. 


<br>Deconstruction Technique

<br>This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. 


<br>Unique Outcomes Technique

<br>To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that does not include your most pervasive problems.


<br>Existentialism

<br>The belief that the world holds no inherent meaning, and that we all must make our own meaning in life.

<br><br>Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) is based in part on traditional behavioral couple therapy but expands both the conceptualization of couple distress and of intervention. The efficacy of IBCT has been supported in three clinical trials, including one with five year follow-up. Additionally, the effectiveness of IBCT in the real world has been supported through a system-wide dissemination effort in the United States Department of Veteran’s Affairs. The reach of IBCT has also been extended through an online program, www. OurRelationship.com, based on IBCT. A nationwide clinical trial with a representative sample of the US population demonstrated the effectiveness of this program on both relationship and individual variables.<br><br>
<br>Purpose: 

<br>Describe the IBCT conceptualization of couple distress and of couple intervention 
<br>Review the empirical evidence in support of IBCT
<br>Discuss recent innovations in treatment delivery. (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)


<br><br>“Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) is based in part on traditional behavioral couple therapy but expands both the conceptualization of couple distress and of intervention.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)<br>“Developed in the 1990s, Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) was based in part on Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT).” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)<br>“IBCT extended the conceptualization of couple distress beyond TBCT’s notions of positive to negative exchange ratios and extended the conceptualization of intervention beyond TBCT’s focus on positive behavior change through communication and problem-solving skills.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)<br><br>
<br>(a) the stuff of relationships is the interaction between partners 
<br>(b) there are three broad factors that influence that interaction: the characteristics each partner brings to the interaction and the context in which that interaction occurs.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)
<br>“IBCT conceptualizes these ideas through a simple mnemonic: the DEEP analysis or DEEP understanding of relationship problems. 

<br>DEEP:

<br>D: 

<br>Differences between partners in personality, interests, goals, among others. 


<br>E: 

<br>Emotional sensitivities or vulnerabilities that each partner brings to the relationship that may make the differences particularly problematic. 


<br>E:

<br>External circumstances, particularly stressful circumstances, which may exacerbate the problems created by differences and emotional sensitivities.


<br>P:

<br>Pattern of Interaction that couples get into as they try to navigate the problem created by the DEE.






<br>“The IBCT theory of intervention is based on the fundamental notion that all relationship problems result from the combination of a triggering action or inaction and a sensitive reaction.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111)
<br>“Relationship problems can be resolved by altering the triggering action and/or by altering the vulnerable response. In contrast to TBCT, which focuses on making change in the triggering action or inaction, IBCT provides equal or greater emphasis on changing the vulnerable response (i.e., emotional acceptance), given that most troublesome actions or inactions in relationships are not egregious acts such as violence or verbal abuse. A second key part of the IBCT theory on intervention is that altering both the triggering events and altering the emotional reactions are best achieved through ‘contingency shaped processes’ rather than ‘rule governed’ processes” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 111-112)
<br>“rule governed change is deliberate change as a result of specific instruction or training by the therapist.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“TBCT encourages couples to engage in more positive behavior with each other and teaches them communication and problem solving strategies. In contrast, contingency shaped change comes about spontaneously as a result of a change in the context and the resultant emotional and cognitive reactions.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)

<br>“Although IBCT employs both strategies, it relies more heavily on the later and assumes it will lead to more lasting change.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)


<br><br>
<br>“IBCT produced comparable or superior outcomes to TBCT in a study of 21 couples.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)

<br>“This clinical trial showed that IBCT and TBCT produced similar gains in relationship satisfaction by the end of treatment, but couples in IBCT evidenced significantly greater maintenance of gains than their TBCT counterparts during the first two years of follow-up.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“These differences between the conditions disappeared over the last three years of follow-up.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“TBCT couples made greater gains by treatment termination but IBCT couples showed greater maintenance of their gains at the two year follow-up assessment” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“The efficacy research demonstrated that IBCT is comparable or superior to TBCT, particularly in the maintenance of treatment gains.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)


<br>“couples with low-level violence could benefit from treatment without a danger for violence escalating” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“couples experiencing infidelity could benefit from treatment in the short term and, although these couples are at greater risk for separation over the long-term, those who stay together benefit as much as non-infidelity couples” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“for couples with children, treatment showed benefits for parenting” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“Higher relationship commitment and longer length of marriage were independently predictive of long-term positive outcome” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“Examination of mediators of change indicated that changes in frequency of targeted behavior, as well as acceptance of target behavior, were linked with positive outcome, with frequency more strongly linked early in therapy but acceptance more strongly linked later in therapy with outcome. As expected, TBCT generated greater changes in frequency of behavior while IBCT generated greater changes in acceptance of behavior” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“Social workers and psychologists, are trained in IBCT through an intensive 6-month training program that includes: 

<br>(a) a several day workshop
<br>(b) weekly phone supervision while trainees are seeing couples
<br>(c) observation of at least 20 audio-recorded sessions of these trainees by IBCT consultants
<br>(d) competence criteria based on ratings of these recorded sessions by IBCT consultants. 
<br>Approximately 80% of trainees complete the training successfully” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)
<br>“Preliminary evaluation of the outcome of couples treated during this training reveals that: 

<br>(a) partners in these couples have far more diagnosed psychopathology than partners in the efficacy trials
<br>(b) couples complete an average of about 10 sessions, which is fewer than the average completed in the efficacy trials
<br>(c) couples evidence significant improvement even when they have as few as 4 sessions
<br>(d) the more sessions couples have, the greater the improvement
<br>(e) effect sizes are in the low to moderate range and less than those found in the efficacy trial” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)




<br>“OurRelationship program an eight hour self-help program in which couples complete online activities consisting of text, audio, still graphics, animations, and videos.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 112)

<br>Observe Phase: 

<br>Partners complete assessments of their relationship and jointly decide on one or two core issues/problems to focus on during the program. 


<br>Understand Phase:

<br>Leads each partner through a DEEP analysis of the problem, including how differences between partners, hidden emotions, external stressors, and patterns of communication might affect their core issue(s). These separate analyses are shared during the subsequent ‘Understand’ conversation.


<br>Respond Phase:

<br>During the ‘Respond’ phase, partners develop a plan for ameliorating the problem by viewing information about acceptance and self-change, communication tips, and suggestions tailored to their presenting problem. During the ‘Respond’ conversation, couples share their strategies to improve their patterns of communication and engage in problem-solving exercises specific to their core issue(s). (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113)


<br>“the OurRelationship program was well-received, with 86% of couples completing the program and 97% of participants indicating they would recommend it to a friend.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113)
<br>“OurRelationship program created significant improvements in relationship satisfaction, as well as significant effects on depressive, and anxiety symptoms.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113)


<br>“Web-based resources — with their greater flexibility, reduced stigma, and lower costs — can reach many couples who would otherwise be unable or unwilling to seek in-person couple therapy.” (Christensen and Doss, 2017, p. 113)

<br><br>Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) attempts to improve Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT) by incorporating an emphasis on promoting acceptance into TBCTs emphasis on behavioral change. This study examined changes in couples' communication over the course of IBCT and TBCT. Early, middle, and late sessions were coded to measure couples' communication of acceptance. Results showed that IBCT couples expressed more nonblaming descriptions of problems and more soft emotions than TBCT couples during late stages of therapy. IBCT couples significantly increased their nonblaming description of problems and significantly decreased their expressions of hard emotions and their problematic communication over time. Results support the hypothesis that structural differences between the therapies affect initial levels of emotional expression in session. Increases in nonblaming descriptions of problems were significantly correlated with increases in marital satisfaction.<br><br>

Communication training teaches partners the effective use of I messages and active listening as well as the clear distinction between the speaker’s role and the listener’s role.

<br><br>This paper presents some suggestions for the implementation of Behavioural Family Therapy for families with young children. It attempts to bridge the gap between clinical research and practice by emphasizing the process of therapy delivery rather than the specific content of the behavioural approach. Suggestions for teaching behaviour management skills, contracting and the effective use of rewards and punishments are given. The common mistakes made by those working with Behavioural Family Therapy are addressed, and suggestions for working with single‐parent families are given.<br><br>

<br><br>This paper discusses the politics of marital therapy, using behavioral marital therapy (BMT)as an illustrative model. Marital therapy is viewed as inherently political. Marital therapists continuously adopt political postures without knowing it; the inadvertent consequences of this insensitivity to the political context of their work are to reinforce traditional values, many of which are oppressive to women. These political postures include an emphasis on treating dyads rather than individuals, an emphasis on behavior change, and a neglect of sex role issues. Clinical innovations are suggested: paying greater attention to whether individual well-being is promoted during the course of marital therapy; shifting toward the exploration of cognitive and perceptual processes; and expanding the emphasis of BMT on process and function to include content.<br><br>

<br>Linear thinking:

<br>Behavior is based on previous consequences. 


<br>Major Tenet:

<br>Behavior is determined by its consequences more than its antecedents. 


<br>Types of conditioning:

<br><a data-href="Classical Conditioning" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/classical-conditioning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Classical Conditioning</a>

<br><br>
<br>Big Picture:

<br>Behavioral Family Therapists are less likely to talk about how families develop and/or operate. They are concerned about the present, and how the problem is being reinforced. 


<br>Symptoms:

<br>Although they are reluctant to do so, Behavioral Therapists have delineated what distinguishes a 'healthy family' and a 'dysfunctional family' (pg. 69-74 and 97-104 in FT Handbook chapters)

<br>Mutually shared goals and expectations. 
<br>Support for the stresses associated with the expected transitional life stages, and other stressful life events. 
<br>Mutual influence, that is positive more than negative.

<br>Intervention begins with an assessment of the target child's behavior. The goal of the assessment is to get a baseline of the behavior so that you can quantify change. 
<br>Functional Analysis of Behavior:

<br>Once the problem behavior is identified, then the antecedents and consequences surrounding the behavior are explored. (stimuli, organismic variables, target behavior/response, consequences, contingencies).
<br>Report the assessment to the family. 


<br>Intervene in the pattern.

<br>Step 1: Induction (teach the lingo)
<br>Step 2: Demonstration (show them how it works)
<br>Step 3: Implementation (contingency contracts, time-out, star charts, marble game, etc.)


<br>Generalization: 

<br>The goal is that this training will be generalized to other behaviors, but booster sessions are also helpful. 




<br><br>
<br>Alexander and Parsons (1982) created for troubled adolescents and their families. Incorporates cognitive aspects and takes a more systemic approach, while the goal is behavioral change. 
<br>Integrates three perspectives:

<br>Ecological
<br>Learning Theory
<br>Cognitive
<br>Two Phases of Treatment


<br><br>
<br>Therapy:

<br>Designed to modify attitudes, assumptions, expectations, labels and emotions of the family. The major focus is to relabel (reframe) the problem behavior into something positive. 


<br>Education:

<br>Help family behave differently in conjunction with reattributions. 


<br><br>
<br>Resistance to treatment is considered an impediment to change. It is a natural consequence of the inappropriate application of technology and failure of the clinician to understand the meaning of the behavior. 
<br><br>
<br>Functional Family Therapy relabels behaviors to reduce resistance and to motivate change by providing reattributions for the causes of family members' behaviors. 

<br>Change in meaning is a necessary precursor to behavior change. 
<br>The relabeling (reframe, positive connotation, etc.) operates at three levels:


<br><br>
<br>Interactional Level:

<br>Benign description of the interpersonal impact of the behavior (distance regulation)


<br>Motivational Level:

<br>Recasts the motive for the behavior in a benign light. 


<br>Systemic Level:

<br>Emphasizes the similarities between people, a family theme. 


<br>If the reframe works it interrupts automatic processing, interrupts the behaviors that follow from this processing, and thus, changes the contingencies around the problem behavior. 
<br><br>
<br>Functional Family Therapy emphasizes paying attention to the interpersonal functions of behaviors:

<br>Functions:

<br>A person's pattern of behaviors, feelings, and thoughts mediate amounts of psychological relatedness in a relationship with another person (distance regulation)
<br>The expression of the function can be labeled good, bad, or neutral, the function itself is not judged. 
<br>These functions are properties of relationships not traits.




<br><br>
<br>Linear Thinking:

<br>Cognitive processes need to be incorporated, although some would argue that they were never eliminated in the first place (i.e. cognition is a behavior). Meanings of behaviors, attribution processes, belief sets, automatic thinking can get in the way of contingency change. 


<br>Unit of analysis tends to be the dyad:

<br>Behavior therapists have moved toward more contextual assessments, but each move out focuses on the one to one relationship rather than the system as a whole. 


<br>Dependency on the therapist?

<br>Therapist teaches the model. 


<br>Based on postivism

<br>Not postmodern, it is modern. 


<br>Politics of behavioral couple therapy, acceptance. 
<br><br>
<br>Same process as parent training. Assessment is always first. <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a> viewpoint. 
<br>Could include couple discussing an issue in the room, with therapist observing communication patterns. Also includes evaluating the relationship itself (pg. 106-107).

<br>Strengths
<br>Major complaints
<br>Sex life (affection)
<br>Future goals
<br>Alternatives to the relationship
<br>Individual functioning of each spouse


<br>Intervention:

<br>Once assessment is complete you set goals with the clients, focusing on one problem (well defined) at a time, this comes in the form of a contract. 

<br>Major Goals:

<br>Increase positive control while decreasing aversive control. 
<br>Improve communication, which should facilitate future problem solving. 


<br>Interventions:

<br>Active listening with behavioral descriptions of the problem
<br>Teach new behavior exchanges
<br>Encourage couple to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and decision making. 
<br>Teach strategies for future problem solving






<br>Techniques:

<br>Caring Days

<br>Make a list of what your partner could do to make you feel cared for. The partner does not need to do anything in return. Do not include sex as it can be seen as coercion. 


<br>Quid Pro Quo Contracts

<br>Not very common because we get into the standstill of 'they have to do it first'


<br>Good Faith Contracts

<br>Both partners engage in those behaviors whether their partner does or does not. 




<br>Politics and Power
<br><br>
<br>Politics of Behavioral Couple Therapy (i.e. Jacobson)

<br>Jacobson saw the issue with classic BMT as a problem with power, who gets to say what needs to change?
<br>IBCT was developed from these concerns, the focus shifted to acceptance and forgiveness.


<br>IBCT Deep Analysis:

<br>D

<br>Key differences between partners in personality, interests, goals, etc. 


<br>E

<br>Emotional sensitivities or vulnerabilities that each partner brings to the relationship (create a vicious cycle)


<br>E

<br>External circumstances (i.e., stressful circumstances which could exacerbate the problems created by differences and vulnerabilities)


<br>P

<br>Patterns of interaction that couples get into as they try to navigate what comes from DEE above. 




<br>Intervention based on the idea that all relationship problems result from the combination of a triggering action or inaction and a sensitive reaction. 
<br>They suggest that relationship problems can be resolved by altering the triggering action and the vulnerable response (emotional acceptance).
<br>Empirical support for the model in both clinical trials and efficacy research.

<br><br>Following recent interest in this journal in building bridges between a psychoanalytic and systemic approach to family therapy (Vol. 19, 1997), the authors take up the debate. A clinical vignette from a recent article is used for discussion and, in order to describe further work from a psychoanalytic perspective, two case vignettes are presented. The comparisons are discussed with particular reference to the concepts of projective identification, transference/countertransference and internal object relations.<br><br>

Consequently, the understanding of family life and emotional nurturance may be seen as broadly organized under three general learning types: (1) those which learn from experience, (2) those relying on more narcissistic mechanisms, and (3) those functioning at a parasitic level.

<br>"We may feel secure enough to explore if we can predict that support will be readily available if and when it is needed, especially if new ventures run into trouble or if potentially dangerous situations arise. Difficulties that lead to consultations with a family therapist often arise out of conflict within the family's own relationships."
<br>"The family script can provide routines for family life which can be followed almost automatically."
<br>"Repetition becomes the background against which change is the foreground, that which is new becomes the focus of attention. In contrast, chaos obscures potentially significant change, unless the new behavior facilitates consistency, in which case that new patter becomes the foreground, thus becoming the new center of attention."
<br>"Rewriting family scripts follows the sequence of a scripted pattern giving way to some improvisation followed by the establishment of a new pattern."
<br>"Family scripts can be defined as the family's shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts."

<br>The term 'expectations' implies anticipation of what is to be said and done within family relationships, as well as family pressures to perform the roles as expected. If one member fails to perform in the prescribed way, another member of the family may be recruited to take up that role instead. 

<br>The plot is 'scripted' while the cast can change. 




<br>Family scripts are revealed when repeating patterns of family interaction are either observed or described.
<br>Family Scenario:

<br>An encounter of which it can be said that something significant happens within family relationships. 
<br>Basic elements of family scenario:

<br>Context

<br>Families engaging with each other around a particular task or situation


<br>Plot

<br>Family members 'motives' become clear as the scenario unfolds


<br>Outcome

<br>The consequences of the encounter are revealed




<br>The expected scenarios for each particular family situation thread together to create an overall script for how all family relationships are expected to be conducted in general. 
<br>"Problem Scenarios":

<br>Instead called 'Attempted Solution Scenarios'

<br>This helps us to focus attention on how each person tries to solve the problem. 
<br>The behavior that is experienced now as problematic may have started out as an attempted solution to an earlier problem. 
<br>The co-constructed story may then become part of the family beliefs about what to expect of itself. 






<br><br>
<br>Improvising implies abandoning the set script and extemporizing instead. This may happen when the old script does not fit the current situation, or when those involved are in sear of something different.
<br>The therapist can help to create a new co-constructed scenario by suggesting a goal which the family then achieves in their own way. 
<br>Suggest a scenario in which it becomes necessary for the family to improvise. (in two parent families, the parents should devise a strategy together)
<br>Try to block each move that has not worked in the past. 
<br>Unraveling some of the origins of the scripted scenarios frees families to explore new pathways. Work on the present and the past can reinforce each other. 
<br><br>
<br>Replicated Scripts

<br>Parents with their own individual scenarios from childhood that are repeated


<br>Corrective Scripts

<br>Choice of the opposite style of parenting


<br>Improvised scripts

<br>Corrective scripts repeated over time


<br><br>
<br>The therapist's background also plays a part in shaping scenarios in therapy. 
<br><br>
<br>Positive Labeling

<br>Can be given to replicative scrips by labeling them as being loyal to the family of origin. 


<br>Corrective scripts can be given a positive frame by pointing out to parents that they are struggling to provide a better experience for their children than their parents were able to provide for them. 

<br>Improvised scripts (unlike the historical replicative and corrective scripts) are written in response to current situations. They are improvised either out of necessity or driven by curiosity and a wish to explore new ways of relating. 

<br>A stimulus for improvisation is a degree of uncertainty about what to do next so that interaction must be played off the cuff. 


<br>Positive comments can be made about how much the family is exploring unknown territory. 


<br><br>
<br>Attachment behavior

<br>The behavior of a person seeking proximity to his or her attachment figure in a potentially dangerous situation. (This is a mechanism that protects children - or adults - when vulnerable)
<br>The child uses the parent as a safe base from which to explore, and parent and child stay in contact to ensure that they can get together in the presence of any potential danger.


<br>In terms of script theory a potentially threatening situation evokes tightly scripted behavior in which parent and child predictably got together. Exploration allows for more improvisation. 
<br>The therapist can become a temporary attachment figure to the family. The therapist must be aware of the factors that threaten the family's relationship. 
<br>Any new behavior of uncertain origin emerging in a relationship (e.g., unexplained impatience) might be seen as either strange and treated as potentially dangerous, or novel and will arouse curiosity. 

<br>If it is perceived as strange, attempts may be made to avoid reprovoking the impatience, returning to old familiar ways instead. 
<br>If the impatience arouses curiosity, then it will probably lead to trying to discover what it is all about, and to improvise ways of dealing with it. 
<br>If it becomes clear that the impatience poses a problem and something has to be done about it, new solutions may be improvised out of the necessity to sort things out. 


<br>There are two main forms of improvisation in family relationships:

<br>Improvisation that comes out of necessity (Something has to be done when old solutions are not working)
<br>Improvisation out of curiosity when it feels safe to try something new, even if it is uncertain where it will lead. 


<br>A therapist who is trusted by the family can make the risks involved in improvisation feel less frightening, even when family relationships are insecure.

Psychoanalytic Models of Family Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Most psychoanalytic models are based on Freud's idea around the identity, ego and super ego, or the development of self. For Freud the drives were sexual (in terms of possession and control), for newer psychoanalytic ideas the drives are more around connection and validation of the self (good or bad).
<br>Object Relations Theory in some ways provides a bridge between psychodynamic theory and systems theory. We relate to people in the present based on expectations formed by early experience. 
<br>Normal Development (?)

<br>Early development is based on attachment theory/separation-individuation constructs. 
<br>Infant is born ready to be in a reciprocal relationship. This is activated by relating to a parent, by being loved and loving. 
<br>Stages of development based on object relations: internal object (mental image of self and other, and self in relation to other). 


<br><br>
<br>Objectless (primary narcissism/autistic) there is no other, only self. 
<br>The following stages focus on the development of self through relations with internal and external objects: first the actual interactions and then the unconscious residue of the interactions. 
<br>As humans, we exist in the context of relationships not as single units: There is no self without an object, there is no object without a self. 
<br>Infants develop in a context of concentric 'holding environments.' As infants internalize the guarding, protecting, soothing and nurture of this 'holding environment' they begin to form a self (even if the environment is inadequate).
<br>These early experiences then form our 'unconscious' drives for connection or separation. 'Real' others are 'used' to satisfy those drives, and we find others to validate our sense of self (good or bad).
<br><br>
<br>Health: achieving and preserving psychic wholeness through good object relations, integrating our 'unconscious' with our consciousness. 
<br>Self and its relationships with others rest on and are expressed by the degree to which relations between the self and object are gratifying (but some theorists would suggest that since we are so narcissistic in the beginning, the relationships with others are never gratifying enough. Is it possible to be healthy?)
<br><br>
<br>Fairbairn suggest that as we internalize objects we are inevitably disappointed by them, in order to defend against this pain, we do the follow:

<br>We split off those aspects that are too painful to be tolerated.
<br>Repress these intolerable aspects. 
<br>This modifies the ego.


<br>Pathology occurs when some aspects of the repressed self-object system are excessively repressed, leaving the central self depleted with an impoverished relationship to the 'ideal object.'
<br>Other forms of pathology occur when the central self system is taken over by one of the usual repressed systems, such as those whose relations are characterized by continual patterns of distance and rage with the apparent disappearance of reality. 
<br>Fear-dictated flight from early object relations is also considered the deepest root of psychological problems. 
<br><br>
<br>Skynner (1981)

<br>Diffuse boundaries
<br>Unclear identities
<br>Satisfaction from fantasy as opposed to reality
<br>Difficulty coping with separation and loss
<br>Attempts to preserve past states of relationships
<br>Attempts to manipulate others into rigidly held views of them


<br><br>
<br>The major goal of Object Relations Theory is to free family members of unconscious restrictions so that they will be able to interact with one another as whole, healthy persons on the basis of current realities rather than unconscious images. 

<br>The encounter between the therapist and client is the intervention. The relationship is the crucible for change and growth. 
<br>The therapeutic process is the same as 'normal development' during infancy. The therapist provides the holding environment, contains/introjects the clients' emotions, resolves them, understands them, somehow makes them acceptable, and then the client introjects the resolution of the emotions. Therapist projects back a 'corrective experience.'
<br>Self of therapist is key: 

<br>Transference and counter-transference are the keystones of any psychoanalytic therapy, meaning the therapist must constantly be aware of who they are' for the client, and who the client is for them. 


<br>Change occurs through insight and working through. 
<br>Techniques: 

<br>Listening
<br>Empathy
<br>Interpretation and maintaining neutrality with respect to what or how things change




<br><br>
<br>Big Picture (how families operate/develop):

<br>He uses attachment theory as a base. Early attachment relationships create 'working models' of how relationships are supposed to be, they create 'scripts.' as people interact with each other to become a family, they create their own 'family script' based on these early 'working models.' families have attachment patterns that are full of meanings about abandonment, engulfment, intrusion, etc. (i.e., distance regulation)
<br>These scripts provide routines for family life which can be followed automatically. They are shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.
<br>These scripts may be carried out from generation to generation in one form or another. Some use replicative scripts (repeat what has happened in the past), while others use corrective scripts (trying not to repeat scripts from the family of origin). There is a constant tension between these two. 
<br>Healthy vs. Dysfunctional families

<br>Healthy families have scripts that provide a set of roles with which each member can identify and which provides room for improvisation when facing new situations. These scripts promote interactional awareness:

<br>Consequences of interaction
<br>Self-awareness (why you are acting in a particular way)
<br>Empathic awareness (why others are acting in particular ways)
<br>Understanding the meaning of the interaction
<br>Shared coherent perception of what is happening






<br><br>
<br>Symptoms occur when there is difficulty updating scripts. They may occur because the script necessary remains someone or something too painful to relive. Intolerable information is blocked or edited both intraphysically and interpersonally (secrets)\
<br>Symptoms may also occur when a family script is used to prevent what members may fear to be an even worse disaster. Even though the current script is painful, it is rigidly clung to (the solution has become to problem)
<br><br>
<br>Major goal is improvisation (flexibility). In order to create an environment safe enough to explore options however, the therapist must provide a secure base from which to explore. Paradoxically, scripts, although repetitive, provide the background against which change can occur. 
<br>Attachment notions

<br>Secure
<br>Curious
<br>Improvisation
<br>Uncertainty
<br>Insecure
<br>Avoid strangeness
<br>Stick with the familiar


<br><br>
<br>Instead of conflict in the family arising out of one person's pathology which extends to influence another's behavior, family scripts are encoded in all family members' minds, but each family member plays a particular role. Therefore, each member of the family can be taught to see how their role contributes to the problem, rather than asking the 'sick one' to reown the bad object and working through these issues. 
<br><br>
<br>Reduce strategies that undermine problem-solving abilities (i.e., triangulating, scapegoating, etc.)
<br>Reduce strategies that undermine security (threats about leaving, control, etc.)
<br>Move toward collaboration rather than coercion and blame. 
<br>Re-edit scripts so the roles are fillable by the individuals in the family. 
<br>Move closer to an ideal script in which a wide scope of improvising is possible. 
<br>Develop a hopeful script. 
<br>Promote ownership of family's success, attributable to them not you as the therapist. 
<br><br>
<br>This is still important for the therapist to attend to. The therapist needs to contain the family's emotions in a way so as not to become another player in their script. Therapists own scripts can also be replayed, thus it is essential that the therapist understand their own family script. Byng-Hall outlines methods for staying out of the script and for containing emotional impact:

<br>Staying out:

<br>Use teams, get supervision, have a clear plan, use circular questioning
<br>Containing:

<br>Reflecting on the process, seeing emotions as valuable information, differentiating your script from the family's, share your emotional experience with the family. 






<br><br>
<br>Absolves people of responsibility for their behavior (it is my mother's fault)
<br>Lack of empirical testing
<br>Tautological thinking:

<br>Make an interpretation, it is rejected, patient is resistant, you must be onto something. 


<br>Perspective is individualist or dyadic without revision. 
<br>Deterministic, linear thinking (it is my mother's fault)
<br>Blaming the victim (you put yourself in this situation, because of what your mother did)
<br>Mother blaming
<br>Long process

<br>How do families operate?
<br>How do families develop?
<br><br>
<br>Symptoms:

<br>What is different about families that are 'healthy' and families that develop symptoms?
<br>How do symptoms develop?

<br>They would not be repeated if it was not supported by the system. 




<br><br>
<br>How can we intervene to change the way the family operates given the theory?
<br>What is the focus of the intervention?

<br>Is it having them act in a certain way? What is the focus?
<br>We don't teach them about theory specifically, we are wanting to change behavior

<br>Could include attachment styles here or other psychodynamic constructs


<br><br>

<br><br>
<br>This is the cornerstone construct for Nagy's work. 
<br>Trust
<br>Loyalty (split, invisible)
<br>Entitlement (destructive)
<br>All of these influence justice and fairness in relationships and are transmitted through generations. 
<br><br>
<br>Ontic: 'I-Thou' relationship, or dialogue
<br><br>
<br>Revolving Slate, justice and fairness

<br>All humans have worth and should be provided with 'due care.'
<br>When we don't get the care we deserve we develop symptoms
<br>We develop destructive entitlement which continues the cycle. 


<br><br>
<br>Multidirected partiality
<br>Acknowledgement/accountability/crediting
<br>Exoneration
<br>Therapist use of self: you need to believe/live the theory and examine your own entitlements. 
<br><br>
<br>Family Transaction &amp; Power
<br>Relational Fairness/Ethical Dimension
<br>Ontic
<br>Facts
<br>Psychology
<br><br>
<br>Dimension II:

<br>Strong emotional reactions (anger, shame)
<br>Behaviors (control-seeking or chaotic/risky) 

<br>Nay point to a destructive entitlement. As humans, we are born with value and are entitled to do care. When we do not get that, we develop a destructive entitlement. We seek others to meet our needs. We treat our partner as an object rather than a person in a relationship. 




<br>Dimension III (Transactions):

<br>Rigid or chaotic structures
<br>Power struggles
<br>High conflicts
<br>Conflicts over 'nothing'


<br><br>
<br>Violation of trust

<br>


<br>Destructive entitlement

<br>


<br>Parentification

<br>Parent using the child to get the parents do care needs met. 


<br>Overgiving

<br>Over functioning, one of the partners decides what is wrong and how to fix it. They decide what is wrong with the other person and how they need to fix it. Getting into someone else's lane.


<br>Not making 'claims'

<br>People not claiming self. People not holding themselves accountable.


<br>Loyalty conflicts or its 'invisibility'

<br>


<br><br>
<br>Restoring trust and balance of fairness in relationships
<br>Opening relational resources
<br>Opening a dialogue about fairness
<br>Direct address
<br>Presenting options 
<br>Enhancing an individual's capacity to consider the needs of others and acknowledgement of their acts
<br>Enhancing an individual's capacity to stand up for his/her own needs and to do self-validation through acts
<br>Earned merit and due consideration = balance
<br><br>
<br>Not neutral 

<br>Multidirected Partiality

<br>Not being neutral, being multidirectedly partial that you acknowledge each person's perspective and saying 'I get it. I understand why you may think that way.' You want the couples to learn how to validate someone else's perspective. Not agreeing with it, but just expanding the ability for a person to have compassion for others. Getting couples to ask for what 
<br>You have been with me long enough you should know. Opening up of relational issues. 
<br>People cannot be in a relationship and give nothing. Keep looking for their contribution. Want couples to validate each other and themselves. 
<br>As people acknowledge that other people make contributions (due consideration), we feel that we are getting the due consideration. 


<br>For couples therapy - considering


<br>Transitional
<br>Nonjudgmental
<br>Facilitating - 'sowing seeds and opening doors' and giving moratorium

<br>But - therapy still can be 'short-term'


<br>Avoids becoming parentified
<br>Therapists' own relational histories may resonate with those of their clients

<br>'Self-of-the-therapist' issues may prevent clinicians from keeping a balanced stance towards members of the family
<br>Therapist does not need to be liked by their clients. Why is it so important that your clients like you? Should your clients get better for you to be a good therapist?


<br><br>
<br>Child maltreatment
<br>Blended families
<br>Adoption and foster care
<br>Couple relationships
<br>Anger issues
<br>Depression
<br>Self-esteem
<br>Self-destrucitve behaviors and substance abuse

<br>Assess on 4 dimensions

<br>Facts, individual psychology, family transactions, relational ethics
<br>Acknowledge past - identify transgenerational revolving slates

<br>Develop effective dialogue skills


<br>Make explicit relational ethics, i.e., power imbalances, broken trust
<br>Make explicit issues involving family-of-origin

<br>Destructive entitlement
<br>Split loyalties


<br>Deparentification
<br>Exoneration


<br><br>
<br>Integration:

<br>Solidify constructive entitlement

<br>Reinforce in calm environent

<br>Balance give and take
<br>Enhanced trust


<br>Continue work with exoneration
<br>Highlight new strengths and resources
<br>plan for the future




<br><br>
<br>De-escalation and soothing
<br>Acknowledgement of the other:

<br>Of reality, points of view
<br>Deeds


<br>Good starting point: "Do you see any truth in her/his words"

<br>Acknowledgement of the self (instead of 'why')
<br>Claiming considerations
<br>Repairing past unfairness
<br>Exploring family of origin model of fairness
<br>Creating a couple's new fairness:

<br>Repair and negotiation




<br><br>
<br>How did your childhood experiences shape your model of what you owe and deserve and your beliefs about love and fairness?
<br>Does love in your family permit you to question what's unfair? (p. 108)
<br>How does your unfinished business play out in your expectations of yourself and your partner? (pg. 112)
<br>What did your parents appreciate about you? (pg. 127)
<br>What happened when you protested unfairness (pg. 133)
<br><br>
<br>Parental accountability and responsibility
<br>Restoration of fairness between generations of adults (parents and grandparents) benefits children
<br>Assessing and addressing:

<br>Loyalty issues
<br>Fairness
<br>Parentification


<br>Checking and restoring age-appropriate balance of 'give and take'
<br>It is desireable to restore relationships with parents even who abused their children because it is a way to self-freedom
<br><br>
<br>Who was there for you? When you needed someone, who did you turn to?
<br>Who did your parent (s) turn to during times of need?
<br>Who did your parent (s) confide in most?
<br>Whom were you able to rely on in times of need?
<br>Whom were your parents able to rely on in times of need?
<br>Whom could you trust in your family to see your best interests?
<br>Whom could your parents trust in the family/their parents to seek their best interests?
<br>Have you ever felt betrayed by any of your family members?
<br>Have you heard from your parents or other family members that they felt betrayed or unsupported by the family?

<br>Myth of Fusion: 

<br>Human's must come to grips with 'aloneness.' Once we accept our aloneness then we have to make meaning for our lives. 
<br>"We believe people who love us should 'just know' what we need."
<br>We have to accept we are a self. Once we accept our aloneness, we must make meaning of our lives. 


<br>Freedom and Responsibility
<br>Humanistic Psychology:

<br>Humans are good and move toward growth if unhindered. 


<br><br>
<br>Whitaker and others claim to be a-theoretical. However, Whitaker was a systems theorist and used ideas from humanistic psychology and psychoanalytic theory to guide his therapy. 
<br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a> thought he could change a family behind a mirror by telling a therapist what to do. Experiential therapists did not believe this is true. They want the family to be open to their emotional experience and thoughts they are having. 
<br>Anti-Technician:

<br>Rather than a-theoretical, Whitaker and other experiential therapists are anti-technician. Manipulation does not encourage open experiencing. 


<br><br>
<br>Through feeling expression, families are able to balance separateness and connectedness. 
<br><br>
<br>Always 'becoming' or moving forward, toward growth. 
<br>Emotions/affect are validated and nurtured. Rules create balance: respect for affect and getting along. 
<br>Permeable boundaries which encourage expression of intimacy needs, differentiation, bonding, conflict expression/resolution, problem solving, and playfulness. 
<br><br>
<br>Symptoms develop when affect is blocked, impulses are denied and feelings are suppressed. 
<br>Boundaries and processes are rigid: holding themselves together is more important than experiencing life. 
<br>Superficial experience of emotion, self-denial, lack of empathy, lack of commitment, inability to handle conflict
<br>Little awareness, little sense of choice, flow of behavior is blocked because of unexpressed emotion.
<br><a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> suggested that there were 3 contexts to our symptoms:

<br>'Driven Crazy' in an interpersonal context in which person is belittled or disqualified.
<br>'Going Crazy' a state of temporary disorganization.
<br>'Acting Crazy' an adaptation to the context.


<br><br>
<br>Increased personal integrity, greater freedom of choice, less dependence, expanded experiencing. 
<br>Strengthening the family as a system by increasing connectedness within the nuclear family and across generations. Enhance ability to support the completion of developmental tasks. 
<br><br>
<br>Battle for Structure
<br>Battle for Initiative
<br>Working Phase
<br>Termination
<br>Use of non-rational, symbol, and metaphor. 
<br>Use of self is paramount: any technique comes from the therapist's creativity. 
<br>Create a new therapeutic environment to alter the family's interaction in hopes of producing a different affective experience. 
<br>Interrupt rigid, repetitive cycles
<br>Activate and allow for constructive anxiety or confusion. 
<br>Expand the presenting problem
<br>Encourage and support any new decision (freedom to choose). 
<br>Create trans-generational boundaries. 
<br>Create a therapeutic supra-system in which the therapist and family are aligned, and the therapist still has the ability to differentiate (get in and get out).
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Self-Worth:

<br>How people learn to be people


<br>Communication:

<br>The ways people use to work out meaning with one another (Placating, Blaming, Computing, Distracting, Leveling/Congruence)

<br>Placating (peacekeeper)
<br>Blamer (im not happy its your fault)
<br>Computing (have to have a rational explanation, ultra rationale)
<br>Distracting (acts out when there is stress, someone who uses humor)
<br>Leveling/Congruence 




<br>Rules:

<br>The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into the family system. 
<br>Freedom to comment:

<br>What can you say
<br>To whom can you say it
<br>How do you go about it if you disagree or disapprove of someone or something
<br>How do you question when you do not understand
<br>Taboo subjects
<br>Taboo feelings
<br>Expressing affection
<br>Secrets


<br>Overarching goal may be to loosen up the system so there is freedom to comment. Maybe you say it yourself, maybe use family sculpting, 


<br>Link to Society:

<br>How the family interacts with the outside world


<br><br>
<br>When communication patterns are rigid (other than congruence) and continual, and you can't comment on that.
<br>Symptoms are symptoms of the system
<br>Symptoms are created through the process of interaction
<br><br>
<br>Low self-worth
<br>Communication is indirect, vague, not honest
<br>Rules are rigid and non-negotiable
<br>Link to society is fearful, placating, and blaming
<br><br>
<br>Congruence (you the therapist must be congruent) (as a therapist, when you have a sense of what is going on in the room, you say it<br>
“Recording 20240412103404.webm” could not be found.<br>
)<br>
- Only with congruence can we know each other fully and we can use our differences creatively. 
<br>Focus of intervention

<br>Helping people change and grow in:

<br>Communication
<br>Beliefs about being able to grow
<br>Restoring the use of all the senses




<br>Therapist use of self is key (as with all experiential models)

<br>To alleviate symptoms you have to intervene in the process in a way that won't replicate their process.


<br>Conditions for Chage

<br>Trust
<br>Development of awareness
<br>Development of understanding
<br>Development of awareness of options
<br>Practice


<br>Universal goal for all families

<br>Development of self-worth
<br>Freedom to comment


<br><br>
<br>Techniques should emerge from the therapist/client interaction. 
<br>Techniques are only useful in a context of trust.

<br>How do families operate?
<br>How do families develop?
<br><br>
<br>What is different about families that are 'healthy' and families that develop symptoms?
<br>How do symptoms develop?
<br><br>
<br>Given the theoretical conceptualizations from the first two sections, how can we intervene to change the way the family operates?
<br>What is the focus of these interventions (i.e., insight, feelings, interaction patters, behavior, cognition)? You should use several examples of techniques to provide illustrations of this. 
<br><br>
<br>In this section, you are free to state your opinion, as well as the opinions of others. There are several assignments that critique the theories, you are also free to search for these critiques elsewhere. You need to support your critiques with literature. You should include culture/ethnicity, family structure (intact vs. Non-intact, or other alternative family forms) and gender issues. 
<br>I also encourage you to look at the way the theory is presented in the eyes of a beginning study of therapy and explore the possible 'dangers' that accepting a theory 'hook, line, and sinker' may create.

<br>(1912-1995) <a data-href="Modeling" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/modeling.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Modeling</a>

<br>He was born in upstate New York and grew up on a dairy farm. He went to Syracuse University where he earned his M.D. in 1936. Whitaker first went into obstetrics and gynecology, but then switched to become a psychiatrist. 
<br>During WWII, he worked in Oak Ridge, Tennessee (top-secret project developing the atomic bomb was located). 
<br>He was mainly self-taught which made his take on a co-therapist, which became a mainstay of his practice. 
<br>In 1946, Whitaker was named chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University. 
<br>In 1956, he and colleagues opened the Atlanta Psychiatric clinic, a private practice where his approach, <a data-href="Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/symbolic-experiential-family-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy</a>, was further developed. 
<br>In 1965, Whitaker moved back into academia, taking a position in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin. 
<br>Books include The Family Crucible and Dancing with the Family


<br>Psychology of the Absurd (1975)

<br>Blend of warm support and emotional goading.


<br>Around Whitakers time, psychologically troubled people were seen as alienated from feeling and frozen into devitalized routines. 
<br>He worked with John Warkentin in 1943 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
<br>He pioneered the use of co-therapy in belief that a supportive partner helped free the therapist to react without fear of countertransference. 
<br>Whitaker never seems to have an obvious strategy and did not use predictable techniques. He let his unconscious run therapy. He believed all interventions promoted flexibility. He challenged the family to open up and become more fully themselves and more fully together. 
<br>Whitaker organized a series of forums which eventually led to the Convention of Family Therapy Movement.

<br>In 1946, Whitaker began twice yearly conferences where clinicians observed and discussed work with families. 


<br>He developed mutual observation and using one-way mirrors which became a hallmark of family therapy. 
<br>In 1955, Whitaker entered a private practice at the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic and developed experiential-form of psychotherapy, treating families, individuals, groups, and couples. 
<br>In the late 70 s, Whitaker mellowed out and added greater understanding of family dynamics.

 <br>Clinical Psychologist<br>
Prevention of OUD: The HOME (Housing, Opportunities, Motivation, and Engagement)<br>
<br>Problem with research not being done on a wide scale with homeless youth.
<br>NIH Heal Initiative (preventing opioid use disorder in older adolescents and young adults)
<br>Testing CFT with adolescents as a treatment plan (1990s)
<br>Engaging the family is difficult when child has to leave
<br>Leaving justice system that have no where to go. 
<br>Individual interventions rather than using any relational therapy
<br>Most kids on the streets deal with substance use. Mostly interested in giving the children a foundation to stand upon. Stability. 
<br>Vulnerable populations (adolescents and emerging adults)
<br>How much is this children not knowing the resources that exist to help them<br>
<br>
Some grants require you to work with other researchers on their projects who received the grant. Everyone collects data, have to make rules to what to do with the data, can be tedious. 

<br>
Youth experiencing (Poly-drug users) homelessness (YEH) have extremely high rates of substance use and other risks

<br>
2-5 million YEH in the US (not rare), likely bearing the greatest burden from the epidemic. Replicable, evidence-based preventive interventions that comprehensively address these youth's range of needs are not established. While shelters are often the 'front door' or first contact for service provision among homeless populations, most of those under 24 years do not reach the shelter system. 

<br>
in 2022, the overdose death rate in Ohio in 38.3 deaths out of every 100,000 residents. This is 85% higher than the national average OD death rate. 

<br>
US has also seen a rapid increase in opioid use among youth, which has been described as the most alarming drug use trend.  

<br>
Compared to housed youth:

<br>YEH Have significantly higher rates of substance use, physical and mental health problems
<br>YEH have 12 times higher mortality rate


<br>
Reports indicate that only 10% of YEH in need of services access available services. 

<br>
Black persons make up 13% of the population, but 40% of the homeless population

<br>
Black youth have 83% higher change of reporting homelessness than their White peers. 

<br>
Being Black is associated with a lower likelihood of finding permanent housing, with White families 1.9 times more likely to find housing than black families. 

<br>
Youth identifying as sexual and/or gender minorities (SGM) are also overrepresented in the homeless population (40%)

<br>
Housing First:

<br>Prevent opioids use disorder (OUD) and other risk behaviors associated with living on the streets, Housing First interventions may be necessary, as well as linkage to a range of services
<br>Housing First is the name given to the philosophical approach that housing is a basic human right, and housing before or concurrent with other interventions make those interventions more effective. 
<br>Having autonomy to make choices and decisions for oneself
<br>Do not take away housing if struggling with substance abuse/use or mental health


<br>
Prior prevention work:

<br>The odds of recent hard drugs use among HIV positive adults experiencing homelessness were four times higher when they remained homeless. 
<br>Those who obtained housing were half as likely to use hard drugs and needs, to share needs, and engage in unprotected sex. 


<br>
Engagement Challenges:

<br>Services available but youth cannot or will not access them
<br>Unless there's active outreach and meeting youth where they are, youth trying to live day to day will not take advantage of prevention services. 
<br>Youth often feel by betrayed by the system and its representatives. 
<br>18-24 are told to go to adult center
<br>14-18 are sent to shelters


<br>
Strengths-Based Outreach Approach includes following deatures:

<br>Use paraprofessional personnel
<br>A focus on client strengths rather than deficits
<br>A high degree of responsibility give t the client in directing and influencing the intervention that they receive from the system


<br>
Motivational Interviewing (MI):

<br>Strong record of prevention in alcohol and drug problems.
<br>Demands much less of a hard-to-reach population
<br>Several studies have shown positive impact of MI on drug use among runaway and homeless youth


<br>
Prevention program / intervention description:

<br>Using a housing first philosophy 
<br>6 months of rent
<br>utility assistance


<br>
Eligibility

<br>18-24 years
<br>Youth experiences homelessness
<br>Youth fails to meet DSM-5 criteria for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)


<br>
Drug use (primarily marijuana use), showed a 35% Reduction in frequency of use

<br>While statistical significant cannot be expected with a small sample, we found statistically significant improvement
<br>no youth began opioid use during treatment


<br>
Qualitative Interviews:

<br>17 participants; overall participants reported noticing positive changes in their lives from the intervention had nothing about the project they disliked. 
<br>5 landlords interviewed; generally positive experiences with project, willing to rent to future

<br>Liked:

<br>Consistent rent payments
<br>Opportunity to help others


<br>Disliked:

<br>6-month lease (prefer full year)
<br>Problematic Tenant (one landlord) 






<br>
Phase I Summary:

<br>Lessons learned:

<br>Youth very engaged, even using remote strategies
<br>HIV session attentance poor
<br>landlord and youth experiences very good




<br>
Phase I Findings:

<br>First study to engage at risk youth experiencing homelessness into a holist opioid prevention


<br>
Phase II:

<br>Baseline Assessment -&gt; Random Assignment

<br>Housing and risk prevention services
<br>Risk prevention services along




<br>
Conclusions:

<br>Even though these youth are at high risk for OUD and overdose death and are considered difficult to engage, they CAN be engaged in m


<br>
Recommendations:

<br>Transition planning would save money and prevent drug use and suicide if youth never go to street. 
<br>Need greater funding lalocations to drop-in centers AND for opiois and other prevention services - most federal funding overall given to shelters


<br>
Housing First:

<br>If we conclude that housing is a powerful opioid prevention tool, then follows that housing for those experiencing homelessness has to be made a top priority in the drug precention world?
<br>Support Housing First (not Housing Fourth)
<br>Change rules on who is eligible for housing

<br>Rules for obtaining identification
<br>Justice record expungement to ease housing barriers


<br>Address utility arrears.

 <br>
<br>Ackerman sought out to understand a family to diagnose problems and develop family treatment. 
<br>He was a child psychiatrist. 

<br>He worked at the Menninger Clinic. 
<br>In 1937, he became the chief psychiatrist of the Child Guidance Clinic. 

<br>He followed the child guidance model of psychiatry to treat the child while the social worker saw the mother. 
<br>He began having the same therapist see both the mother and child around the 1940 s. he began to see the family as the basic unit of treatment. 




<br>In 1955, Ackerman organized the first session on family diagnosis at the Meeting of American Orthopsychiatric Association.

<br>The Family Institute was founded in 1960. 

<br>They renamed the Family Institute to Ackerman Institute following his death in 1971. 




<br>He believed, even though families may give the appearance of unity, underneath they are split into competing factors. 
<br>His ideas were similar to the <a data-href="Psychoanalytic Family Therapy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Psychoanalytic Family Therapy" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Psychoanalytic Family Therapy</a> model
<br>Despite the apparent unit of personality, families are actually minds in conflict driven by warring drives and defenses. 
<br>He believed families confront some issues while avoiding others, such as conflicts involving sex and aggression. 
<br>He saw his job as bringing the family secrets into the open. 
<br>He was unrestrained to encourage families to relax their emotional restraint. 

<br>He first sided with one member of the family and later with another. 
<br>He believed balance was achieved in the long-run by moving back and forth in giving support now to one, later to another family member. 
<br>He was described as unabashingly blunt. 
<br>He stated people get more reassurance from honesty than from false promises.

<br><br>
<br>Basic Attending Skills:

<br>Attending Behavior:

<br>Individually and culturally appropriate verbal and nonverbal behavior - culturally appropriate eye contact, vocal tone, body language, and verbal following.


<br>Questions/Open Invitation to Talk:

<br>




<br>Open vs. Closed Questions<br>
- Open questions often begin with what, how, or could. They help the client explore issues and talk at greater length.<br>
- Closed questions often begin with do, is, are, and lead to focused answers, often shorter in length.<br>
- Clarifying - Encourage, Restate, Paraphrase:<br>
- Encourages are brief responses such as head nods, "Uh-huh," and single words or phrases.<br>
- They encourage client depth exploration and bring clarity as to meaning. Appropriate smiling is one of the most important encourages.<br>
- Restatement:<br>
- In the restatement you select several key words and repeat the back exactly. It works like an encourager, but focuses in more depth on a key issue.<br>
- Paraphrase:<br>
- The paraphrase feeds back to the client the essence of what has been said. The paraphrase provides a check on the accuracy of your listening and may enable the client to move on to a new topic.<br>
- Reflection of Feeling/Responding to Emotion:<br>
- Reflection of feeling is concerned with identifying and feeding back to the client the underlying emotional experience.<br>
- Exploration of emotion is basic to understanding a client's deeper desires and wishes.<br>
- Clarifying emotion leads to better client decision making and action.<br>
- Summarization:<br>
- This skill asks you to feed back to the client the essence of longer statements or a whole interview.<br>
- Many summarizations will include descriptions of behavior, thoughts, and emotion.<br>
- This skill is useful in clarifying what has happened in key interview segments and in beginning and ending the interview.<br>
- Integration of Skills - Five Stages of the Interview:<br><br><br>
<br>Self-of-the-therapist work is the willingness of a therapist to participate in a process that requires introspective work on issues in their own life, that has an impact the process of therapy in both positive and negative ways.
<br>Self-of-the-therapist work should focus on life events in such a way that therapists are able to see their past experiences as both potential obstacles and potential strengths.
<br><br>
<br>How do your life experiences help you to be more compassionate to your clients?
<br>How do your life experiences allow you to understand your clients on a deeper level?
<br>How can you use your previous life experiences to inform your work?
<br><br>
<br>What issues in therapy are 'too close to home'?
<br>How are issues 'getting in the way'?
<br>What are potential 'blind spots' in the therapy room?
<br><br>
<br>Using a Both/And Perspective:

<br>Discuss themes in terms of how they could get in the way of successful therapy and how it helps you become a better therapist.
<br>Celebrate experiences not just pathologize them. 


<br><br>
<br>Establish:

<br>Establish safety


<br>Strive:

<br>Strive for a balanced perspective that is inclusive of gender and culture. 


<br>Process:

<br>Process therapist/supervisor and colleague/colleague relationships.


<br>Be:

<br>Be aware of dual-relationships.


<br><br>
<br>My Therapy House:

<br>Foundation:

<br>The things you bring to graduate school, self-of-the-therapist, who you are, what you stand for, experiences that shape you.


<br>House:

<br>This is your theory, items about your theory that fit with your foundation (should be seamless and purposeful) (worldview)


<br>Roof:

<br>Borrowed techniques from other theories that fit with your population of interest, theory, self-of-the-therapist.


<br>Chimney:

<br>How you evaluate that what you are doing is helpful, and your self-care plan.




<br><br>
<br>A process in which the therapist initiates a conversation with a family about similarities and differences in their key identities, such as race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and religion, and how they may potentially influence the therapy process.
<br>Location of self begins with the therapist engaging in self-disclosure but continues beyond.
<br><br>
<br>The revelation of personal rather than professional information about the therapist to the client. 
<br>When therapist disclosure goes beyond the standard professional disclosure of name, credentials, office addresses, fees, office policies, etc., it becomes self-disclosure.
<br>Appropriate clinically driven self-disclosures carried out for the clinical benefit of the clients and unavoidable (non-harming).
<br>Self-disclosure that takes place in the community are considered boundary crossings.
<br>Inappropriate self-disclosures are considered a boundary violation.

<br>Self-disclosure done for the benefit of the therapist
<br>Clinically counter-indicated disclosures that burden the client with unnecessary information or creates a role reversal where a client takes care of the therapist. 


<br>Different types of self-disclosure:

<br>Deliberate:

<br>Self-revealing
<br>Self-involving


<br>Unavoidable
<br>Accidental
<br>Clients' deliberate actions


<br>
<br>What is the therapist's intent?
<br>The decision to self-disclose is based first and foremost on the welfare of the client. 
<br>Intentional and deliberate self-disclosure is made under the general moral and ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence

<br>Circular Questioning<br><br><br>
<br>A method of interviewing developed by the Milan Associates in which questions are asked that highlight differences among family members. (<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/research-citations/books/@nicholsfamilytherapyconcepts2019.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019</a>)

<br><br>
<br>"A person cannot do right in one department of life while attempting to do wrong in another department." - Gandhi
<br><br>
<br>What is a system?

<br>A set of objects (elements) that interrelate to form a whole
<br>Closed System: no interchange with its environment (doesn't apply to social systems)
<br>Open System: One that receives matter and energy from its environment (applies to communication).
<br>Consists of:

<br>Objects, or parts, elements, or members of the system

<br>These parts may be physical or abstract.


<br>System consists of attributes.
<br>Internal relationships among its objects (mutual effects).
<br>An environment. They are affected by their surroundings. 


<br>Wholeness and Interdependence:

<br>In a system, the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
<br>It is a product of the forces or interactions among its parts. 
<br>It's parts cannot be understood separately.
<br>The interdependence creates organization in the system (e.g., a family).


<br><a data-href="Hierarchy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/hierarchy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hierarchy</a>:

<br>Systems tend to be embedded within one another.
<br>Every complex system consists of subsystems. 
<br>Given that systems are within systems, it is fuzzy as to where to locate the boundary between the system and the environment. 


<br>Interchange with the Environment:

<br>Inputs and outputs.
<br>The system affects and is affected by the environment. 
<br>Balance (<a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>)

<br>Self-maintenance
<br>Sensing deviations from the norm and correcting those 'faults.'




<br>Self-Regulation and Control:

<br>Systems are often viewed as goal-oriented.
<br>They are governed by their purposes. 
<br>The parts operate according to guidelines and adapt to the environment on the basis of feedback. 
<br>This aspect of system functioning is cybernetics. 


<br>Change and Adaptability:

<br>The system must adapt to its environment. 


<br>Equifinality:

<br>A particular final state may be achieved in different ways. 




<br>Family as a System:

<br>This model of a family as a system is extrapolated from the work of <a data-href="Ludwig von Bertalanffy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a> and his <a data-href="General Systems Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/general-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">General Systems Theory</a>.
<br>Holons:

<br>A single cell is made up of holons, just as a family is made up of individuals.

<br>Major Assumptions:

<br>Modern vs. Post Modern

<br>Level of analysis is the family or larger context. 


<br>The observer remains outside the system. 
<br>There is a particular way families 'should' behave. 
<br>Reality is objective.

<br>Interaction with (vs. control of) mechanism
<br>Observer's implication in the system


<br>Major Assumptions:

<br>Main difference is that the observer is a part of the system. 
<br>Reality is self-referential (i.e., everything we know and see is based on our personal frame of reference). 
<br>No reference to an outside environment. 




<br>More to a System:

<br>Bounded:

<br>A cell has a '<a data-href="Feedback Loop" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/feedback-loop.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Feedback Loop</a>,' enabling information to be transferred throughout the cell. All families have such a loop or <a data-href="Process" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a> for communicating. 


<br>Interdependent:

<br>All holons are interdependent on each other. Change one and you change the system. The same holds true of individuals in the family system. 


<br><a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>:

<br>All cells expend energy to maintain a steady state or homeostasis. This explains the difficulty of change within family systems. 
<br>This thinking moves from linear causality to a more multi-dimensional approach to families. 
<br>From A-&gt;B-&gt;C to interconnections between A, B, and C. 






<br>Core Concepts:

<br>Problems:

<br>Understanding Problems:

<br>Your Clinical Theory
<br>Learning Problems vs. Problems about Learning
<br>Problems as Bad Solutions
<br>Problems arising from childhood wounds, outmoded, limiting coping styles
<br>Problems arising from Larger Societal Changes (and Issues)


<br>The Presenting Problem:

<br>A presenting problem is an initial symptom that causes a person to seek professional help. 
<br>Describe the reason the client came to you. 
<br>Include the client's definition of their problem. 

<br>How long they've been experiencing the issue. 






<br>Process: 

<br>Understanding Process:

<br><a data-href="Content" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/content.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Content</a>:

<br>Stories about what happened; shared at length and with extraneous details


<br><a data-href="Process" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>:

<br>Access the client's internal experience and working through parts of it. 
<br>Process Questions in Therapy:

<br>When a client is discussing something important to them tell the initial story and listen until your client invites you to help them. Otherwise, and after initial sessions you should mostly ask '<a data-href="Process" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/process.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Process</a>' questions that:

<br>Focus on the client themselves and their internal experience
<br>Help the client 'slow down' and reflect on ideas or feelings that seem significant
<br>Use immediacy to ask about emotions you're noticing in a moment
<br>Focus on themes, patterns, and affect


<br>Example of Process Questions in Therapy:

<br>"What is it like for you when..."
<br>"I might be off here, but were you feeling... in that moment?"
<br>When you notice heightened emotion, you can ask, "What's coming up for you right now?", "How are you feeling, talking to me about this?"
<br>"What do you wish other people knew about what you are experiencing?"
<br>"Today or in our previous sessions, have you found yourself thinking 'I wish they'd ask me about....?" "What question do you need someone to ask you, that no one has?"
<br>"How did that make you feel about yourself, about your partner, about the relationship?"
<br>"What you just mentioned about X seems important, at least to me. Could we slow down and stay with this idea/feeling for a moment?"










<br>Patterns:

<br>Observable repeated behavior, thoughts, or interaction that often manifest in human interaction and may manifest in therapy sessions. 

<br>For example, a client may have a patter of shutting down emotionally or becoming distracted whenever you approach painful material. 


<br>Writing a Systemic Hypothesis:

<br>Circular Questioning:

<br>Circular questioning is a technique used in systemic family therapy to 'invite participants in a conversation to consider relational aspects of the topic being investigated.'

<br>Ask open questions to explore communication and relationship patterns


<br>Types of Circular Questions:

<br>Bridging the Past:

<br>Circular questions bridge the past and the present together to find a moment in time when a shift in the family occurred. If this moment can be identified, it can give clues as to how to help the family. 

<br>Has conflict always happened like this in your family?
<br>What was it like before?
<br>When did it start happening like this?




<br>Thirds: 

<br>Circular questioning often asks a third person for their thoughts on how a dyad operates. This often breaks an unspoken rule in families that states, 'We don't comment about others.'


<br>This technique invites reflection on how two people's actions impact the behavior or mood of another. These questions are often used to assess how families respond to their members in different situations. 

<br>"Dad, when Son is showing signs of depression, what do you see Mom do?"
<br>"Mom, when Dad is taking care of Son, what do you think Dad gets out of?"


<br>Differences: 

<br>When a behavior occurs or a significant change occurred different family members reacted in different ways. 


<br>Circular questions help us understand the different ways people reacted and from that we can gauge how close people are, or how distant, enmeshment, and various other ideas. 

<br>How is this different than before?
<br>Who is most likely to comfort...?
<br>Who is least likely?
<br>Has this always been true?

<br>Common Factors Research in Couple and Family Therapy

<br>When two or more treatments compared to each other are designed based on a sound theory about how people change, and treatment sessions are structured to target those theoretical change processes (i.e., active treatments), there are typically very few differences in patient outcomes. 
<br>Evidence-based research on common factors has shown that relationship factors in a therapeutic dyad or group setting predict the outcome of psychotherapy. 


<br>Couple and Family Therapy Common Factors:

<br>Conceptualizing Difficulties in Relational Terms
<br>Disrupting Dysfunctional Relational Patterns
<br>Expanding the Direct Treatment System
<br>Expanding the Therapeutic 


<br>Clinical Implications of Common Factors:

<br>Practice professional modesty
<br>Choose a model you believe in
<br>Practice your model flexibly
<br>Get honest feedback
<br>Capitalize on CFT Specific Common Factors

<br>Precontemplation: 

<br>A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior; the person may be unaware that a problem exists


<br>Contemplation:

<br>The person becomes aware that there is a problem, but has made no commitment to change. 


<br>Preparation:

<br>The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change)


<br>Action:

<br>The person is in active modification of behavior. 


<br>Maintenance:

<br>Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional. 


<br>Relapse:

<br>The person falls back into old patterns of behavior. 


<br>Upward Spiral:

<br>Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating






<br>Specific Factors:

<br>Elements clearly delineated by proponents of a given therapy as the active causes of change. 




<br>Empirically Supported Relationships:

<br>Therapeutic interventions that possess empirical support for the efficacy of the therapeutic relationship, client values and beliefs, and the working alliance between client and therapist.

<br>Initial Session/Intake:

<br>Welcome Stage:

<br>Make sure participant(s) are comfortable.
<br>Review clinic policies and procedures.
<br>Address any questions.
<br>Overall Goal: Orient clients to therapy.


<br>Social Stage:

<br>Get to know the clients outside of the problem.
<br>Chat with each client briefly, asking about their occupations and interests.
<br>Goal: Begin to join and build rapport with clients


<br>Assessment State - complete Mental Status Exam, biopsychosocial assessment, and risk assessment:

<br>Begin initial assessment with the client system.

<br>This includes individual level and relational level assessment.
<br>Complete the following:

<br><a data-href="Mental Status Exam" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Mental Status Exam" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Status Exam</a>:

<br>The mental status examination is a structured assessment of the patient's behavioral and cognitive functioning.
<br>In general, the components of a mental status exam include descriptions of the following:

<br>Appearance
<br>General Behavior
<br>Speech and Language
<br>Emotions
<br>Thought and Perception

<br>A Biopsychosocial Assessment is an assessment typically conducted by therapists at the beginning of therapy, which assesses for biological, psychological, and social factors that can be contributing to a problem or problems with a client.
<br>Biopsychosocial Assessments enable therapist to diagnose and effectively treat clients.






<br>Primary Goal: Gain context to help facilitate change.

<br>Diagnose Disorders
<br>Plan Treatments
<br>Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions




<br>Establishing the Problem:

<br>Have each client state, without discussion, their view of the issue needed to be addressed in therapy.
<br>Goal: To identify the presenting problem bringing the client(s) to therapy.


<br>Investigating the Problem:

<br>Discuss the issues with the client(s) to gain more detail about the nature and context of the 
<br>You may also choose to structure a directed interaction or engagement to understand the issue more thoroughly.
<br>This is the time to add the who, what, when..., previous attempts, culture, gender, love, justice, spirituality, strengths, sequences, circular questioning, etc. 
<br>Goal: Understand the History and Contextual Factors Related to the Problem
<br>Meeting Alone:

<br>Only if appropriate, meet separately with one, or several, of the unit.




<br>Establishing Goals:

<br>Have the client(s) set short and long-term goals for the therapy.
<br>These are initial goals and can be considered tentative. 
<br>Try to work with clients to identify SMART goals. 


<br>Developing Interventions:

<br>Give the family members some task to do before the next session.
<br>This is dependent on your model or approach. This is not always applicable.


<br>Conclusion:

<br>Conclude the sessions
<br>Address any final questions
<br>Provide a summary of the main points of the session
<br>Determine if client(s)




<br>Most Basic Initial Session/Intake:

<br>Meeting Alone:

<br>If appropriate, meet separately with one, or several, of the unit.


<br>Establishing Goals:

<br>Have the client(s) set short and long-term goals for the therapy.


<br>Develop Interventions: Give the family members some task to do before the next session.

<br>This is dependent on your model or approach. This is not always applicable.


<br>Conclude the Session


<br>Basic Interviewing Techniques:

<br>Attending Behavior:

<br>Individually and culturally appropriate verbal and nonverbal behavior - culturally appropriate eye contact, vocal tone, body language, and verbal following. 


<br>Non-directive Listening Responses:
<br>Directive Listening Responses:
<br>Direction Action Responses:
<br>Skilled Use of Questions

<br>Circular Questioning:

<br>Questions that draw distinctions (broaden understanding)

<br>Across Time
<br>Between People
<br>Between Situations
<br>Between Parts of a Person


<br>Questions that draw connections (narrow focus)

<br>Behavior
<br>Feelings
<br>Beliefs
<br>Meaning

<br>Triadic Questions:

<br>Invite reflection regarding how two people's actions impact the behavior or mood of another. 

<br>eg., How does your father react when your mother cries?




<br>Mind-Reading Questions:

<br>Invite individuals to consider what someone else might think in order to explore how their relationship works.

<br>eg., If your father didn't arrive home as expected, how do you think your mother would react?












<br>Reflection

<br>Empathic Listening
<br>Reflection of Feeling
<br>Reflection to Emotion


<br>Pinpointing:
<br>Open-Ended Questions:

<br>Open Invitations to Talk
<br>Questions
<br>Open vs. Closed Questions
<br>Open questions often begin with what, how, or could. They help the client explore issues and talk at greater length.
<br>Closed questions often begin with do, is, are, and lead to focused answers, often shorter in length.


<br>Confrontation:
<br>Self-Disclosure:
<br>Silence:
<br>Reframing:
<br>Focusing:
<br>Summarization:
<br>Clarifying:

<br>How do we not make assumptions on how people feel? We can only guess, but that can come off.<br>
- Don't want to jumpt to conclusions. Allow the client to describe it. Can you tell me what it looks like for you? Use open ended questions.  using states like "I have heard people describe this before, how does it feel for you?<br>
<br>What is just suicidal ideation? 
<br>What if 
<br><br>
<br>Types of Clinical Assessment:

<br>Two broad approaches to assessment:

<br>Systemic Approach
<br>Postmodern Approach


<br>Formal Assessments:

<br>Formal assessment involves the use of tools such as tests, questionnaires, checklists and rating scales. 
<br>Formal assessments often have data to determine their reliability and validity. 
<br>Examples:

<br>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Questionnaire (GAD7) - Individual

<br>Biopsychosocial Model: “Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 10.25.48 AM.png” could not be found.
<br>A Biopsychosocial Assessment is an assessment typically conducted by therapists at the beginning of therapy, which assesses for biological, psychological, and social factors that can be contributing to a problem or problems with a client. 
<br>Biopsychosocial Assessments enable therapist to diagnose and effectively treat clients. 
<br>Tasks and Process of Assessment:

<br>Make Initial Contact
<br>Develop a collaborative therapeutic relationship
<br>Use a bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual assessment: Person-in-Environment
<br>Defining problems
<br>Assessing safety
<br>Accessing and appreciating patient/clients' strengths
<br>Assess systems collaboration issues and strengths
<br>Expand awareness and perspectives
<br>Assess goals


<br>Biopsychosocial Assessment Areas:

<br>Demographic Information (Age, Ethnicity, Religion, Relational Status, Referral Status, etc.)
<br>History of the Presenting Problem

<br>Assessment as an ongoing process




<br>


<br>Regular screening and tracking during sessions of the following:

<br>Health status
<br>Mobility
<br>Wellness

<br>Exercise
<br>Nutrition
<br>Sleep




<br>Ensure that client has primary care physician
<br>Communicate with primate care physician or other health providers as needed. 


<br>


<br>General Psychological Issues:

<br>Cognitive skills and ability (e.g.. thought process, problem-solving/decision-making skills)
<br>Behavioral skills
<br>Emotional competencies:

<br>Affect regulation
<br>Capacity for relating


<br>Motivational factors


<br>Overall mental status
<br>Risk Assessment
<br>Specific Mental Health Concerns:

<br>Depression
<br>Anxiety
<br>Substance Use


<br>Appropriate referral if needed
<br>Ongoing communication between external providers (collaboration of care)


<br>


<br>Risk Assessment includes consideration of psychological and social factors as part of a comprehensive review to capture client needs, and to assess their risk of harm to themselves or others. 
<br>Assessments often aim to categorize patients as at high, medium, or low risk
<br>Examples of risk areas include:

<br>Suicidal ideation
<br>Homicidal ideation
<br>Child abuse/neglect
<br>Intimate partner violence
<br>Physical health issues or crises

<br>Risk and protective factors




<br>


<br>Assessing Strengths:

<br>Personal and Relational Strengths:

<br>Bio-physiological
<br>Psychological
<br>Sociocultural
<br>Spiritual


<br>'Strengths' of the problem/symptoms
<br>Strengths in systems collaboration


<br>Exploring the 'Strengths' and Potential 'Contributions' of the Problem

<br>When was the last time that you realized that the problem was helpful to you?
<br>If your problem has a voice, what do you think it is trying to share or communicate with you?
<br>How might the problem be helpful to you?
<br>If we could get rid of the problem, what might be some aspect of it that you might want to retain?


<br>Useful Questions for Assessing Strengths:

<br>What has been helpful so far?
<br>What are some of your successes?
<br>What are the achievements that you are most proud of having accomplished?
<br>What little things are you doing that make life a little better for you?
<br>What kinds of things do people compliment you on?
<br>When have you stopped doing something that was difficult for you to stop?
<br>When have you made an important change in your life that was difficult to make?
<br>When have you broken a habit that was hard to break?


<br>Outcomes of Assessment:

<br>Problems:

<br>Bio-psycho-sociocultural-spiritual perspective
<br>Problem and attempted solutions specifically and behaviorally described (SOLVABLE).


<br>Goals:

<br>Desired future outcomes
<br>Specifically and behaviorally described (ATTAINABLE)
<br>Professional and the patient/client mutually agree to the described problems and goals. 


<br>Treatment plan and interventions based on mutual consensus of problem and goal

<br>David A. Jobes, Ph.D.

<br>Creator of CAMS Framework


<br>Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS)

<br>It is a therapeutic framework for suicide-specific assessment and treatment of a patient's suicidal risk. It is a flexible approach that can be used across theoretical orientations and disciplines for a wide range of suicidal patients across treatment settings and different treatment modalities. 
<br>Every session of CAMS intentionally utilizes the patient's input about what is and is not working. All assessment work in CAMS is collaborative. 

<br>The clinician's honesty and forthrightness are key elements. 

<br>The CAMS clinician endeavors to understand their patient's suffering from an empathic, nonjudgemental, and intra-subjective perspective. The clinician never shames or blames a suicidal person for being suicidal.






<br>Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments for Suicide:

<br>Three evidence-based (randomized controlled trials) interventions and treatments that are designed to directly target suicide at risk. 

<br>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
<br>Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT): 

<br>Suicide Prevention (CT-SP) and Brief CBT. 


<br>Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS)




<br>Suicide-Specific Brief Interventions:

<br>Evidence-Based (Random Controlled Trial):

<br>Teachable Moment Brief Intervention (TMBI):

<br>A one-time intervention 2 dats after an attempt.


<br>Motivational Interviewing:

<br>In-patient settings


<br>Crisis Response Planning &amp; Safety Planning (6 Steps)
<br>Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP):

<br>How do we balance knowing what we know and what our clients can teach us<br>
<br>Dialectic, expertise and balancing feedback. 

<br>Don't take things personally from clients. 
<br>How do you
<br>What would be the ideal way to approach feedback? How is it realistic? How would you like me to respond?

<br>How can we acknowledge it being received. 




<br><br>
<br>Ethical Concerns and Telehealth:

<br>Remember our ethical imperatives for in-person therapy. 
<br>Rely on common factors
<br>Rely on our professional standards of practice

<br>AAMFT Code of Ethics
<br>Coalition for Technology in Behavioral Science (CTiBS) TBH Competencies


<br>Know and adhere to legal guidelines (federal and state)
<br>Continue education and training. 
<br>Seek supervision. 


<br>Assessing Appropriateness for Telehealth:

<br>Conduct an initial assessment of the client to determine if telehealth is appropriate. 
<br>Conduct ongoing assessment to determine appropriateness to receive services via teletherapy throughout the court of treatment. 


<br>Consider:

<br>Current Mental and Emotional Status
<br>Is the treatment model conducive to telehealth?
<br>Is the current delivery of the service effective?
<br>Does the client have the technological ability and resources necessary?


<br>A client may be inappropriate for telehealth if:

<br>Recurrently experiences, or is likley to experience, crises or emergencies. 
<br>Is a suicide risk, or likely to become a suicide risk. 
<br>Has a history of previous non-suicidal self-injury. 
<br>Is violent, or likely to become violent. 




<br>Risk Management in Telehealth:

<br>Suicidality
<br>Homicidality
<br>Child Abuse/Neglect
<br>Intimate Partner Violence
<br>Animal Abuse
<br>Physical Health Issues or Crises
<br>Obtain your client's physical location at the start of each session. 

<br>Complete Address
<br>Make, Model, Color of Car
<br>Nearest Physical Location


<br>Obtain a client's emergency contact at initial intake and review regularly

<br>Physical Location
<br>Distance from the Client (nearest ETA)


<br>Obtain contact information for local emergency resources:

<br>Local police and fire departments
<br>Local Crisis Centers
<br>Family Pediatrician/PCP
<br>National Crisis Numbers




<br>Safety Assessment:

<br>Is it safe for them to return or remain home&gt;
<br>Are there weapons in the house?
<br>Are the children in danger?
<br>Is the violence escalating?
<br>Are they unwilling to complete a safety plan?
<br>Is their situation too severe and they require a higher level of care?
<br>The most important intervention a therapist can use when working with a suicidal client is compassion for the pain they are in and patience in listening to their story. 
<br>What is a Safety Plan?

<br>A safety plan is a prioritized written list of coping strategies and sources of support developed by a clinician in collaboration with clients who are at high risk for suicide. 
<br>A safety plan is not a 'no-suicide contract,' which is not recommended by experts in the field of suicide prevention. 

<br>As generally used, no-suicide contracts asks clients to promise stay alive without telling them how to stay alive. 






<br>Safety Planning:

<br>Safety planning incorporates elements of four evidence-based suicide risk reduction strategies:

<br>Reducing Access to Lethal Means
<br>Teaching Brief Problem Solving and Coping Skills
<br>Enhancing Social Support and Identifying Emergency Contacts
<br>Using Motivational Enhancement to Increase likelihood of Engagement in Further Treatment




<br>Assessing for Child Abuse on Video Session:

<br>On a video call, observe how the house appears:

<br>Look for ongoing sings that go beyond messiness. 
<br>Is perishable good sitting out after multiple calls?
<br>Is there an absence of food or do family members appear to be losing weight?
<br>Are there signs of pests or rodents?
<br>Do children appear significantly unkempt or not bathed?


<br>Look for signs of increased frustration. 
<br>This is a time of great stress for parents, ask questions to see how well a parent is coping. 

<br>"How are things going with the kids?"
<br>"What are you getting to do during the day?"


<br>Speak with the Children:

<br>Ask for time to speak with the children along. 
<br>Observe their reactions to who and what is around them. 
<br>What is their level of focus?
<br>Do they seem particularly stressed or emotional?
<br>Is their behavior atypical?


<br>Be Understanding:

<br>If a parent is expressing desperation, be empathetic. 
<br>It is normal for parents to express frustration with statements such as 'being over it' or 'giving up.'
<br>Red flags for a listener include:

<br>Over rigidity
<br>Persistent expression of negative emotions
<br>Inability to see beyond their immediate concern
<br>Extreme frustration that suggest possible escalation to physical aggression






<br>Telepresence and Virtual Professionalism:

<br>Telebehavioral health (TBH) professionals can demonstrate how to apply appropriate techniques to maximize therapeutic atmosphere in both physical and virtual environments as well as minimize distraction and interruptions. 
<br>Professionals can show how to approximate an in-person relationship and foster spontaneity through TBH. 


<br>Creating a Virtual Office:

<br>When setting up your virtual office, we must consider the following:

<br>Physical Location
<br>Privacy
<br>Lighting
<br>Comfort


<br>Where is your home based or online office located physically?

<br>Is it near a power source?
<br>Is there a way to 'close the door' to your office? (i.e., is there at least a door between your office space and other common areas in your location?)
<br>Is it a high traffic area?


<br>How can you create a distraction free environment?

<br>Turn off anything that makes noise. 
<br>A sign outside the door can help remind others not to make noise during the session. 
<br>Avoid a space with lots of clutter on the desk. 
<br>Be mindful of what is behind you in the camera's view. 


<br>How can you create a quality video image?

<br>Make sure you are well lit. 
<br>Are there shadows being cast on my face?
<br>Am I lit well enough to see me clearly?
<br>Find the best source of lighting. 

<br>Overhead light (may not be the best)
<br>Desk Lamp
<br>Single Floor Lamp (Often Good: 4-5 ft, bulbs point up to the ceiling)


<br>Make sure your camera is well placed. 

<br>Eye level with the camera straight at you (ideal).


<br>Practice good posture (use the picture-in-picture)


<br>How can you create a therapeutic environment?

<br>Find an office space with minimal distractions or a solid color background. 
<br>Be mindful of clothing to limit distractions. 

<br>Solid colors are best
<br>Avoid busy patterns
<br>Avoid large jewelry and hats






<br>Before the First Session:

<br>Provide clear instructions to your clients about how to join the session. 
<br>Become aware of common technical problems that could arise and how to trouble shoot for these problems. 
<br>If possible, host a test call. 
<br>Both therapist and client obtain contact information in case of technology failure. 


<br>During the First Session:

<br>Ask for initial feedback for sound and video quality
<br>Allow for more time for interviews
<br>Remain attentive
<br>Keep eyes on camera
<br>Avoid distracting behavior and excessive movement
<br>Turn off anything that makes noise
<br>Remain in view of camera at all times
<br>Be mindful of possible delays and lags in video
<br>Speak slowly and deliberately


<br>Understanding Telebehavioral Health Competencies:

<br>Clinical Evaluation and Care
<br>Virtual Environment and Telepresence
<br>Technology
<br>Legal &amp; Regulatory Issues
<br>Evidence-Based &amp; Ethical Practice
<br>Mobile Health Technologies Including Applications (Apps)
<br>Telepractice Development


<br>Telebehavioral Health Competency Levels:

<br>Novice:

<br>Identify and describe issues
<br>Conduct basic screening
<br>List pros and cons of using various technologies
<br>Protect security, privacy, and confidentiality
<br>Educate clients about fundamental TBH, laws, rules, regulations, ethical requirements, policies, procedures, assessments, interventions, standards and communication styles. 


<br>Proficient
<br>Authority:

<br>Demonstrate the basics of using computers, remote patient monitoring, social media and mobile health and the issues related to recommending the use of apps. 
<br>Discuss how to legally and ethically market their own services online.

 <br><br>
<br>A treatment plan refers to a written document that outlines the proposed goals, plan, and methods of therapy. 
<br><br>
<br>Diagnosis
<br>Presenting Problem
<br>Treatment Goals
<br>Treatment Objectives
<br>Treatment Strategy/Interventions
<br>Frequency and Duration of Treatment
<br>Evaluation: Measuring Progress and Outcomes
<br><br>
<br>Goals are the building blocks of the treatment plan. 
<br>They are designed to be specific, realistic, and tailored to the needs of the person in therapy. 
<br>The language should also meet the person on their level. 
<br>Treatment Goals must be SMART
<br>A SMART goal provides structure and a sense of direction that supports members in increasing their chances of achieving their treatment goal (s).

<br>Specific
<br>Measurable
<br>Achievable
<br>Relevant
<br>Time-Bound


<br><br>
<br>Goals are often broken down into objectives to support the person in therapy through the process of taking small, achievable steps toward the completion of the larger goal.
<br><br>
<br>Goals usually also include the various techniques and interventions the mental health professional will implement to support achievement of the larger goal.
<br><br>
<br>Frequency refers to how often will they attend - weekly, every two weeks, once a month, once, as needed, etc.
<br>Duration refers to how long someone will attend 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, etc. 
<br><br>
<br>Is the client achieving progress?

<br>Measured in several ways:

<br>Client self-report
<br>Therapist observation
<br>Informal and Formal Assessment




<br><br><br>
<br>Case conceptualization is a report based on information gathered, organized, and assessed to provide an explanation of client’s behavior or presenting problem.  

<br>It is the therapist perspective on the case.


<br>Theory guides our case conceptualization or our view of the problem.

<br>Family systems theory  
<br>Specific theoretical approach or model  


<br>Case Conceptualization is not a diagnosis in itself  

<br>There is a diagnostic component


<br><br>
<br>Introduction of the client
<br>Presenting concern
<br>Background information
<br>Systemic assessment
<br>Genogram
<br><br>
<br>Listen to client's story and presenting problem. 
<br>Gather information about how they understand their world
<br>Obtain demographic information
<br>Explore social, cultural, and historical context
<br>Assess client's strengths and coping skills
<br><br>
<br>Assess for risk, create a problem list
<br>Diagnose
<br>Apply theoretical orientation and hypothesize about the nature of the problem
<br>Develop goals
<br>Plan interventions
<br><br>
<br>Apply theory to information gathers in initial interview
<br>What is your theoretical understanding of the client?
<br>What patterns of thinking, feeling, and action need to be addressed?
<br>How does theory inform the treatment goals?

Clinical Writing and Documentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Clinical documentation is a tool that guides the clinical process and aids in measuring outcomes. 

<br>Client documentation provides the content required for clients' clinical chart, also known as the medical record or health record. 

<br>Medical/Health records are legal documents and are protexted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)




<br><br><br>
<br>When you meet with a client for the first time, you gather background information and outline policies and procedures for the therapy process. 
<br>An Intake Note allows you to document a full biopsychosocial evaluation of your client, including the presenting problem, a mental status exam, and history. 
<br>Is also allows you to document other important events that occur during the intake process, such as obtaining informed consent for treatment, reviewing practice policies and procedures, and discussing important topics like confidentiality and billing. 
<br><br>
<br>Limits of confidentiality
<br>Payment procedures
<br>Telehealth Procedures
<br>Contact outside of the session
<br>Risks and benefits of therapy
<br>Cancellation policies
<br>Reasons for coming to therapy
<br>Previous experiences with therapy
<br>How current problems are affecting the client
<br>Medical history
<br>Current medications
<br>Substance use history
<br>Any previous mental health diagnoses
<br>Mental health history (including hospitalizations, SI, HI)
<br>Family History
<br>Employment
<br>Trauma history
<br>Education history
<br>Cultural Background
<br>Support system
<br>Any assessments they've taken
<br>Legal history
<br>Strengths
<br>Religious/spiritual concerns
<br>Mental Status Exam
<br><br>
<br>A treatment plan refers to a written document that outlines the proposed goals, plan, and methods of therapy. 
<br>A Treatment Plan must be completed prior to completing a Progress Note for a client's first scheduled Therapy Session after their intake session. 
<br>This is because the Diagnosis, Objectives, and Frequency of Treatment are initially recorded on a client's Treatment Plan and pull forward into subsequent Progress Notes for the client. 
<br><br>
<br>Diagnosis
<br>Presenting Problem
<br>Treatment Goals
<br>Treatment Objectives
<br>Treatment Strategy/Interventions
<br>Frequency and Duration of Treatment
<br>Evaluation:

<br>Measuring Progress and Outcomes


<br><br>
<br>Progress notes, are the official record of each therapy session. They're meant to be shared with other members of the client's care team and insurers when requested. 
<br>Progress notes include information such as diagnoses, interventions used, and progress toward treatment plan goals. 
<br>SOAP Notes:
<br>Subjective:

<br>This section details the session from the client's perspective. It includes information like the client's feelings on their progress or lack of progress, the effectiveness of therapy, and goals for the session. 


<br>Objective:

<br>Next, you'll list your own observations of the client's overall demeanor, attitude toward therapy, how they responded to the interventions you used, and any results you achieved. 


<br>Assessment:

<br>In this section, you'll digest the information from the above two secions and record your professional opinion. Include data like your clinical impressions and evaluations of their progress towards treatment goals. 


<br>Plan:

<br>Here's where you'll lay out your course of action moving forward. What do you plan to address in the next session, and what interventions do you plan on using? How does your plan relate to the client's short and long-term treatment goals?


<br><br>
<br>Key Things:

<br>All clinical documentation including progress notes should be completed within 24–48 hours of the session or non-clinical event. 

<br>Failure to complete notes in a timely manner is an ethical violation. 


<br>Progress notes and other clinical records are legal documents. 

<br>They fall under several laws and protections. 


<br>Notes and other forms of documentation should be written with care.

<br>Write your notes 'as if the client is standing over your shoulder.'




<br><br>
<br>Psychotherapy notes are defined as notes recorded by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of conversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session that are separated from the rest of the individual's medical record. 
<br>Therapist may keep psychotherapy notes separate from patient's records. 
<br>Written by mental health professional to document/analyze conversations during counseling session. 
<br>The following information is not to be included in process notes:

<br>Medication
<br>Start and stop of sessions
<br>Modalities and frequency of treatment
<br>Results of clinical tests
<br>Summaries of diagnosis, functional status, treatment plan, symptoms, prognosis, and progress to date. 


<br><br>
<br>Contact notes are non-clinical notes used to document communication between a staff member and a client or a client's contact. 
<br>If you intend to charge for the communication, a Contact also creates a billing line item. 
<br><br>
<br>The termination note is a non-billable note template used to record a client's discharge from treatment. 
<br>A discharge note, also called a termination note, is a written summary held in the client's chart of what happened during the time the client was in your care. 
<br>The discharge note also includes recommendations for future mental health care needs and referrals to help the client follow through on these recommendations. 
<br>To write a discharge note we should include:

<br>Reasons for termination, including referrals to new providers
<br>Symptoms at the time of intake
<br>Initial reasons for seeking treatment
<br>Diagnosis
<br>Treatment goals, past and present
<br>Modalities and interventions used and how the client responded 
<br>Progress (or lack thereof) made during treatment


<br>Tips on Writing Clinical Documents:
<br>
<br>Client Progress Notes are Legal Documents
<br>Use the correct words (avoid jargon)
<br>Beware of acronyms and abbreviations

<br>'Muddy Middle Phase'
<br><br>
<br>Interventions are intentional behaviors or 'change strategies' introduced by the counselor to help clients implement problem management and move toward goals. 
<br><br>
<br>Self-Disclosure
<br>Normalizing
<br>Reframing
<br>Using Questions
<br>Providing Support
<br>Confronting
<br>Crisis Stabilization
<br>Psychoeducation
<br><br>
<br>Psychoeducation refers to the process of providing education and information to those seeking or receiving mental health services, such as people diagnosed with mental health conditions (or life-threatening/terminal illnesses) and their family members. 
<br>
<br>Briefing the patients about their illness
<br>Problem-solving training
<br>Communication training
<br>Self-assertiveness training
<br><br>
<br>Information about a specific diagnosis or problem. See the handouts section below for further resources.
<br>Explaining and revieing treatment options and combinations of treatments such as medication and CBT. 
<br>Explaining psychological concepts and the interventions that will be used in your specific approach to counseling or psychotherapy. 
<br>Assessing a client's psychoeducational needs to identify gaps in the client's life skills. 
<br>Value clarification to ensure your client understands what gives their life meaning. 
<br>Emotional literacy training. 
<br>Boundary clarification and boundary setting to develop and maintain healthy relationships while moving on from unhealthy situations.
<br>Conflict resolution skills to help maintain relationships.
<br>Coping with grief following relationships' breakdown, divorce, bereavement, or job loss. 
<br>Developing parenting skills. 
<br><br>
<br>Reframing involves presenting an alternative possible explanation, interpretation or perception of an experience. 
<br>This new interpretation may then facilitate positive change. 
<br>Common reframes are related to negative or blaming statements, negative behaviors of system memebers, or difficult family situations. 
<br>There are three main goals of reframing:

<br>The first is to change the meaning of the problem(s) or behaviors. 
<br>Reframes provide system members with a potentially different direction to proceed in their situation. 
<br>Successful reframes connect system members together through the creation of a joint system focus.

<br>The presenting problem is a window into the system dynamics that contribute to the problem. 
<br>Parents are your allies as well as members of the system. This gives them a unique position. 
<br>Keep in mind ages and stages. 
<br>When parents bring children to therapy, they are likely experiencing helplessness. They are tired. 
<br>Don't go it alone! Assessment and treatment often require referrals. 
<br>Allow everyone's voice to be heard. 
<br><br>
<br>The family life cycle theory was first developed around 1960. 
<br>This theory uses the term <a data-href="Family Life Cycle" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/family-life-cycle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Life Cycle</a> to describe the emotional and intellectual stages you pass through from childhood to your retirement years as a member of a family. In each stage, you face challenges in your family life that allow you to build or gain new skills.

<br>"The systematic use of a theoretical model to establish an interpersonal process wherein trained play therapists use the therapeutic powers of play to help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth and development. "
<br>Child play therapy is a way of being with the child that honors their unique developmental level and looks for ways of helping in the 'language' of the child - play. 
<br>Licensed mental health professionals therapeutically use play to help their clients, most often children ages 3 to 12 years, to better express themselves and resolve their problems.

<br>Telebehavioral health (TBH) professionals can demonstrate how to apply appropriate techniques to maximize therapeutic atmosphere in both physical and virtual environments as well as minimize distraction and interruptions. 
<br>Professionals can show how to approximate an in-person relationship and foster spontaneity through TBH. 
<br><br>
<br>When setting up your virtual office we must consider the following:

<br>Physical location
<br>Privacy
<br>Lighting
<br>Comfort


<br>Where is your home based or online office located physically?

<br>Is it near a power source?
<br>Is there a way to 'close the door' to your office? (i.e., is there at least a door between your office space and other common areas in your location?)
<br>Is it in a high traffic area?


<br>How can you create a distraction free environment?

<br>Turn off anything that makes noise
<br>A sign outside the door can help remind others not to make noise during the session
<br>Avoid a space with lots of clutter on the desk
<br>Be mindful of what is behind you in the camera's view


<br>How can you create a quality video image?

<br>Make sure you are well lit. 
<br>Are there shadows being cast on my face?
<br>Am I lit well enough to see me clearly?
<br>Find the best source of lighting. 

<br>Overhead light (may not be the best)
<br>Desk lamp
<br>Single floor lamp (often good; 4-5 ft.; bulbs point up to the ceiling)


<br>Make sure your camera is well placed. 

<br>Eye level with the camera straight at you (ideal)


<br>Practice good posture (use the picture in picture)


<br>How can you create a therapeutic environment?

<br>Find an office space with minimal distractions or a solid color background. 
<br>Be mindful of clothing to limit distractions

<br>Solid colors are best
<br>Avoid busy patterns
<br>Avoid large jewelry and hats

<br>Risk Assessment (Past and Present)
<br>Assess for Infidelity
<br>Review Individual Functioning
<br>Understanding Presenting Problem from the Individual Perspective
<br>Continue Development of Treatment Goals
<br>Reflection and Wrap-Up
<br><br>
<br>Before this session, therapist should have an initial systemic hypothesis and theory based conceptualization of the case. 
<br>During the session:

<br>Provide clients with a summary of information gathered in sessions 1-3. 

<br>If necessary, discuss new information or secrets shared in sessions 2 and 3


<br>Review and confirm treatment goals and objectives

<br>Goals and objectives must be SMART


<br>Continue assessment as needed for individuals and/or relationship
<br>Begin intervention or working phase


<br><br>
<br>WORK the treatment plan
<br>Continue to evaluate your hypothesis and conceptualization between sessions
<br>Interventions should be based on the client's presenting problem as well as your theoretical conceptualization

<br>This book focuses on students, a pragmatic approach to treatment, regard for multidisciplinary perspectives, and respect for the influence of families on clients. Chapter 1 identifies concerns that new therapists frequently have, such as building confidence in their clinical work. Chapters 2-6 follow the usual time sequence of therapy--from initial contact with clients, to comprehensive assessment, to treatment planning and intervention. Chapters 7-10 deal with specific clinical situations based on presenting problems and the nature of client families. We examine major issues and approaches for working with children and adolescents, older adults, couples, and families that are struggling with serious mental illness. Chapter 11 highlights some common obstacles all therapists encounter, and provides concrete ideas on how to get unstuck when treatment is not progressing. Chapter 12 focuses on an often overlooked part of therapy--termination. In Chapter 13, we conclude the book by looking at emerging issues within family therapy"

<br>While family therapy offers a unique and important perspective in clinical work, much of what goes on in treatment shares common assumptions with all therapies.
<br>assessing the appropriateness of a family therapy treatment for a specific problem is an essential clinical skill. It is important to be able to recognize when a problem is outside the scope of a family therapist’s practice (or skill level) and could best be treated by another mental health professional or in tandem with another healthcare professional.
<br>A growing focus on treatment teams and multidisciplinary treatment approaches means that therapists must increasingly attend to the biological component of the biopsychosocial model and learn to collaborate with other healthcare professionals.
<br><br>
<br>Beginning therapists frequently experience feelings of inadequacy and insecurity about their clinical abilities

<br>Therapists and supervisors alike need to see confidence issues from a developmental perspective


<br><br>
<br>Paradoxically, the more one learns about how to do therapy, the more one realizes how much one doesn’t know.
<br>Although the intensity of these feelings and the ways of coping will vary from therapist to therapist, every beginning therapist struggles to some degree with these feelings.
<br>This disclosure helps the beginning therapist to accept that these struggles are developmentally appropriate rather than a sign of being unsuited for the profession
<br>the therapist–client relationship is inherently therapeutic. A therapist doesn’t need to do something for clients to have a positive experience.
<br>early experiences in seeing clients often involve a steep learning curve
<br>It takes time, however, to gain enough experience so that many situations become familiar.
<br>examine if distorted cognitions or unrealistic expectations are contributing to their fears or struggles with confidence. Beginning therapists can struggle with perfectionistic tendencies or critical self-talk
<br>The only pathway to becoming an experienced therapist was to go through the learning process that he was going through
<br>Experienced clinicians indicated that after 5–7 years (or about 5,000–7,000 hours) of clinical experience, they had encountered most clinical issues or problems several times.
<br>The intense feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed that are common in the beginning generally subside after 1–3 months of seeing clients.
<br><br>
<br>Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, “self of the therapist” stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
<br>The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family.
<br><br>
<br>Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
<br>Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist’s ability to listen and attend to the client’s story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about “doing something” with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins.
<br><br>
<br>The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
<br>To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics.

<br>“I know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I’m stuck in the content.”


<br>Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
<br>Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases
<br><br>
<br>Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
<br>Therapists’ unresolved issues or “growth areas” can become impediments in therapy.
<br>The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy.
<br><br>
<br>Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
<br>One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
<br>Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary
<br><br>
<br>The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors.

<br>Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
<br>Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
<br>The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy.


<br>To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential

<br>Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
<br>Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
<br>You also need a strong social support network

<br>Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
<br>Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable




<br><br>
<br>Keep the “big picture” in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
<br>Keep the following ‘reminders’ at hand:**

<br>Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
<br>Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
<br>Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
<br>Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities.


<br><br>
<br>The first contact is about to take place, and it can easily make or break a future collaboration where healing work can be done. 
<br><br>
<br>One of the most critical points in the therapeutic experience: the period before therapy ever begins. 
<br>During this fragile period prospective clients decide if they want to risk going to therapy. 
<br>It is not uncommon for families to be at their wit's end when they finally decide to seek treatment or are referred and call for an appointment. Chances are they're worn out, fed up, and feeling hopeless. 
<br>Individual family members may differ remarked
<br><br>
<br>For therapists and clients alike, beginning therapy can elicit feelings of fear, excitement, and nervous anticipation. Each client will take you on a different journey.
<br><br><br>
<br>In the first stage, the therapist welcomes the clients to therapy. The goal of this stage is to do introductions and put the clients at ease. 
<br><br>
<br>Administrative issues are addressed in the second stage. The purpose of this stage is to ensure clients have a clear understanding of the therapy process, including confidentiality, videotaping, and fees. 
<br><br>
<br>The goal-setting phase. Here the therapist learns what the clients hope to accomplish through therapy. 
<br>The time devoted to goal setting will also depend on the number of clients being seen. Soliciting everyone’s perspective on goals within a family will generally take longer than working with an individual.

<br>Being able to establish goals for therapy is a realistic expectation. 


<br><br>
<br>
Assessment phase, which typically extends beyond the first interview.

<br>
Therapist needs to accomplish several important tasks to make the initial interview successful. 

<br>At each stage of the initial interview, you should be working on building your relationship with your clients. Important assessment information may also come out at any point in the first session, even before the therapist has begun a more formal assessment phase.


<br>
The most crucial task of therapy is to successfully join with your clients.<br>
- <a data-href="Joining" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> means that clients feel a sense of connectedness with you, which usually arises when they feel you understand, respect, and care about them. Joining is both a technique (developing rapport) and an attitude.<br>
- It is the foundation for future work. Failure to successfully join with your clients will hamper all of your efforts, from assessment to treatment.<br>
- Failure to join with clients can lead to <a data-href="Premature Termination (PT)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/premature-termination-(pt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Premature Termination (PT)</a> of therapy.<br>
- The therapist missed an opportunity to connect with the client and create a safe environment for therapy to take place.<br>
- Joining is a process that should be carefully attended to throughout the entire initial interview.<br>
- When you begin the session, you should attempt to put your clients at ease given that they are most likely anxious about coming to therapy.<br>
- Ideally, you will be able to identify something you have in common with your clients that will help develop a sense of connection.<br>
- Joining also takes place at other points throughout the initial interview.
-

Highlight<br>
Reflective listening, maintaining direct eye contact, or leaning forward can also reinforce for your clients that you are interested in them and concerned about what they are saying. Concluding the initial interview with a positive message for your clients can be another way to strengthen your connection.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Although skills to facilitate joining can be learned<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
developing a relationship with another person cannot be reduced to a recipe or set of techniques.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
who you are is the greatest asset you bring to therapy. Your personality, attitudes, life experiences, and compassion become a part of and help create the relationship.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
therapist characteristics can create a barrier to developing a connection. Therapists who have prejudices or negative preconceptions<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
about people based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or religious orientation will likely have difficulty establishing a connection with clients who have these characteristics.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you should be vigilant in assuring that personal issues or prejudices do not interfere with your developing a relationship with your clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
One of the early tasks in an initial interview is to address administrative issues so clients understand the therapy process.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
the therapist who is attuned to the process and not just the content when handling administrative issues may discover important opportunities for assessment or even intervention.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
need to be informed not only of the confidential nature of therapy, but also of the possible exceptions to confidentiality<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
It is best practice to cover confidentially both orally and in writing with your client. The consent form for treatment<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
should include what is and what is not kept confidential in therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Therapists working with couples and families must also consider how confidentiality among family members will be handled.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The therapist must address the extent to which information obtained during these individual sessions will be kept confidential or shared with other family members.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
offer clear guidelines as to the bounds of confidentiality at the beginning of therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You may want to consult with other individuals or institutions connected with particular cases, such as previous therapists, psychiatrists, physicians, teachers, lawyers, courts, or parole officers.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
need to have clients sign a release of information form,<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
to permit communication between you and the other parties.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The signatures of all participants in therapy are required for the release of information.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If others contact you about your clients, you should not even acknowledge that they are in therapy unless you have obtained the appropriate release of information.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
obtain a written release of information before discussing a case.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Therapeutic issues may arise when discussing confidentiality with clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You can tell your clients that you regularly consult with your supervisor, and that videotaping allows your supervisor to witness firsthand what happened in therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
“two heads are better than one.”<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
videotaping allows you to review what happened in previous sessions and perhaps have a new insight,<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
recording a session gives the therapist the option to replay part of the session for clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You should inform the client who will view the recordings, emphasizing that videotapes are considered confidential information.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
recordings are not kept permanently, but are regularly erased or recorded over.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Clients should be asked to sign a form giving their consent for videotaping sessions. The form should<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
outline the purpose of the videotaping, who will view the recordings, and what will happen to the recordings after therapy is completed.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Some clients may be reluctant to be videotaped.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You should carefully explore what is behind their reservations.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You should pay careful attention to clients who are insistent about not being videotaped given they are the exception rather than the rule. These clients often have sensitive information that they wish to protect or keep secret.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If therapy will include live supervision or the use of observing/ reflecting teams, discuss this with your clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
helpful to allow clients, at their request, to meet supervisors or team members who observe the sessions from behind the one-way mirror.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
It is difficult to assign a monetary value to therapy, and therapists often feel uneasy about charging fees while acting in a helping role. Therapist anxiety about fees can easily be transferred to clients and can create conflict and stress in therapy. Comfort in handling fees will increase with therapeutic experience and confidence in your ability to provide a worthwhile service.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
There is a business aspect of the therapy relationship and discussing fees should be handled in a business-like manner.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
the client is purchasing a service.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Most programs or clinicians establish a minimum fee and then work within a range.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
ou should discuss acceptable forms of payment, when the fee should be paid, and the fee for late cancellation or “no-show” appointments, if applicable.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
useful to have a written agreement that discusses the fees and policies regarding fees.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
third-party payers limit the number of sessions, or the types of presenting problems or diagnoses they will reimburse.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If a third-party payer is involved, the therapist should verify insurance coverage at the outset of therapy. Issues that need to be addressed may include provider eligibility, annual deductibles, rate of reimbursement, limitations on the number of sessions, or types of treatments covered. Usually a DSM-5 diagnosis will need to be assigned to the insured patient.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
As with other administrative issues, working out the details for payment can be part of the diagnostic process and help to clarify the family’s expectations of and responsibilities for therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Generally, free services tend not to be valued by clients. A fee, even a small one, provides some incentive to make effective use of services. Paying a fee also indicates that the therapy has value to the client.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
therapists may be required to discuss with clients their professional qualifications.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Many agencies and practitioners have clients read and sign an informed consent statement that generally includes a brief description of what therapy is, including the potential risks, such as being asked to examine painful issues.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
define clients’ expectations for what therapy will accomplish and how it will be conducted. This is essential to ensure that clients’ needs are compatible with what you, as the therapist, can or are willing to offer.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The first step in defining expectations is to ask your clients what they would like to accomplish through therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
How can I be helpful to you?” or “What are you hiring me to do?<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Clients hope that you will be able to fix these problems. Individuals will often say what they want to eliminate<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
and have a harder time articulating what they want<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If possible, encourage your clients to describe desired changes in positive language (what will be happening) rather than in negative language (what won’t be happening)<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
It is important that each family member is given the opportunity to be heard when discussing problems and goals. This will help in joining with each individual.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you may discover there is disagreement about the problem itself or who has the problem.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You don’t want to anger the person who talks excessively, but if you fail to interrupt this behavior, other family members may lose faith in your ability to lead the session.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In defining goals, a number of challenges can arise. Your clients may identify multiple problem areas, with little distinction of priorities.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you will need to obtain your clients’ perspective on the relative importance of their problems.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
“Of the issues you have presented, which is most important, and which is least important?”<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
your clients may not have a clear idea of what the problem is or what their goals for therapy are.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
may need to contract for a limited number of sessions to explore and define problem areas and goals.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Another potential problem is that clients may have unrealistically high expectations or goals.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Setting goals may be further complicated by the unstated agenda of a client, one that he or she feels is not appropriate to disclose.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Sometimes, even the clients may not be totally aware of their reasons for seeking therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Alternatively, individuals in couples or families may define goals that initially appear incompatible.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In these situations, you may need to creatively reframe the goals in such a way as to make them compatible or link them together.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Once you have a clear understanding of what your clients want or expect from therapy, you need to decide whether it is appropriate for you to take on the case.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you must assess whether the case is within your scope of practice, that is, whether the clients are expecting help for issues that would be considered appropriate for a family therapist to treat.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The scope of practice is defined for therapists by the laws that license or certify therapists in their state.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If the case falls outside your scope of practice, you will need to refer your clients to an appropriate professional.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you need to assess if the case falls within your scope of competence.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
do you have the necessary skills, training,<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
or experience to effectively treat the issues?<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If not, you need to refer the clients to another therapist who has the appropriate skills or qualifications.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you may be able to treat clients provided you take appropriate measures during treatment to gain the necessary competence.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
could do a literature review on treating this condition and seek supervision on the case.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
if you are working within an agency setting, you will need to evaluate if the services the clients are seeking fit within the agency’s scope of practice.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Some agencies specialize in addressing specific issues or problems, and may not want therapists working with clients who are seeking help for other concerns.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Seek consultation with your supervisor if these concerns arise, especially if there is any ambiguity around whether the issues fit under the agency’s scope of practice.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
there may be occasions where your clients’ needs are best met by working on other goals first before addressing the goals with which they initially present.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You will need to present a rationale to your clients as to why a particular sequence of treatment will ultimately be in their best interest.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Client goals are often defined in terms of what problems or issues need to be resolved. In contrast, therapist goals generally reflect what changes clients need to make to resolve their problems. Client goals tell the therapist where they want to go, whereas therapist goals describe how the client will get there.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Many clients not only bring in expectations about what therapy will accomplish, but also about how therapy will be done.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
helpful to assess what clients expect therapy will be like.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Whenever a client has had previous therapy, it is often beneficial to explore what the experience was like, as it can strongly shape (both positively and negatively) a client’s expectations regarding therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
What did the client find most useful? What about the process didn’t work for him or her? More specific questions will generate a clearer picture of what occurred and how you might apply it to the current therapy situation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
the therapist may need to educate clients about the therapy process<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Clients may hold expectations about therapy in a number of different areas.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You need to assess if their expectations align with what you think is realistic.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Clients can also have expectations about who will be in therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
It is also important that the therapist and client share similar views on the purpose of therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If the therapist and client are not on the same page in this regard, then problems are likely to arise.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The therapist and client will need to discuss what therapy is about and hopefully reach a mutually agreed-upon understanding.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
It is also possible that other client expectations may impede the therapeutic process.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In some instances, you may decide against continuing therapy because the expectations are too restrictive and would severely limit your ability to be effective.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Clients come to therapy with varying degrees of motivation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The initial interview is a good time to assess and perhaps begin to build motivation for therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
A logical time to assess motivation is when you are defining goals for therapy. Answers to the question “What brings you to therapy?” will differentiate motivated from unmotivated clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
some of these clients can become quite committed to therapy as they experience its benefits.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You should also inquire as to who first suggested therapy or called for the appointment. Generally this person is the most motivated for therapy. A good question to ask your clients is what led them to come<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
to therapy now, rather than sooner or later in their lives?<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Where clients are on the Stages of Change Cycle<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
may determine their motivation for change. This cycle recognizes that clients spend a great deal of time (precontemplation and contemplation stages) thinking about changing before they decide to take action and change. In addition, the cycle recognizes that maintaining changes,<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
can be challenging. Thus, addressing relapse is part of the process leading to permanent change. The therapist must match his or her interventions to where the client is in terms of their stage of change.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Motivational interviewing<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
suggests that the therapist’s job is to help the client resolve his or her ambivalence about change. Instead of using confrontation, the empathic therapist validates the client’s perspective and freedom to decide.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Pain around unmet needs often drives clients to change.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
it is important that you are clear on what the unmet needs are for your clients, and how much pain or distress they experience around these unmet needs<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You will need to figure out why the client is minimizing the problem, which will guide how you approach the situation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
it can helpful to explore with clients why others believe there is a problem and the possible negative consequences of not addressing it.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Sometimes clients will deny that a problem exists out of fear of consequences or injury to their self-image.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Therefore, building motivation for therapy will need to be done in conjunction with addressing the client’s denial<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If a mandated client refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists, you can suggest that there is at least one problem—he or she is being told to come to unwanted therapy. If your client agrees (which is typically the case), then you can explore what needs to happen so that the client is no longer required to come to therapy. This approach allows you to join with your client, while at the same time working on intermediate goals that address the problem.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Some clients may have poor motivation because they do not anticipate any benefit from therapy, believing that therapy is useless or the situation is hopeless.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Building a positive expectation that therapy can be helpful will be vital for these clients<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
For clients who lack confidence in their ability to change, you may need to highlight their strengths or help them challenge their negative self-talk. Noting exceptions to the problem might help build confidence and motivation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Using the above strategies does not guarantee client motivation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In these situations, you need to become comfortable with using the leverage for change provided by the courts.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
A common struggle that beginning therapists may face is when they are more motivated than their clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
This dynamic suggests that the therapist needs to step back, review the reasons for therapy, and once again evaluate the clients’ motivation.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
At times, clients might seem motivated “for the wrong reasons.”<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
You don’t need to agree with the clients’ motivations. Usually, it is enough that clients, for whatever reason, will face the demanding process of change.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
key issue that the beginning therapist must frequently deal with in the initial session: the issue of credibility.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In order for clients to have hope or an expectation of change, they must see the therapist and therapy as credible, or they may prematurely terminate therapy.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
assess early on if any issues of credibility need to be addressed.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
do the clients see therapy as an effective way to solve problems?<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
do the clients see you, in your role as the therapist, as being competent or credible?<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If you suspect there is a credibility problem, you should attempt to pinpoint where and why credibility is lacking.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
The more precise your understanding of why the client does not see you or the therapy as credible, the more likely your intervention will be “on target” in addressing this issue.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In cases where clients are resistant to therapy in general, you may be able to reframe the process in a way that builds its credibility.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you must work to reduce the stigma. You can compare therapy to coaching, in that even the best athletes,<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
use coaches.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
When clients question a therapist’s credibility, they usually focus on the lack of professional or life experience. Often you can redefine for the client what type of experience is needed to be helpful.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If you are concerned about your age and lack of experience, it may also be helpful to dress professionally and present in a professional manner.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you may need to directly address with your clients how you will compensate for your lack of experience with a particular problem or population.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
you might express your willingness to learn from them about their culture.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
While some clients are open to this approach, others will feel it is not their responsibility to educate the therapist about their culture.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Especially for these clients, it will be important for you to take the initiative to educate yourself through reading the literature.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
If clients still harbor doubts, a frequently effective strategy is to contract with them for a set number of sessions (perhaps three). This gives you time to demonstrate your competence.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
Nearly all clients are willing to give you this chance, provided the number of sessions is reasonable.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
In these situations, you need to identify a problem that can be quickly resolved to build credibility with your clients.<br>
-<br>
Highlight<br>
It is important that you not become defensive if your credibility is being questioned. If you can deal with your clients’ concerns in a nondefensive and respectful manner, this may actually build your credibility.<br>

 <br><br><br>
<br>As therapists, we know that reading is an integral part of our profession. 

<br>A handful profoundly defined my identity as a therapist, but many of them felt dry, academic, and utterly disconnected from reality. If anything reading those books left me feeling even more insecure about my craft. 

<br>Therapists have good intentions when they write books. But their message often becomes diluted - it becomes less about the nuances of personal development as a therapist and more about showcasing a series of their successes. 




<br>Through my social media experience, I have gathered some basic assumptions about therapists:

<br>We often graduate from school feeling woefully unprepared.
<br>We're scared we won't make any money. 
<br>We (mostly) love the work we do.
<br>We doubt ourselves constantly. 
<br>We second-guess our career choice. 
<br>We often feel unappreciated in the healthcare system. 
<br>We're tired of subpar working conditions. 
<br>We feel alone in our insecurities. 
<br>We wonder if we're helping our clients. 
<br>We have a dark sense of humor. 


<br>We deserve to feel supported and empowered in this field. But we differ from our predecessors, and we need more books to reflect those differences. 
<br>I see you. I am you. And I believe we need space for the messy and flawed and hopelessly insecure parts that can go along with doing this work. 
<br><br>
<br>Myth: Successful therapists don't feel insecure.

<br>"Your insecurities show you care. Nobody needs you to have all the answers. People need to know you care." Your insecurities show you care.
<br>Almost all therapists doubt themselves. And they should. When we're humble, we're more empathic and understanding, and we don't assume we know all the answers. Instead, we remain open to learning and growing. 


<br>Myth: Therapists are healthy and well-adjusted professionals.

<br>Paradoxically, we are attracted to pain. Likewise, while doing this work, we bring our stories, pains, and fears into each session. And through treating the problems of others, some therapists strategically avoid examining their own. 

<br>We might be experts in mental health, but our expertise doesn't fix our own problems. 




<br>Myth: Successful therapists always know what to do with their clients.

<br>Successful therapists don't always know what to do. Our clients rock our worlds, and our uncertainties reflect that. We can't always fit the hurt. It is impossible to always know the next move or intervention or phrase. 
<br>We all struggle with immense doubt. Successful therapists learn to embrace it. 


<br>Myth: Therapists give advice.

<br>Therapists help explore the barriers that lie between knowing and doing.
<br>Our job is to provide support and compassion. We support people in finding their conclusions about how they want to live their lives. We don't force them on to our preferred paths. 


<br>Myth: Therapists don't make any real money. 
<br>Myth: One credential is better than another credential.

<br>There probably is a best credential for you. Different credentials offer different levels of focus and expertise. 


<br>Myth: Most clients are ready to change.

<br>Most clients want to change other people. They also want to change their circumstances. They want to wake up into their perfect lives, but not if achieving such perfection requires work. 
<br>Clients do want to change. But many obstacles make that change incredibly challenging. 


<br>Myth: Therapists make great partners, parents, and friends. 

<br>Even when I try to model healthy communication or vulnerability, it doesn't mean others react positively. 

<br>Therapists are humans. We get upset and flustered; we act irrationally, and we don't always think clearly. And because we give so much to our clients all day, we often have little to give to the rest of the world. 




<br>Myth: Therapy must be face-to-face to be effective.

<br>American physicians performed lobotomies until 1967. Until 2010, American insurance companies could deny people healthcare coverage based on preexisting mental illness. We don't always know what we don't know. We only grow and get better with time. 
<br>Therapy will evolve, and face-to-face therapy isn't the only answer. We must be open to new ways of helping. We may not agree with such changes, but we must promote diversity and flexibility in this profession. If we don't adapt, the career we love will die. 


<br><br>
<br>Identify the Type of Insecure Therapist You Are:

<br>The Insecure Person:

<br>This therapist often:

<br>Struggles with an anxiety disorder.
<br>Requires ongoing reassurance and validation for their skills.
<br>Questions their abilities while in session constantly.
<br>Fantasizes about switching careers.
<br>Feels untethered in their sessions (they obsessively study new interventions or read new books or sign up for new training courses with the hopes of building more confidence).




<br>The Perfectionist:

<br>This therapist often:

<br>Believes they will fail at anything they try. 
<br>Avoids taking risks or trying new things due to unwavering fear of failure. 
<br>Wants to quantify abstract problems or solutions. 
<br>Obsesses over policies, procedures and rules. 
<br>Puts too much on their plate and typically overworks. 
<br>Feels frustrated when clients don't succeed in predictable patterns. 




<br>The Unresolved Life Shit Therapist:

<br>This therapist often:

<br>Struggles with remaining objective in sessions. 
<br>Experiences intense and possibly uncontrollable countertransference. 
<br>Stresses over their own mental health. 
<br>Feels unable to maintain consistent and healthy boundaries with clients. 




<br>The Straight-Up People Pleaser:

<br>This therapist often:

<br>Struggles or avoids confrontation with clients. 
<br>Feels terrified and upset by aggressive clients. 
<br>Dreads all forms of feedback. 
<br>Feels paralyzed when faced with any semblance of conflict. 
<br>Tiptoes around delicate issues in sessions or the workplace. 






<br>Can You Be All of the Above?:

<br>You are just a human, and you have weaknesses. Now you're more aware of what they are and how they impact your work and your clients. So, how do you actually deal?
<br>Get Your Own Therapy.

<br>Therapy has never been an exact science. The heart of what we do entails an abstract human element. We can have all the knowledge and skills, but we can't remove the human parts of our work. 
<br>Behind every successful therapist is another therapist supporting them. 
<br>Therapy makes us better therapists, and it also makes us better people. Therapy allows us to explore both our personal and professional lives in one space. It offers a valuable opportunity for growth, self-awareness, and healing. 
<br>We cannot fully support our clients without thoughtful insight into our own lives. Furthermore, how can we expect people to be honest and vulnerable with us if we never sit on the couch ourselves?




<br>But What If I've Already Tried Therapy, and It Didn't Work?

<br>Even when they know it's important, many therapists love to resist personal therapy, Usually, we fear exposing our vulnerabilities. Sharing weakness with another professional might reinforce our sense of incompetence. 
<br>"How do I find a therapist as a therapist?"

<br>If you want the easy answer, I don't have it. There is no easy answer. Our profession does not make us inherently unique as people, it just makes us privy to how psychotherapy works. 




<br>Learn to Accept Distraction:

<br>Ironic Process Theory:

<br>When we try to suppress a though, another part of our brain checks in to ensure we're not thinking about it. Yet, this brain activity triggers us to think about it more. 


<br>Intrusive thoughts happen all the time. Distraction is inevitable. It is how we deal with it that matters. 


<br>Learn How to Move Back to the Present Moment:

<br>Accept the thoughts instead of resisting them. 
<br>Pretend someone else is watching you. 
<br>Make it a personal mission to move away from your boredom. 

<br>Four pathways to reignite your interest:

<br>Acknowledge our distraction to the client. 

<br>When we admit to our own shortcomings, we model being human to our clients. 


<br>Pivot the conversation. 
<br>Address our emotions. 
<br>Pretend you are your client. 






<br>You don't need to master working with one population right away (or ever).

<br>Keep an open mind during your training years. Get exposure. Learn new ways of doing things. Many therapists stumble into a population or theory without seeking it out. Stay curious about what you don't know.


<br>Learn to accept unconventional and nonlinear progress. 

<br>Before we even attempt to measure progress, we must identify the obstacles that make measurements challenging. Here are some considerations:

<br>Obstacle 1: Clients lie (Both intentionally and unintentionally)

<br>“Our clients lie to us for many reasons. First, they want us to like them. Many clients fantasize about being our favorite client. They present well because they want us to feel proud and impressed by them. Often, they’ve had countless experiences related to feeling like they’ve let other people down. Their efforts to please emerge from the transference they experience toward us.”
<br>“Sometimes, clients lie because they know our positions of authority and power, particularly when it comes to mandated reporting. They avoid disclosing sensitive material related to issues like suicidal thoughts or child abuse. They worry the truth will get them into trouble.”
<br>“Clients also lie because they want to test us. Sometimes, they want to determine what we remember and what we forget. Are we really a safe person? Are we truly trustworthy? Can we actually hold the pain we promise we can hold? Most lies come from a place of hopeful truth.”
<br>The very best lies often sound like the very best truths. 


<br>Obstacle 2: Trust can take a very long time.

<br>We can't just turn on trust like it's a light switch. We have to foster it in every interaction we have with our clients. 


<br>Obstacle 3: Progress in One Area Can Reveal Flaws Somewhere Else.

<br>Improvements in one concentrated area can have the effect of improvement in other areas. 
<br>For new therapists, this reality may feel discouraging, and that's because it can be. After all, many clients come to us desperately wanting to change in their lives. 


<br>Obstacle 4: The Client's Goal Isn't Always the Best Goal.

<br>Therapists working with acute, high-risk populations (substance use disorders, eating disorders, complex trauma, psychotic disorders) see this discrepancy all the time. They know about denial and minimization and intellectualization. 
<br>As therapists, it's important that we recognize the hierarchy of treatment needs. Identifying and treating certain issues must precede others. However, a mismatch in priorities can certainly impact progress, and it can also create issues within the therapeutic relationship itself. After all, we aren't supposed to have an agenda. We are, however, supposed to keep our clients safe. At times, these issues can and will intersect. 


<br>Obstacle 5: We Rarely Receive Productive Feedback.

<br>Nobody sees us in the therapy room. Our colleagues, supervisors, or spouses can't watch us perform. 
<br>Although we discuss cases, we don't receive accurate feedback about our skills, because nobody truly knows what we're saying or doing. This lack of feedback makes measuring progress difficult. 
<br>Most clients won't provide us with direct feedback. We are not allowed to solicit testimonials. This dynamic leaves us in a vulnerable position. We rely on clients to be honest about their feelings towards us. At the same time, we must straddle the reality of knowing that most clients avoid confrontation, want to please us, and blame themselves if and when things go wrong in therapy. 


<br>Obstacle 6: Things Get Worse Before They Get Better.

<br>Therapists struggle when they watch their clients struggle. First, we care about their well-being. Additionally, we often assume that a happy client indicates that we are doing our job successfully. But we can't just measure progress by a client's level of happiness. In fact, happiness isn't always measurable or achievable. Sometimes, we must measure progress based on other factors like increased self-awareness or strengthening boundaries or changing negative behaviors. 
<br>We must remember that our clients may remain in the 'getting worse' phase even after they leave treatment. This phenomenon is common when we don't control the termination. 




<br>Remember that books don't always tell the truth. 

<br>Because even when therapists try to educate their readers and showcase their weaknesses, they inevitably brag about their brilliance. 
<br>All successful writing needs to be engaging, compelling, and crafted to appeal to a target demographic. 
<br>Talented writers may know how to write about therapy more than they know how to conduct therapy. 
<br>Just be mindful that even master therapists aren't perfect all the time. A good writer isn't always a good therapist. 


<br>Understand that you'll never be the right age. 

<br>We will never be the 'perfect age' to be therapists. No matter our ages, some clients will benefit from it, and others will have a problem with it. 
<br>We invariably hold biases about age, but we hold biases about everything. Our clients make automatic assumptions based on every detail we provide them. 
<br>And since we don't offer our clients much, they base their judgements on whatever is accessible. Regardless of the accuracy, the assumptions connect dots and illustrate a picture of who we are. Clients don't want us to be blank templates. They want to know we are human, and they will latch on to any shred of human evidence they can find from us. 

<br>My best advice is to lean into this narrative. Your age is yours. While it doesn't define you, it is a fixed part of you. 




<br>Don't forget that you are going to die. 

<br>I recommend you imagine yoruself on your deathbed. Scan through all the past and current events, people, and places in your life. Don't spend too long in the space. Then visualize yourself drifting into death, settling into the depths of the darkest night. 

<br>It's about reminding ourselves that life is incredibly short and precious. We don't need to have 'perfect therapist' etched on our headstones. 

<br>We are going to die, and life is so much more than the sum of our careers. We are all going to die. But before we do that, we need to learn how to live. 








<br><br>
<br>Know the limits of graduate school. 

<br>Graduate school teaches the foundational principles of psychotherapy. We learn the laws and ethics, and we receive bite-size samples of theory, interventions, and psychoeducation. But until we do therapy, we really have no way of knowing what therapy feels like. School teaches us the logic of the work, but only experience teaches us the emotion of it. 


<br>Understand your relationships can, will, and should evolve. 

<br>In becoming therapists, we learn about the nitty-gritty patterns of human behavior. Simultaneously, by understanding these patterns, we engage in a deep and rigorous self-analysis. We have no choice but to also look inward, to examine how we operate in the world. And while this soul-searching offers tantalizing insight, all self-awareness has the potential to be painful. 
<br>However, if you value emotional wellness and personal growth, the pain is a necessary part of the process. 


<br>Cultivate a connection with a professor or supervisor.

<br>Professors and supervisors also hold power. They can dramatically affect your sucess in terms of internships, scholarships, or long-term career options. We all benefit from having someone who can vouch for us. Ideally, this person will:

<br>Write an excellent letter of recommendation if needed. 
<br>Act as a reference when applying for internships or jobs. 
<br>Provide appropriate and helpful guidance.


<br>If you are a new therapist, start thinking about this goal immediately. Make yourself memorable. Ask questions. Attend office hours. Be active and engaged in conversation, and show up ready to work and learn. 


<br>Master time management. 

<br>Audit how you spend every working hour for one week. 
<br>Make red, yellow, and green to do lists.

<br>The reds are the most imminent and nonnegotiable tasks. They have to get done, so I prioritize them first. Yellows are important, but they are less time-sensitive and critical than the reds. I move to yellows only after I complete the red tasks. I reserve greens for last. Some days, I get to them. Most days, I don't. 


<br>Ban distractions. 

<br>We crave distraction. Although most of us complain about our procrastination habits, we forget that procrastination is also fun. 

<br>The best way for me to ban distractions is by prohibiting them during my red tasks. I also build in ten-minute breaks every thirty minutes. This permits me to work in longer chunks without completely draining my energy. 




<br>Remember that motivation is optional, but discipline is necessary. 

<br>Motivation is fickle because it's a feeling. Feelings, as we know, are fleeting. Discipline, on the other hand, is an action. We can discipline ourselves regardless of our feelings. 
<br>Many people who struggle with discipline also struggle with poor time management. That's because they wait to feel motivated to discipline themselves. Stop waiting. Start doing. 


<br>Take care of your finances.

<br>Financial insecurity impacts our personal lives. But it also creates an insidious ripple effect in our professional endeavors.
<br>Your financial health is part of your well-being, and today's stressors can become tomorrow's emergencies. If you're neglecting this part of your life, take the time to identify small changes you can make today. 




<br><br>
<br>Focus on being a growth-oriented therapist. 

<br>Training therapists should recognize they are learning, and that they don't need to know everything. They need to work hard, but they're allowed to have limitations. The goal is not having all the experience or knowledge. The goal is to have ongoing movement toward growth. This is a value that can and should continue throughout one's professional career. 

<br>Growth-Oriented Therapists:

<br>Ask difficult questions to clients (even if they feel uncomfortable and provocative).
<br>Presents mistakes, weaknesses, and concerns to their supervisor, with the intention to learn from them. They are active in supervision, and they offer practical suggestions and feedback to their colleagues. 
<br>Focus on client growth instead of client approval. They address pain and confront clients when appropriate. 
<br>Walk into the session with a sense of purpose and the mindset of practicing their skills. They feel a sense of control over the session. 
<br>Use conceptualization skills to interpret the client's overall presentation. They consider what is being said, but they also consider what might be omitted. 
<br>Understand the overall fluidity of therapy. They recognize that growth occurs mostly outside of sessions and that therapy is the catalyst for change (and not the change itself).
<br>Have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. They feel motivated to work on weaknesses and readily accept feedback in doing so. 
<br>Understand that therapy often has unknown outcomes. They conceptualize how clients might react, but they aren't tethered to this expectation. 


<br>Stagnant Therapists:

<br>Maintain surface-level conversation and often play it safe in dialogue with clients.
<br>Sugarcoat or downplay issues in sessions. They tend to focus only on what is going well. They share minimally in supervision, as they don't want to be judged by their supervisor or colleagues. 
<br>Struggle to accept hardships within the therapeutic relationship. They often hold back in confronting clients. 
<br>Walk into the session feeling scattered. They're at the mercy of whatever the client brings that day, and they often lose focus. 
<br>Lack conceptualization skills. They take client content and disclosures at face value, and they become distracted or overwhelmed by content details presented in session. 
<br>View sessions as separate entities. They judge sessions as 'good' or 'bad' based on variables like if a client made a significant breakthrough or responded well to a particular intervention. 
<br>May have insight into internal strengths and weaknesses. But, they feel paralyzed or doomed by their weaknesses and may become defensive over them.
<br>Want controllable outcomes. They either avoid conceptualization altogether or they expect themselves to know what exactly what to do. 




<br>Your training status isn't a secret. If you are a trainee, intern, or associate, you have already disclosed your status to clients. You are under supervision, and you work under someone else's license. Subsequently, nobody expects you to be an expert. But too many therapists fear making mistakes. 
<br>I understand it is challenging to discern which risks are appropriate to take. Nobody wants to cause irreversible harm to their clients. But that's why we have supervision and training. That's why we work under someone else. This is your time to experiment and grow - you'll never have such ample opportunity again. 


<br>Remember, your career is more than a calling. 

<br>We must remember that we are healthcare professionals and trained experts in treating mental illness. We spend significant money and time to cultivate our craft. At times, we save lives. Our work matters. Let's rise to that. 


<br>Accept all the anxieties.

<br>With time and experience, we gain confidence in ourselves and in our skills. Although the anxiety often feels paralyzing at first, you must trust that it eventually subsides. 
<br>I found comfort knowing everyone else felt equally terrified. 
<br>Accept that those negative thoughts will arise. Accept that they don't indicate your truth. 
<br>As therapists, we help people move through their fears in almost every session. It only makes sense that we learn this skill ourselves. 


<br>Practive letting go of controlling the room.

 <br>
<br>A 'sponge list' is a list of feelings, lessons, or other things you want to absorb from a specific time period (i.e. week, month, semester).
<br>Creating this list will get you thinking about what you want to gain, and help you make moves to get it. 
<br>Write it right alongside your to-do list to keep it front of mind. 
<br>To get started, ask yourself the following questions:

<br>What do I want to feel?

<br>Make sure to look at the emotion wheel to give an actual emotion, not intellectualize. 


<br>What can I learn from others?

<br>Learning requires checking our ego at the door and sometimes a change in perspective

<br>Consider lessons that others have to share
<br>Keep an open mind
<br>Silence the inner critic
<br>Try not to jump to conclusions
<br>Recap what you have learned




<br>What do I want to unlearn?

<br>Clear up mental space by starting to unlearn that which no longer serves you.

<br>Examples:

<br>Say you are struggling with unwelcoming thoughts - start by challenging them when they pop up.
<br>If you are trying to unlearn a way of handling a task or situation, ask yourself why you're so attached to that specific method?


<br>Examine what you want more of and what you want less of in your life moving forward.

<br>Check in with your needs to recalibrate and move forward with clear goals and action items.
<br>The process of reflection can help you further your unlearning.

<br>Ability to think and reflect - to not respond automatically to emotional pressures. 
<br>More highly differentiated individuals can experience strong emotion.

<br>Nuclear Family Emotional Process:

<br>The emotional forces in family - excessive emotional reactivity or fusion. 
<br>Problems can include:

<br>Reactive distancing between spouses. 
<br>Emotional dysfunction in one spouse.
<br>Marital conflict.
<br>Projection of the problems onto children.




<br>Family Projection Process:

<br>The process by which parents transmit their lack of differentiation to their children. 
<br>Emotional fusion in a couple leads to:

<br>Conflict, emotional distance, or reciprocal over-and-under functioning. 


<br>Spouses with unresolved family-of-origin issues create a family environment. 

<br>An intense focus on one or more children. 


<br>The child who is the object of the projection process becomes the child most attached to the parents and has the least differentiation of self. 


<br>Multigenerational Emotional Process:

<br>Defined as the family emotional process across multiple generations. 
<br>In each generation, the child most involved in the family's fusion moves toward a lower level of differentiation of self. 

<br>The last involved child moves toward a higher level of differentiation. 


<br>Couple establish new family which influences a child's ability to regulate emotionality. 
<br>Problems in the family are products of the relationships with parents.

<br>Finds intimacy extremely threatening


<br>Societal Emotional Process:

<br>Emotional process in society; influences the emotional process in families
<br>Background influence affecting all families. 
<br>Prolonged increase in social anxiety can result in gradual lowering of the functional level of differentiation in families. 


<br>Normal Family Development:

<br>Families vary along single continuum of differentiation, low to high
<br>Optimal development when:

<br>Individuals are relatively differentiated
<br>Anxiety is low
<br>Parents are in good emotional contact with their families




<br>Development of Behavior Disorders:

<br>Symptoms come when stress exceeds the system's ability to handle it. 
<br>Emotional fusion is the genesis of psychological problems. 
<br>Family symptoms reflect:

<br>Level of chronic anxiety
<br>Level of differentiation in family system


<br>Undifferentiation in family leads to marital problems in nuclear family




<br>Goals of Therapy:

<br>Not interested in solving problems. 
<br>Therapist helps client get past blame to examine their own role in the family. 
<br>Goals of therapy:

<br>Decrease anxiety, increase differentiation
<br>Help individuals gain insight into their family-of-origin patterns
<br>Examine process and structure of therapy:

<br>Modify marital system to change the family:

<br>Increase parent's ability to manage their own anxiety
<br>Help couple have less anxiety in their family-of-origin




<br>Conditions for Behavior Change:

<br>Understanding, not action, is the vehicle of cure
<br>Bowen differed from most systems therapists in believing that:

<br>Meaningful change does not require the presence of the entire family 


<br>Extended family




<br>Therapy:

<br>Assessment:

<br>Description and history of relationship context of problem.

 <br>
<br>
Bowen's concept for the process, occurring over several generations, in which poorly differentiated individuals marry equally immature partners, ultimately resulting in children suffering from severe psychological problems. (<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/research-citations/books/@nicholsfamilytherapyconcepts2019.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@nicholsFamilyTherapyConcepts2019</a>)

<br>
The concept of multigenerational transmission process describes how small differences in the levels of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> between parents and their offspring lead over many generations to marked differences in differentiation among the members of an extended family. The information creating these differences is transmitted across generations through relationships. The transmission occurs in several interconnected levels, ranging from the conscious teaching and learning of information to the automatic and unconscious programming of emotional reactions and behaviors. Relationally and genetically transmitted information interact to shape an individual's 'self.'

<br>
The combination of parents actively shaping the development of their offspring, offspring inately responding to their parents' moods, attitudes, and actions, and the long dependency period of human offspring results in people's developing levels of differentiation of self similar to their parents'. However, the relationship patterns of nuclear family emotional systems often result in at least one member of a sibling group developing a little more 'self' and another member developing a little less 'self' than the parents. 

<br>
People predictably select mates with levels of differentiation of self that match their own. Therefore, if one offspring's level of 'self' is higher than the parents' and another is lower, one offspring's marriage is more differentiated and the other's marriage is less differentiated than the parents' marriage. If each offspring then has a child who is more differentiated and a child who is less differentiated than himself, one three generational line becomes progressively more differentiated (the most differentiated child of the most differentiated offspring) and one line becomes progressively less differentiated (the least differentiated child of the least differentiated offspring). As these processes repeat over multiple generations, the differences between family lines grow increasingly marked. 

<br>
Levels of differntiation of self can affect longevity, marital stability, reproduction, health, educational accomplishments, and occupational successes. This impact of differentiation on overall life functioning explains the marked variation that typically exists in the lives of the members of a multigenerational family. 

<br>The highly differentiated people have unusually stable nuclear families and contribute much to society. 
<br>The poorly differentiated people have chaotic personal lives and depend heavily on others to sustain them. 


<br>
A key implication of the multigenerational concept is that the roots of the most severe human problems, as well as of the highest levels of human adaptation, are generations deep. The multigenerational transmission process not only programs the levels of 'self' people develop but also how people interact with others. Both types of programming affect the selection of a spouse 

<br>For example, if a family programs someone to atta

 <br>
<br>Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who specialized in schizophrenia

<br>Emphasized theory
<br>Bowen began his clinical work at the Menninger Clinic in 1946, where he studied mothers and their schizophrenic children. His major interest at the time was mother– child symbiosis, which led to his concept of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a> (autonomy and levelheadedness). From Menninger, Bowen moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he developed a program to hospitalize whole families with schizophrenic members. This project expanded the focus on mother–child symbiosis to include the role of fathers and led to the concept of <a data-href="Triangle" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle</a> s (diverting conflict between two people by involving a third).
<br>Beginning in 1955, when Bowen started bringing family members together to discuss their problems, he was struck by their <a data-href="Emotional Reactivity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/emotional-reactivity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional Reactivity</a>. Feelings overwhelmed reason. Bowen felt families’ tendency to pull him into the center of this <a data-href="Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass</a>, and he had to make a concerted effort to remain objective (Bowen, 1961). The ability to remain neutral and focus on the process, rather than content, of family discussions is what distinguishes a therapist from a participant in a family’s drama.
<br>To control the level of emotion, Bowen encouraged family members to talk to him, not to each other
<br>therapists weren’t immune to being sucked into family conflicts
<br>Whenever two people are struggling with conflict they can’t resolve, there is an automatic tendency to involve a third party

<br>Repeating what someone says to you about someone else is one way to stop triangling in its tracks


<br>Triangles spread out


<br>Bowen Family Life:

<br>In 1966 an emotional crisis in Bowen’s family led to a personal voyage of discovery that turned out to be as significant for Bowen’s theory as Freud’s self-analysis was for psychoanalysis.
<br>Bowen, the oldest of five children from a tightly knit rural family, kept his distance from his parents and the rest of his extended family. Like many of us, he mistook avoidance for emancipation.

<br>Unfinished emotional business stays with us, making us vulnerable to repeat conflicts we never worked out with our families


<br>Bowen’s most important achievement was detriangling himself from his parents, who’d been accustomed to complaining to him about each other

It aims to introduce this influential approach and a sample of developments in theory and practice since Bowen's first publications of his research and theory. This paper is the second edition of a 1999 article with the same title (Brown, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy, 20, 94 and 1999) and, 25 years later, offers new insights from the original author's ongoing research into the theory. This new edition is in collaboration with a second author and Bowen theory scholar, bringing fresh perspectives on the theory's applicability to family therapy practice. The core concepts are presented briefly, and a case example with a parent and symptomatic adolescent demonstrates how theory informs the role of the therapist and the therapeutic work. Examples of criticisms of Bowen theory are also discussed, including the misinterpretation around the idea of emotion in Bowen theory that is communicated in Gottman's training. Differentiation of self is clarified as the integration of emotion and intellect rather than privileging one over another, which affords the opportunity for individuals to avoid being governed by the invisible strings of sensitivities in relationships and instead be themselves in good emotional contact with the other person.<br><br>

<br><br>
<br>Families have resources for natural adaptation to life's challenges that are explored in therapy and are a foundational part of the family's understanding of itself and its capacity to make change. 
<br>The eight concepts of theory shape clinical work that tracks emotional processes in relationships and creates the opportunity for recovery and growth. 
<br>Important criticisms of the theory about culture and gender relevance, the dangers of neutralizing family violence and the use of emotion in therapy are discussed. 
<br>Seeing the theory applied to a case with symptoms in a child reveals the centrality of observing emotional processes.

<br><a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a> was born in 1913 in Tennessee and died in 1990. He trained as a psychiatrist and originally practiced within the psychoanalytical model. 
<br>At the Menninger Clinic in the late 1940 s, he had started to involve mothers in the investigation and treatment of schizophrenic patients. 
<br>His devotion to his psychoanalytic training was set aside by the time he moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1954. He was committed to psychiatry becoming an accepted science and found fodder for this in natural systems and evolution. 

<br>His groundbreaking research with NIMG enabled him and his research team to observe whole families in a residential treatment setting, where he began to include more family members in his research and psychotherapy with schizophrenic patients. This consolidated the shift from an individual and mother-child dyad focus to an appreciation of the dimensions of families as emotional systems. 


<br>In 1959, he moved to Georgetown University and established the Georgetown Family Center (where he was director until his death). 

<br>Here, his developing theory was extended to less severe emotional problems. 
<br>Between 1959 and 1962, he undertook detailed research into families across several generations. Rather than developing a theory about pathology, Bowen focused on what he saw as the common patterns of all 'human emotional systems.' 
<br>With such a focus on the qualitative similarities of all families, Bowen was known to say frequently, "There is a little schizophrenia in all of us."


<br>In 1966, Bowen published the first 'orderly presentation' of his developing ideas. 
<br>In 1967, he surprised a national family therapy conference by discussing his family experience rather than presenting the anticipated formal paper. 

<br>Bowen proceeded to encourage students to work on researching facts from their own multigenerational families of origin rather than undertaking individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy (a prominent training method of that time). The effort in one's own family is to better understand the individual self in the context of previous generational challenges, adaptations, and variations in family members' functioning. 


<br>The interest in evolutionary process distinguishes Bowen from other family therapy pioneers. He placed his earlier study of Freudian theory with 'a study of the rich body of facts that can be proven and validated' in evolution and the natural sciences. 

<br>Bowen writes:

<br>"I support the view that the human is as scientific as the other forms of life on the planet, that it will finally be possible to construct a total human theory from scientific facts alone." (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 360)




<br>Bowen was committed to his research and theory being embedded in science with the aim of developing a theory that accounted for the entire range of human behavior and its origins. 
<br><br>
<br>Bowen focused on mechanisms/patterns that develop in families to adapt to challenges and defuse anxiety. 

<br>Anxiety is presented as either acute, in that it is a response to an actual adverse event, or chronic, in that the stress response is sustained beyond factual threats.
<br>A key generator of anxiety in families is the alertness to either too much closeness (togetherness force) or too great a distance (separateness force) in a relationship. 

<br>"The theory postulates two opposing elemental life forces. One is built-in life growth force toward individuality and the differentiation of a separate 'self,' and the other an equally intense emotional closeness."




<br>While essential for human family survival, both forces are the source of tensions in relationships with family members, always shifting their pull for more connection or increased space and autonomy. 

<br>The degree of tension in any one family will be determined by the current levels of external stress and the sensitivities to particular themes transmitted down the generations and heightened or lowered levels of sensitivity related to levels of family emotional maturity or the degree of <a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>. 
<br>If family members do not have the capacity to think through their responses to relationship dilemmas but instead continue to react anxiously to perceived emotional demands, a state of chronic anxiety or sustained reactivity may be set in place. 


<br>Bowen defined eight interlocking concepts that make up his theory:

<br>Differentiation of self is the capacity to stay connected while also holding onto autonomous thinking and goal direction. It is twofold in that it has an intrapsychic expressing in integrating both thinking and feelings and an interpersonal component of maintaining a separate self while connected to a relationship. 

<br>Viewed as a continuum from low to high


<br>Bowen articulates that, "A person with a high level of 'differentiation of self,' or 'identity,' or 'individuality,' is one who can be emotionally close to others without emotional fusions or loss of self, or loss of identity." (Bowen, 1978, p. 109)
<br>In the same way that differentiation has both an intrapsychic and interpersonal component, fusion can be expressed either as a merging of feelings and thinking for an individual or a relational intense sensitivity to another's reactions, which leads to people giving up on their own ideas or values for the sake of the relationship going smoothly. 

<br>Varying degrees of fusion are discernible in all families. A person in a fused relationship reacts immediately (as if with a reflex, knee-jerk response) to the perceived demands of another person without being able to think through the choices or talk over relationship matters directly with the other person. Energy is invested in taking things personally (ensuring the emotional comfort of another) or in distancing oneself (ensuring one's own). The greater a family's tendency to fuse, the less flexibility it will have in adapting to stress.


<br>Bowen developed the idea of a hypothetical 'differentiation of self scale' to assist in conveying the continuum aspect of this concept. He points out that this was not designed as an instrument to assign people to particular levels. 

<br>Bowen maintains that the speculative nature of estimating a level of differentiation is compounded by factors usch as stress levels, individual differences in reactivity to different stressors and the degree of contact individuals have with their extended family. 
<br>Bowen acknowledged that an effort to increase differentiation is a lifelong process. The goal is to observe the self on the spectrum to enhance awareness and improve functioning in small steps.

<br>One example of gradual steps is the effort to establish a more neutral personal relationship with each parent. 

<br>"Achieving a person-to-person relationship with either parent is a major undertaking, but, if the differentiating person is aware that the result is highly desireable and of great potential benefit to self, [they have] a long-term assignment at which they can work constantly in their own way." (Bowen, 1978, p. 236)




<br>The scale of differentiation conveys that the theory is about a continuum of levels of functioning and not a theory that categorizes or pathologizes people. The goal is to observe self on this spectrum and increase functioning just a bit, leading to a similar lift in the functioning of the whole family.


<br><br>
<br>Bowen described triangles as the smallest stable relationship unit (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 135) because it is difficult to contain the emotional forces in a two-person relationship. 

<br>Triangling is said to occur when the inevitable discomfort in a dyad is relieved by involving a third party who either takes sides or provides a detour for anxiety.


<br>Under calm conditions, it is difficult to identify triangles, but like all mechanisms to manage anxiety, they emerge more frequently and more intensely under stress. 

<br>Triangles are linked closely with Bowen's concept of differentiation in that the greater the degree of fusion in a relationship, the more heightened the pull to preserve emotional stability by forming a triangle. 


<br>The process of conflict, distance and over- and underfunctioning also feature as part of the Triangling patterns in relationships. 

<br>This process is not dysfunction but can become problematic when a third party's involvement distracts the members of a dyad from resolving their relationship impasse. If a third party is drawn in, the focus shifts to criticizing or worrying about the new outsider, preventing the original complainants from resolving their tension. This detouring helps people steady themselves without working on growing their maturity. 


<br><br>
<br>In positing the 'nuclear family emotional system,' Bowen 'describes the patterns of emotional functioning in a family in a single generation' (Bowen 1978, p. 376)

<br>Observable patterns in families for managing the anxieties inherent in a family's undifferentiation. These patterns are repeated over the generations:

<br>Certain basic patterns between the father, mother, and children are replicas of the past generations and will be repeated in the generations to follow. (Bowen, 1978, p. 376)




<br>Fusion that both preserves harmony and generates tension is present in varying degrees in all families, who will predictably utilize the following patterns to manage levels of discomfort. These tension management mechanisms are:

<br>Couple conflict and distance
<br>Distance
<br>Symptoms/illness in a spouse (over and underfunctioning reciprocity)
<br>Projection of a problem onto one or more children


<br><br>
<br>The single-generation unit usually starts with a dyad - a couple who, according to Bowen, will be at approximately equal levels of differentiation (i.e., both have the same degree of need to be stabilized and validated through the relationship).
<br>Permission to disagree is one of the most important contracts between individuals in an intimate relationship. 

<br>In a fused relationship, partners interpret the emotional state of the other as their responsibility and the other; s stated disagreement as a personal affront to them. Conflict only becomes problematic when it is chronically sustained by emotional reactivity. (this is what we see in the clinic with couples who have been together for years and are coming in for couples therapy)

<br>A typical pattern in emotionally intense relationships is a cycle of closeness followed by conflict to create distance, which in turn is followed by the couple making up and resuming the intense closeness. This pattern is termed a 'conflictual cocoon,' (Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, p. 192) where anxiety is bound within the conflict cycle without spilling over to involve children.




<br><br>
<br>Distancing is not just inherent in patterns of marital conflict but a broader way of avoiding emotional tension that is part of triangling a child and over- and underfunctioning of spouses. It is one of the most instinctive ways humans reduce discomfort in a relationship by withdrawing emotionally or physically. 
<br>Kerr describes, "An example of emotional distancing is people being in physical proximity but avoiding emotionally charged topics. The anxiety is bound in the avoiding of such topics."
<br><br>
<br>In a fused relationship, where each partner looks to the other's qualities to fit their own learned manner of relating to significant others, a pattern of reciprocity can be set in motion that pushes each spouse's functioning to opposite extremes. 
<br>Both are equally undifferentiated in that they define themselves according to the reactions of the other. 

<br>The spouse who makes the most adjustments in the self in order to preserve relationship harmony is said by Bowen to be prone to developing symptoms. 

<br>"The one who functions for long periods in the adaptive [underfunctioning] position gradually loses the ability to function and make decisions for self. At that point, it requires no more than a moderate increase in stress to trigger the adaptive one into dysfunction." (Bowen, 1978, p. 378)

<br><br>
<br>Behavior therapists first began working with families in the 1970s. 

<br>Was limited in its approach to families because it often did not consider the complicated nature of family systems. 

<br>Based on learning theories; was aimed at parent training and couple communication. 
<br>The approach is now making changes to be more adaptive to the:

<br>Complex systems imbedded in families






<br><br><br>
<br>Classical Conditioning:

<br>Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS)

<br>Food


<br>Unconditioned Response (UCR)

<br>Salivation


<br>Conditioned Stimulus (CS)

<br>Ringing Bell




<br><br>
<br>Systematic Desensitization

<br>De-conditions anxiety through reciprocal inhibition.


<br><br>
<br>Operant Conditioning:

<br>Responses that are positively reinforced will be repeated more frequently
<br>Behaviors that are punished or ignored will be reduced or extinguished

<br><img alt="Positive and Negative Reinforcement.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/positive-and-negative-reinforcement.png">




<br><br>
<br>Developed behavioral parent training
<br><br>
<br>Behavioral approaches to couple and family therapy
<br><br>
<br>Introduced cognitive elements into behavioral therapy.

<br>Cognitive triangle:

<br>Thoughts -&gt; feelings -&gt; behaviors -&gt; thoughts




<br><br>
<br>Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
<br>Behavior problems are caused by:

<br>Dysfunctional patterns of reinforcement between parents and children.


<br>Behavior will remain resistant to change until more rewarding consequences are introduced.
<br><a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a>:

<br>People strive to maximize rewards and minimize costs in relationships. 


<br>Cognitive theorists emphasized the need for attitude changes to:

<br>Promote and maintain behavior change.


<br>Behavioral approaches are typically limited to two party relationships:

<br>Parent/child, spouses.
<br>Fail to take into account the triadic nature of relationships.


<br>Cognitive techniques became more prominent as behavior therapists realized:

<br>An exclusive focus on behavior often failed to address the complicated dynamics of couple and family interaction.


<br><br>
<br>CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
<br>CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. 
<br>CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. 
<br><br>
<br>Healthy families are those in which positive behaviors are maintained by:

<br>Appropriate consequences
<br>Negative behaviors are extinguished through the use of punishment


<br>Healthy families have high rations of benefits to costs<br>
(Philippines, there is no such thing as divorce)<br>
Healthy couples will be able to engage in:<br>
Effective communication skills, problem-solving skills, and conflict resolution.<br>
Healthy families and couples could adapt, be flexible, and change. 
<br><br>
<br>Behavioral Family Therapy:

<br>Symptoms are viewed as learned responses.
<br>For behavioral therapists, no underlying meanings of symptoms are sought. 
<br>Attention is focused on the symptoms themselves and the environmental responses that reinforce behavior.


<br>Cognitive behavioral therapists will include ideas about dysfunctional schemas:

<br>Regarding family roles and relationships that are learned in one's family-of-origin,
<br>Cognitive Distortions:

<br>Arbitrary Inference:

<br>Conclusions are drawn in the absence of supporting evidence.


<br>Selective Abstraction:

<br>Certain details are highlighted while other important information is ignored.


<br>Overgeneralization:

<br>Isolated incidents are taken as general patterns.


<br>Magnification and Minimization:

<br>The significance of events is unrealistically magnified or diminished.


<br>Personalization:

<br>Events are arbitrarily interpreted in reference to oneself.


<br>Dichotomous Thinking:

<br>Experiences are interpreted as all good or all bad. 


<br>Labeling and Mislabeling:

<br>Behavior is attributed to undesirable personality traits. 


<br>Mind Reading:

<br>This is the magical gift of knowing what other people are thinking about without the aid of verbal communication. 






<br><br>
<br>Behavior and cognitive changes in the way one behaves toward/thinks about family.
<br>Increase the rate of rewarding interactions in family relationships.
<br>Decrease the use of negative family interactions; increase positive interaction.
<br>Teach effective communication and problem-solving skills.
<br>Alter negative thought patterns; promoted or maintain ineffective family interactions. 
<br><br>
<br>Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered.
<br>Identify behavioral goals.
<br>Learn techniques to achieve these goals.
<br>Facilitate social reinforcement of change. 
<br><br><br>
<br>A hallmark of behavioral therapy.
<br>Families and couples - questionnaires and home observations are conducted.

<br>For sex therapy, clinical interviews are the main assessment tool.


<br>Treatment goals are set based on results of assessment.
<br>2-4 sessions (About 1.5-2 hours each)

<br>Main Point:

<br>To gather information as much as possible at the beginning to form treatment plan.
<br>Each person takes turn to respond. 
<br>Gather information, perspective-taking and avoid escalation.




<br>Information Gathering:

<br>Self-report questionnaires, clinical interviews, observation of interactional patterns. 


<br>Initial Conjoint Interviews (Couple):

<br>CBCT:

<br>How the couple met, what attracted them to each other, how they developed a deeper involvement, positive and negative life events, prior experiences in therapy.


<br>Initial Conjoint Interviews (Families):

<br>Inquired about the family members' current concerns and strengths of the relationship.
<br>Orients the family to the process of therapy by describing the structure and course of CBFT and the roles of therapist and family.




<br><br>
<br>Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment, and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals.
<br>Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy.
<br>Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives.

<br>Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words.


<br>Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. 
<br>Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of. 
<br>The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week.

<br>Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback


<br>The agenda of therapy is educational.

<br>Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation.


<br><br>
<br>Didactic role early on to strike a balance between directiveness and collaboration.
<br>Reviews homework assignments, models skills, coaches family members in practicing them, and fosters motivation.
<br>Balances alliances and interventions with all the family members or subsystems, so that they feel supported and remain equally invested in improving relationships. 
<br>Directive Role of the Therapist:

<br>Sets the pace of sessions so that the goals of treatment are addressed in a timely and sequential fashion. 
<br>Sets the agenda each session.
<br>Monitors the use of time.
<br>Responsible to stay on task and address the goals of session.
<br>Teaches the clients to self-monitor as well. 
<br>Maintains control of the session with confidence and credibility.
<br>Assumes multiple roles:

<br>Director, educator, facilitator, collaborator, advocate


<br>Balances the alliance and interventions with all members, so they feel supported and invested.


<br><br>
<br>Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions.
<br>Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interaction patterns with new ones, families need to rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.'
<br><br>
<br>Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints.
<br>Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement.
<br>Couples are helped to improve their communication.
<br>Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making.
<br>Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy.

<br>Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often. 


<br><br>
<br>Imagery
<br>Roleplay
<br>Coaching (to switch places, to increase their empathy for one another's feelings)
<br>Communication training:

<br>For example, engaging in an argument without attacking, 'I-statements', and Speaker/Listener exercises


<br>Problem-solving training
<br>Homework Assignments
<br>Mindfulness and Meditation
<br><br>
<br>Parents have control over the rewards and punishment of children.

<br>If parents change the contingencies of reinforcement, the child's behavior will change.


<br>Skills are taught in sequence (shaping).
<br>Help parents define the child's positive and problematic behaviors in specific observable actions.
<br>Tracking target behaviors.
<br>Reinforcing desired behavior through contingent encouragement with incentive charts.
<br>Disciplinary techniques include time out, ignoring problem behavior.
<br><br>
<br>Observe/Assess the frequency of problem behavior, what precedes it, and what reinforcement follows (Behavior Chaining)
<br>Shaping (reinforcing small steps toward change)
<br>Token economies (reward good behavior)
<br>Contingency contracting (agreements by parents to make certain changes following changes made by their child)
<br>Time out

<br>In the Satir model, these offer a clinician an efficient and effect means of conceptualizing how best to communicate and interact with the client.
<br>She describes 4 communication survival or coping stances:

<br><a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>

<br>These stances develop in childhood and reveal how a person communicates under stress, especially when they do not feel emotionally safe in intimate relationships. 
<br>They also are used by people to get around the threat of rejection. 

<br>Feeling and reacting to the threat, the individual who doesn't want to reveal weakness attempts to conceal it in the following ways:

<br><a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a> so the other person does not get mad. 
<br><a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a> so the other person will regard one as strong (if the person goes away, it will be their fault, not one's own)
<br><a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a> so that one deals with the threat as though it were harmless, and one's self-worth hides behind big words and intellectual concepts. 
<br><a data-href="Irrelevant (Distractor)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a> so one ignores the threat, behaving as though it were not there (maybe if one does this long enough, it really will go away).




<br>A person can use more than one, but typically a person uses one style predominantly. 
<br>Each stance acknowledges or minimizes three basic realities:

<br>Self
<br>Other
<br>Context


<br>With a partner or on your own, identify the survival communication stances that each member of your family of origin used when there was a loss of relational safety. What contexts or situations are most likely to trigger you to feel unsafe and revert to your survival stance? In what contexts have you learned to maintain congruent communication even when you feel threatened?

<br>Satir always assessed a person's level of self-esteem
<br>More useful to consider:

<br>Aspects of the self that a client values
<br>Aspects of which client are ashamed


<br>Research indicates that self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem. 
<br>As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses

 <br>
<br>The foundation for all other interventions, the ingredients of an interaction details the internal communication process and can be used to teach clients about internal and relational processes. 
<br>The ingredients questions are used to help people between understand their interactions with others and can be used with individuals, couples, or families. 
<br>When a client shares a troubling interaction with another, the therapists uses the following seven questions to walk the client through the 'ingredients of an interaction.'

<br>What do I HEAR and SEE?

<br>The therapist prompts clients to describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. 
<br>This is similar to ' <a data-href="videotalk" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/videotalk" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">videotalk</a> ' in <a data-href="Solution-Focused Therapy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/solution-focused-therapy/solution-focused-therapy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Solution-Focused Therapy</a>. 


<br>What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see?

<br>After obtaining a clear, behavioral description, the therapist facilitates a discussion of how the clients interpreted these behaviors. 
<br>Meanings often connect back to past experiences. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make?

<br>The therapist helps clients identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. 
<br>Therapists use 'facilitation of emotional expression' techniques. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS?

<br>The therapist asks clients about whether they can accept and tolerate the feelings. 
<br>The more congruence a person is, the more accepting they are of various feelings. 
<br>If a person is not accepting, survival stances will be triggered (e.g., congruent: "I don't like these feelings, but I know that they are natural."; incongruent: "I don't like these feelings and need my child to do what I say so that I don't have such feelings anymore.")
<br>Subsequent interventions target this level of feeling, not the emotions attached to the interpretation. 


<br>What DEFENSES do I use?

<br>When people use incongruent communication, they respond in the interaction using defense mechanisms such as projection, denial, ignoring, or one of the <a data-href="Communication Stances" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/communication-stances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Communication Stances</a>. 


<br>What RULES FOR COMMENTING do I use?

<br>Each person's family of origin and early significant others impart rules for commenting on interpersonal interactions that may limit self-worth, restrict choices, and determine what actions are 'allowed' and 'appropriate.'
<br>Most of these rules are unspoken and brought into future relationships without reflection on whether they are appropriate or useful. 
<br>These rules are transformed using 'softening techniques'


<br>What is my RESPONSE in the situation?

<br>How does the client respond behaviorally and verbally?
<br>Incongruent and problematic responses are targeted for change.

<br>
<br>What do I HEAR and SEE?

<br>Describe behaviorally what happened without adding interpretations. 
<br>Similar to the DESCRIBE in the DESC Model.


<br>What MEANINGS do I make of what I hear and see?

<br>Discuss how you interpreted the behaviors you heard and saw. 
<br>Meanings often connect back to past experience. 


<br>What FEELINGS do I have about the meanings I make?

<br>This helps identify specific feelings about the meanings and interpretations. 
<br>Similar to EXPRESS in the DESC Model


<br>What FEELINGS do I have ABOUT these FEELINGS?

<br>This asks whether you can accept or tolerate your feelings. 
<br>If a person is not accepting, communication stances will be triggered. 
<br>Similar to EXPRESS in the DESC Model


<br>What DEFENSES do I use?

<br>During communication, we may use one of the five communication stances to respond to interaction with others. Below are the four survival stances.

 <br>
<br>Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. 

<br>The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. 
<br>Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes.

<br>Sculpting helps people get in touch with their inner experience and express this experience to others in a way that bypasses the typical spoken word. 

<br>Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways:

<br>The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. 

<br>Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. 
<br>The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. 


<br>Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. 




<br>Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another.

<br>The individual is at the center, and surrounding them are the eight universal human resources: spiritual, contextual, nutritional, interactional, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and physical. (Reiter 2023)

<br><br>
<br>This has to do with your spiritual connection. This represents your relationship to your life force. How do you regard your life? Do you honor it? Do you use your spiritual connection in your daily life?
<br><br>
<br>This has to do with your context. This refers to the sights and sounds, the feel of things, the temperature, the light, the color, the quality of air, and the space where you live and work. Each of these factors has an important effect on your life. 
<br><br>
<br>This has to do with nutrition. What kind of food and drink do you put into your body?
<br><br>
<br>This shows how you interact with the people in your world. Your interaction shapes the nature of your relationships. How do you evaluate the quality of your various relationships? How do you use your power? Do you give it away and become a victim? Do you use it to become a dictator? Do you use it to develop harmony within yourself and with others, thus becoming an empowering leader? Do you use your power to nurture yourself or others, or to threaten? Do you team up with family members of others to do things together? Do you have fun, make jokes, and generally use good humor to make your life and that of others lighter and happier?

<br>Remember that humor and love are two very powerful healing forces. 


<br><br>
<br>This lets you know how you sense yourself. What is the physical condition of your sense organs? What freedoms do you give yourself to look, hear, touch, taste, and smell?
<br>Many of us were taught that we could only look at, touch, or listen to certain things. That often resulted in limiting our use of our senses. To acknowledge, honor, and fully and freely use our senses is the main way we interact with the outside world and stimulate ourselves internally. 
<br><br>
<br>This is that of your emotions, your feelings. How free are you to recognize and acknowledge them? What restrictions do you put on your feelings? How do you express them?
<br>All feelings are human. They bring texture, color, and sensitivity to life. Without feelings, we would be robots. 
<br>Your feelings about these feelings show you where your self-worth is in relation to your feelings. 
<br><br>
<br>This is the cognitive part of your brain. This lens tells you about the information you take in, the thoughts you have, and the meaning you give them. 
<br>From this cognitive and rational part, you can get answers to such questions as, "What do I understand? How do I learn new things? How do I analyze situations and solve problems?"
<br><br>
<br>This is the physical body with all its parts and systems.
<br>Find a good anatomy book in which you can see pictures of your bones, muscles, internal organs, together with all the different systems. Let yourself be awed and amazed at how wonderfully your body is engineered and what a treasure house of resources it contains. 
<br>Apply this information to your own body. Are you, its owner, meeting its needs? Are you listening to it? It will tell you when you are tired, hungry, or over-stressed, or alert you to any part of you that needs special care.

<br><img alt="Iceberg Model.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/iceberg-model.png">


<br>One of Satir's last theoretical developments and central focus of contemporary work was the six levels of experience. Satir use these to help clients transform their feelings about feelings to make lasting change. 
<br>These levels are likened to an iceberg, with the behavior the only visible layer and the other five layers unseen beneath the surface.
<br>At any moment, all six aspects are in play, but often we are not conscious of most of them. 
<br>The iceberg model is used to help individuals better understand their intrapsychic experience and for couples to understand how the levels of each person's experience resonates with the other. 
<br>Contemporary Satir practitioners help clients achieve intrapsychic congruence by identifying contradictions between these layers, such as taking actions one does not ultimately believe in. 
<br>The six layers of the iceberg:

<br>Behavior

<br>These come out in times of stress, and a person may use different stances in different relational contexts. 


<br>Feelings

<br>Present feelings that are strongly past-based, using past events to interpret the present. 
<br>Contemporary practitioners also ask about a person's feelings about their feelings, which invites clients to relate to their feelings differently. 


<br>Perceptions

<br>Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self (most people form their perceptions when very young, and they are based on a limited view of reality).


<br>Expectation

<br>A strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform (most people form their expectations when young, and they are often unrealistic and/or may not apply to a particular situation). 


<br>Yearnings

<br>Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed. 
<br>This level closely parallels the emphasis on secure attachment emotionally focused therapy. 




<br>Satir practitioners use the six levels of experience to assess the motivation behind problematic behaviors and interactions. 

<br>By understanding the yearnings as well as perceptions and expectations that fuel problematic behavior, coping, and feelings, therapists are able to help clients transform their feelings about their feelings (for example, being embarrassed about feeling angry) to more effectively meet the underlying longing for love and acceptance.

<br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom.

<br>"The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341)

These were:

<br>It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. 
<br>It is not okay to feel what you feel.
<br>It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
<br>It is not okay to ask for what you want.
<br>It is not okay to take risks.


<br>She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as:

<br>"What do you see going on between your  and your ?"
<br>"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
<br>"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
<br>"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
<br>*"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family."

<br>Privileges self and context while discounting the other. 
<br>To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. 
<br>On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.
<br>Their experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. 
<br>Assert their needs and desires while minimizing those of others.

<br>Needs to increase awareness of others' thoughts and feelings
<br>Direct confrontation often strengthens therapeutic relationship (they will find placators as weak)
<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge Self/Context

<br>Minimize other
<br>Best connect with those who blame by addressing their expectations


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Generally prefer more upfront and direct communication
<br>Increase blamers' awareness of others' feelings
<br>Learn how to communicate in ways that are respectful of others
<br>Direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship


<br><br>
<br>Therapists can best connect with those who blame through addressing their expectations. The goal often is to increase blamers' awareness of others' thoughts and feelings and help them learn how to communicate their personal perspectives in ways that are respectful of others.
<br>With these clients, direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Blamers generally prefer more upfront and direct communication than is generally tolerated in polite society.

<br>Your words are saying one thing, and the rest of you is saying something else. 
<br>Double messages come through when a person holds the following views: 

<br>I have low self-esteem (low pot) and believe I am bad because I feel that way. 
<br>I am fearful about hurting the other person’s feelings.
<br>I worry about retaliation from the other. 
<br>I fear rupture of our relationship.
<br>I do not want to impose. 
<br>I am unconscious of anything but myself and do not attach any significance to the other person or the interaction itself. 


<br>In nearly all of these instances, the person is unaware of giving double messages. 


<br>So the listener will be confronted by two messages, and the outcome of the communication will be greatly influenced by their response. In general, the possibilities are: 

<br>Pick up the words and ignore the rest
<br>Pick up the nonverbal part and ignore the words
<br>Ignore the whole message by changing the subject, leaving, or going to sleep
<br>Commenting on the double nature of the message

<br>The family life chronology is a timeline that includes the major events in an individual's or family's life. 

<br>Births and deaths
<br>Important family events (i.e., marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss)
<br>Important historical events (i.e., wars, natural disasters, economic downturns)


<br>This chronology gives both the therapist and the client a 'big picture' view of the context for the potential problem and provides clues as to what old wounds may be fueling the current problems, as well as what potential strengths and resources might exist.

The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive.
<br>Discounts self, other, and context. 
<br>Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. 
<br>People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis.
<br><br>
<br>Avoidance

<br>No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
<br>Associated with most severe pathology


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Creates significant challenge for therapist
<br>Identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality
<br>Make the therapeutic relationship a place of upmost safety; less need for distracting communication
<br>Increase client's ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others
<br>Acknowledge the demands of context


<br><br>
<br>A client with the irrelevant stance creates a unique challenge for therapists because there is no consistent grounding in self, other, or context for the therapist to use in understanding and communicating with the client. 
<br>The therapist must spend time 'floating' along with the client's distractions to identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality that the therapist can tap into. 
<br>Bodily sensations, touch, and physical activities often work best with this client stance. 
<br>As treatment progresses, the therapist works with these clients to increase their ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others and to acknowledge the demands of context. 
<br>Progress is typically slower with those who use this stance frequently.

<br>The placator talks in an ingratiating way, trying to please, apologizing, and never disagreeing, no matter what. 
<br>This is a 'yes man' who talks as though they could do nothing for themselves; they must always get someone's approval. 
<br>They may experience feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit during conflict or disagreement. 
<br>You may think of yourself as really worth nothing. 

<br>You are lucky just to be allowed to eat. You owe everybody gratitude, and you really are responsible for everything that goes wrong. 
<br>Naturally, you will agree with any criticism of you. You are grateful that anyone even talks to you, no matter what they say or how they say it. You would not think of asking anything for yourself. After all, who are you to ask? Besides, if you can just be good enough, it will come by itself. 


<br>Think of yourself as being physically down on one knee, wobbling a bit, and putting out one hand in a begging fashion. Keep your head up so your neck will hurt, your eyes will strain, and in no time at all your head will ache. 

<br>When you talk in this position, your voice 




<br>Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. 
<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge Other/Context

<br>Minimizes self (sometimes context)
<br>People-pleasing tendencies


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs
<br>Assertiveness/clear communication of needs
<br>Less directive therapy methods
<br>Multiple choice options to practice sense of agency


<br><br>
<br>Because placatory have people-pleasing tendencies, therapists use less directive therapy methods, such as multiple choice questions and open-ended reflections, to require them to voice their opinion and take a stand. 
<br>Therapists should carefully avoid giving opinions, making it seem that they have an opinion, or offering too much personal information. 

<br>Clients will use this type of information to know what parts of themselves to hide and what parts to foreground to gain therapist approval. 


<br>Research indicates that some clients make up things to give the impression that therapy is progressing. 
<br>Not until the placator regularly and openly disagrees with the therapist has rapport been established.

<br>Readiness refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>. 

<br>Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. 
<br>Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain.

<br>"There is always hope that your life can change, because you can always learn new things." (<a data-href="@satirNewPeoplemaking1988" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/literature/@satirnewpeoplemaking1988.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@satirNewPeoplemaking1988</a>)


<br>The ability to value one's self and to treat oneself with dignity, love, and reality. Anyone who is loved is open to change.
<br>The crucial factor in what happens both inside people and between people is one's self-worth.
<br><a data-href="@satirNewPeoplemaking1988" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/literature/@satirnewpeoplemaking1988.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@satirNewPeoplemaking1988</a>

<br>To build self-worth and self-esteem:

<br>Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
<br>Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late.




<br>It is more useful to consider the specific aspects of the self that a client values and the aspects of which he or she is ashamed. 
<br>More recent research on self-esteem indicates that <a data-href="Self-Compassion" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-compassion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Compassion</a> self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem, which can be artificially high. 

<br>People who overestimate their abilities and worth often have high self-esteem but significant problems in their interpersonal and work or school relationships because they have unrealistic expectations of 'what is due to them.'


<br>The best indicator of health, self-compassion is one's ability to accept strengths and weaknesses are almost always equally harsh on themselves. 

<br>Conversely, those who are hard on themselves are almost always equally harsh on others, even if it is not verbalized. 


<br>As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses while realistically assigning and assuming responsibility for their actions.

<br>Satir wrote one of the first books about family therapy, Conjoint Family Therapy, in which she provided transcripts of how she worked. 
<br>She moved to Esalen and developed the <a data-href="Avanta Network" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/avanta-network.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Avanta Network</a>, which included practitioners who operated from her model, sometimes called the human process validation movement or the Satir Growth Model. 

<br>Satir developed the Avanta Network in 1977 to help teach people how to connect with one another and achieve their full potential. 
<br>The word 'Avanta' means move forward. 


<br>She focused on the wholeness of the person and helped people move from positions of low self-esteem to become authentic and congruent.
<br>She was considered the mother of family therapy. She was interested in communication, but added an emotional dimension that helped to counterbalance the cold and calculated approach. 

<br>She realized the family therapy field lacked the connection to the emotional life of families. 


<br>Satir saw troubled family members as trapped in narrow roles that limit options and sap self-esteem. She was the humanizing force in early days of therapy where the rest of the field was focused on the systems metaphor. 
<br>She began her private practice in 1951, and by 1955, she was training therapists at the Illinois Psychiatric Institute to work with families. She then joined MRI in Palo Alto. 
<br>1962 was the year she received a grant from the NIMH that provided funding to establish the first family therapy training program.

<br><br><br>
<br>To understand the world, we can study the family: issues such as power, intimacy, autonomy, trust, and communication skills are vital parts underlying how we live in the world. To change the world is to change the family.
<br>Family life is something like an iceberg: most people are aware of only about one-tenth of what is going on - the tenth that they can see and hear. 

<br>Just as a sailor's fate depends on knowing that the bulk of the iceberg is under the water, so a family's fate depends on understanding the feelings and needs that lie beneath every family events. (What goes on under the table?)


<br>Over the years I have developed a picture of what human beings living humanly are like. They are people who understand, value, and develop their bodies, finding them beautiful and useful. They are real and honest to and about themselves and others; they are loving and kind to themselves and others. People living humanly are willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, and to change when the situation calls for it. They find ways to accommodate what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not. 
<br>The family is the context in which a person with such dimensions developers. And the adults in charge are the peoplemakers.

<br>Four aspects of family life:

<br>The feelings and ideas one has about oneself, which I call self-worth. 
<br>The ways people use to work out meaning with one another, which I call communication.
<br>The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into what I call the family system.
<br>The way people relate to other people and institutions outside the family, which I call the link to society.




<br>In all the troubled families I noticed that:

<br>Self-wroth was low
<br>Communication was indirect, vague, and not really honest
<br>Rules were indirect, nonnegotiable, and everlasting
<br>The family's link to society was fearful, placating, and blaming


<br>In all nurturing families, I consistently see a different pattern:

<br>Self-worth is high
<br>Communication is direct, clear, specific, and honest
<br>Rules are flexible, human, appropriate, and subject to change
<br>The link to society is open and hopeful, and is based on choice


<br>The changes all rest on new learnings, new awareness, and a new consciousness. Everyone can achieve these. 
<br>Families everywhere deal with the same issues. In all families...

<br>Every person communicates; the question is, 

<br>How, and what happens as a result?


<br>Every person follows rules; the question is, 

<br>What kind, and how well do they work for them?


<br>Every person is linked to society; the question is, 

<br>In what way, and what are the results?




<br>Natural Family

<br>The man and woman who sired and conceived the child continue to care for that child until the child is grown


<br>One-Parent Family

<br>One parent leaves the family by death, divorce, or desertion, and all of the parenting is done by the remaining parent


<br>Blended Family

<br>Children are parented by step-, adoptive, foster, or gay parents


<br>Institutional Family

<br>Groups of adults rear groups of children, as in institutions, communes, or extended families


<br>The same forces will be at work in all families:

<br>Self-Worth
<br>Communication
<br>Rules
<br>Links to Society


<br>People are always doing the best they can. 

<br>Developing a family is the hardest, most complicated job in the world. The very fact that you are reading this tells me that you care about yourself and the well-being of your family. 


<br>Knowing something begins a change; experiencing makes it happen.

<br>If you feel shy or doubtful about inviting family members to participate in these exercises with you, become thoroughly familiar with what you are asking, feel it from your heart, and present your wish simply and directly. 
<br>"Will you participate with me in an experiment that I think might be useful to use?"

<br>You maximize the opportunity for a positive response. 




<br>Badgering, demanding, or nagging people to go along turns the transaction into a power struggle. 

<br>(I think this may be refer to the <a data-href="Battle for Structure" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Structure</a> and the <a data-href="Battle for Initiative" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Initiative</a>)


<br>I see two kinds of pain:

<br>Pain of recognition of problems
<br>Pain of blame
<br>The first we can't avoid; the second we can. We can direct our effects to change what we can and to work out creative ways to live with what we can't change. 
<br><a data-href="Serenity Prayer" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/serenity-prayer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Serenity Prayer</a>

<br>Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.




<br><br>
<br>Does it feel good to you to live in your family right now?
<br>Do you feel you are living with friends, people you like and trust, and who like and trust you?
<br>Is it fun and exciting to be a member of your family?
<br>Family that is more or less troubled does not mean you have a bad family. It only means that people aren't very happy and have not learned ways to love and value one another openly. 
<br>Families can be placed somewhere along a scale from 'very nurturing' to 'very troubled'

<br>The atmosphere in a troubled family is easy to feel. I quickly sense discomfort. Sometimes it feels cold. Sometimes it feels as if everything were constantly spinning, like a top; I get dizzy and can't find my balance. Or it may be an atmosphere of foreboding, like the lull before a storm, when thunder may crash and lightning strike at any moment. Sometimes I feel very sad and cannot find an obvious reason. I realize that's because the sources are covered up. 

<br>I begin to understand why so many members of troubled families were beset with physical ills. Their bodies were simply reacting humanly to a very inhuman atmosphere. 

<br>Everybody has physical reactions to individuals around him or her. 
<br>The first step of change is to recognize what is happening.


<br>There is little evidence of friendship among individual family members, little joy in one another. The family seems to stay together through duty, with people just trying to tolerate one another. 
<br>More often humor is caustic, sarcastic, even cruel. 
<br>The adults are so busy telling the child and each other what to do and what not to do that they never get to enjoy themselves as persons. 
<br>In some families, people simply avoided one another. 


<br>The family can be the place where one finds love and understanding and support, even when all else fails; where we can be refreshed and recharged to cope more effectively with the world outside. 
<br>No one would intentionally pick this troubled way of living. Families accept it only because they know of no other way. 
<br>A nurturing family is where I would be listened to and would be interested in listening to others; I would be considered and would wish to consider others.

<br>I could openly show my affection as well as my pain and disapproval. 
<br>I would not be afraid to take risks because everyone in my family would realize that some mistakes are bound to come with my risk-taking - that my mistakes are a sign that I am growing. 
<br>I would feel like a person in my own right - noticed, valued, loved, and clearly asked to notice, value, and love others. 
<br>I would feel free to respond with humor and laughter when it fits. 
<br>The houses in which these people live tend to have a lot of light and color. 

<br>Clearly a place where people live, these homes are planned for their comfort and enjoyment, not as showplaces for the neighbors. 


<br>When there is quiet, it is peaceful quiet, not the stillness of fear and caution. Each person seems to know that they will have the chance to be heard. If one's turn doesn't come now, it is only because there isn't time - not because one isn't loved. 
<br>People seem comfortable about touching one another and showing their affection, regardless of age. People show their loving and caring by talking openly and listening with concern, being straight and real with one another, and simply being together. 
<br>Members of a nurturing family feel free to tell each other how they feel. Anything can be talked about. 
<br>Nurturing families can make plans. If something interferes with the plan, they can readily make adjustments, often with a sense of humor. This way they are able to handle more of life's problems without panicking. 
<br>Thus the incident would be used as a learning opportunity (which raises the child's self-worth) rather than as a cause for punishment, which puts that self-worth into question. 

<br>In the nurturing family it is easy to pick up the message that human life and human feelings are more important than anything else. 


<br>These parents see themselves as empowering leaders, not as authoritative bosses. They see their job primarily as one of teaching their children how to be truly human in all situations. 

<br>The behavior of these parents matches what they say. How different from the troubled parent who tells the children not to hurt each other, but slaps them whenever displeased. 


<br>Parents are people; they learn that good leaders are careful of their timing: they watch for an opportunity to talk to their children when they can really be heard. When a child has misbehaved, the father or mother moves physically close to offer support. This helps the offending child overcome fear and guilt feelings and make the best of the teaching the parent is about to offer. 
<br>We can help make new contacts with others and pave the way for better ways of dealing with each other. 
<br>Parents in nurturing families know that their children are not intentionally bad. 

<br>If someone behaves destructively, parents realize some misunderstanding has arisen or someone's self-esteem is dangerously low. 
<br>They know people learn only when valuing themselves and feeling valued, so they don't respond to behavior in a way that will make people feel devalued. Even when it is possible to change behavior by shaming or punishing, the resulting scar is not easily or quickly healed. 
<br>When a child must be corrected, nurturing parents rely on being clear:

<br>Asking for information, listening, touching, understanding, using careful timing, and being aware of the child's feelings and natural wishes to learn and to please. 
<br>Children learn from the modeling of direct behavior. 




<br>Parents in a nurturing family realize problems come along, simply because life offers them, and they will be alert to creative solutions as each new problem appears. 

<br>Troubled families, on the other hand, put all their energies into the hopeless attempt to keep problems from happening; when they do happen - and, of course, they always do - these people have no resources left for solving the crisis. 


<br>Nurturing parents realize change is inevitable. 

<br>They accept change as part of being alive and try to use it creatively to make their families still more nurturing. 


<br>The human heart is always seeking love. 
<br>Troubled families make troubled people and thus contribute to the devaluing of self. 

<br>Giving ourselves full permission to make the family a place to develop people who are more truly human will reflect itself in a safer and more humanly responsive world. We can make the family a real place for developing real people. Each of us is a discovery, and each of us makes a difference. 
<br>Most of the things that caused families to be troubled are learned after birth. Since they are learned, they can be unlearned, and new things can be learned in their place. 

<br>You need to recognize that your family sometimes is a troubled family. 
<br>You need for forgive yourself for past mistakes and give yourself permission to change, knowing that things can be different. 
<br>Make a decision to change things. 
<br>Take some action to start the process of change. 


<br>Whatever may have happened in the past represented the best you knew how to do at the time. 

<br>Chances are that the causes of your family pain have been invisible to all of you.

<br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is a concept, an attitude, a feeling, an image; and it is represented by behavior.
<br><br>
<br>When I was a little girl, I lived on a farm in Wisconsin. On our back porch was a huge black iron pot, which had lovely rounded sides and stood on three legs. My mother made her own soap, so for part of the year the pot was filled with soap. When threshing crews came through in the summer, we filled the pot with stew. At other times, my father used it to store manure for my mother's flower beds. We came to call it the "3-S pot." Anyone who wanted to use the pot faced two questions: What is the pot now full of, and how full is it?

<br>When people told me about themselves - whether they felt full, empty, dirty, or even 'cracked' - I thought of that old pot. 
<br>Pot is a plain word in this use, almost a nonsense word. 

<br>Families often find it easier to express themselves in pot terms and to understand when other people express themselves this way. 
<br>When I say 'pot,' I mean self-worth or self-esteem. Every person has a feeling of worth, positive or negative. As with my old family pot, the questions are:

<br>Is my self-worth negative or positive at this point, and how much of it is there?






<br><a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a> is the ability to value one's self and to treat oneself with dignity, love, and reality. Anyone who is loved is open to change. The crucial factor in what happens both inside people and between people is one's self-worth, one's pot. 

<br>Integrity, honesty, responsibility, compassion, love, and competence - all flow easily from people whose self-esteem is high. 
<br>We feel that we matter, that the world is a better place because we are here. 
<br>We have faith in our own competence. 
<br>We are able to ask others for help, yet we believe we can make our own decisions and are, in the end, our own best resources. 
<br>Appreciating our own worth, we are ready to see and respect the worth of others. We radiate trust and hope. 
<br>We don't have rules against anything we feel. We also know that we don't have to act on everything we feel. We can choose. 
<br>Our intelligence directs our actions. 
<br>We accept all of ourselves as human. 


<br>Vital people feel high-pot most of the time. 

<br>But vital people treat these temporary low-pot feelings as just what they are: a crisis of the moment. This crisis might well be the birth pains of some new possibility for us. We may feel uncomfortable at the time but do not have to hide. We know we can emerge from this crisis whole. 


<br>When people feel they have little worth, they expect to be cheated, stepped on, and depreciated by others. This opens the way to becoming a victim. 

<br>Expecting the worst, these people invite it and usually get it. To defend themselves, they hide behind a wall of distrust and sink into the terrible feeling of loneliness and isolation. 
<br>Thus separated from other people, they become apathetic, indifferent toward themselves and those around them. It is hard for them to see, hear, or think clearly, and therefore they tend to step on and depreciate others. People who feel this way build huge psychological walls behind which they hide, and then defend themselves by denying they are doing this. 


<br>Fear is a natural consequence of this distrust and isolation. Fear constricts and blinds us; it keeps us from risking new ways of solving our problems. Instead, we turn to still more self-defeating behavior. (Fear, incidentally, is always fear of some future thing)

<br>As soon as a person confronts or challenges whatever they are afraid of in the present, the fear vanishes. 


<br>When persons with constant low-pot feelings experience defeat, they often label themselves as failures. 

<br>After enough of these reactions, the self is vulnerable to drugs, alcohol, or others flights from coping. 


<br>Feeling low is not the sameas low-pot. 

<br>Low pot essentially means that when you experience undesireable feelings, you try to behave as though those feelings did not exist. 
<br>It takes a lot of high self-worth to acknowledge your low feelings. 


<br>Persons of high self-esteem can feel low. The difference is that people who are feeling low don't label themselves as worthless or pretend that their low feelings do not exist. Nor do they project their feeling on someone else. 

<br>It makes a big difference whether one condemns one's self or sees this low time as a human condition with which one needs to cope. I shall be frequently calling your attention to this process of coping. 


<br>Feeling low and not admitting it is a form of lying to yourself and others. Devaluing your feelings this way is a direct link to devaluing yourself, thus deepening the conditions of low pot. Much of what happens to us is the outcome of our attitude. Since it is attitude, we can change it. 
<br>To build your self-worth:

<br>Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
<br>We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. 


<br>An infant coming into the world must rely on experiences with people and their messages about their worth as a person. For the first five or six years, the child's self-esteem is formed almost exclusively by the family. After the child starts school, other influences come into play; the family remains important. 

<br>Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. 


<br><br>
<br>Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication).
<br>Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued?
<br>Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt. 
<br>Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere in which individual differences are appreciated, love is shown openly, mistakes are used for learning, communication is open, rules are flexible, responsibility (matching promise with delivery) is modeled and honest is practiced - the kind of atmosphere found in a nurturing family. 

<br>Children in troubled families often feel worthless, growing up as they must amid 'crooked' communication, inflexible rules, criticism of their differentness, punishment for their mistakes, and no experience in learning responsibility. Such children are highly at risk of developing destructive behavior toward themselves and/or others. Much of an individual's potential is held in abeyance when this happens. 


<br>Parents with high self-esteem are more likely to create nurturing families, and low self-worth parents to produce troubled families. The system evolves out of the architects of the family: the parents. 

<br>I do hold parents responsible for accepting the consequences of their actions and learning to do differently. This is a good first step to improving the whole family situation. 


<br>It is possible to raise anyone's <a data-href="Self-Esteem or Self-Worth" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/self-esteem-or-self-worth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Esteem or Self-Worth</a>, no matter what one's age or condition. Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late. 

<br>"There is always hope that your life can change, because you can always learn new things."
<br><a data-href="My Declaration of Self-Esteem" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/my-declaration-of-self-esteem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">My Declaration of Self-Esteem</a>


<br><br>
<br>Our body language and activities reflect our thoughts and emotions. When we appreciate and love ourselves, our energy builds. When we use this energy positively and harmoniously to make a smoothly running system within each self, it creates a strong foundation from which that self can cope creatively, realistically, and compassionately with what life presents. 

<br>"When I feel good about myself and life myself, the chances are excellent that I will be able to meet life from a position of dignity, honesty, strength, love, and reality."


<br>If a person's feeling toward themselves is one of depreciation, limitation, disgust, or any other negative attitude, the energy becomes diffused and fragmented. 

<br>The self weakens, becoming a victim defeated by life:

<br>"If I do not like myself, I devalue and punish myself. I meet life from a position of fear and impotence, creating a state in which I feel victimized and act according. I punish myself and others blindly. I become interchangeably subservient and tyrannical. I hold others responsible for my actions."


<br>A person feels they do not count, feel a constant threat of rejection, and lacks the ability to look at themselves, others, and events in perspective. This is a state of low self-esteem.
<br>A person who does not value themselves will expect someone else to be responsible for bestowing that value. This often leads to endless manipulations that usually backfire on both parties. 


<br>To avoid being against others, people have been taught to love others instead of themselves. This results in self-depreciation. The question also arises, if one does not love self, how can one know how to love others? We have plenty of evidence that loving oneself makes it possible to love others; self-worth and selfishness are not the same. 
<br>I have found that the first step toward diminishing fear is to acknowledge it openly. 

<br>Then check your perception:

<br>"Is that true?"


<br>Fear of Rejection


<br>Good human relations and appropriate and loving behavior stem from persons who have strong feelings of self-worth. 

<br>Simply stated, persons who love and value themselves are able to love and value others and treat reality appropriately. 
<br>Having a strong sense of self-worth is the way to become more fully human, to having health and happiness, gaining and maintaining satisfying relationships, and being appropriate, effective, and responsible. 


<br>When one cares for oneself, one will not do anything to injure, degrade, humiliate, or otherwise destroy oneself or another, and will not hold others responsible for one's actions. 

<br>People who care for themselves would not violate their relationships to others through violence. 


<br>Those who do not love themselves can easily become instruments of hate and destruction by unscrupulous people. 

<br>They essentially give away their power, which often leads to emotional slavery. Perpetual placating exemplifies this. 


<br>The stronger one's self-worth, the easier it is to have and maintain the courage to change one's behavior. The more one values oneself, the less one demands from others. The less one demands from others, the more one can feel trust. The more one trusts oneself and others, the more one can love. The more one loves others, the less one fears them. The more one builds with them, the more one can know them. The more one knows another, the greater is one's bond and bridge with them. Self-worth behavior will thus help end the isolation and alienation between persons, groups, and nations today.

<br>In the late 1950 s, she joined <a data-href="Don Jackson" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Don Jackson</a>, <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>, and others in developing the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>. 
<br>Satir wrote one of the first books about family therapy, Conjoint Family Therapy, in which she provided transcripts of how she worked. 


<br><br>
<br>Every person has resources available to them, but when troubled, they do not usually utilize these resources to their utmost abilities.
<br><a data-href="Self-Mandala" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/self-mandala.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Mandala</a>:

<br>The individual is at the center, and surrounding them are the eight universal human resources: spiritual, contextual, nutritional, interactional, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and physical. 
<br><img alt="Satir's Self-Mandala Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/satir's-self-mandala-diagram.png">
<br>Each part is interconnected. The less these 8 areas are given energy and time, the lower a person's self-esteem. 

<br>When people experience low self-esteem, they attempt to cope by using <a data-href="Survival Stances" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Survival Stances" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Survival Stances</a>.

<br>These stances help people temporarily deal with presumed threats and protect their self-worth. The stances help to protect us, but do not help us or other people to grow and thrive. The four survival stances are:

<br><a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>:

<br>Occurs when people discount themselves and privilege the other person and the context. Individual tends to apologize a lot, feels worthless, and may become depressed or suicidal. They tend to be quite sensitive and caring. 
<br>The placating stance discounts self and privileges the other person and the context. 


<br><a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a>:

<br>Privileges self and context while discounting the other. 
<br>To cope with low self-esteem, the person attacks another individual. 
<br>On the outside the individual seems assertive, but on the inside feel isolated and alone.
<br>Their experience leads them to sometimes feel paranoid and even potentially homicidal. 


<br><a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>:

<br>Privileges the context and discounts the self and others. 
<br>Focuses on the rules rather than on emotions and relationships. 
<br>Very data driven and people appreciate them for their intellect. 
<br>To offset their internal vulnerability, the super-reasonable person doesn't allow themselves to connect with any emotions. This can lead to a rigidness that may be displayed via obsessive-compulsive behaviors. 


<br><a data-href="Irrelevant (Distractor)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a>:

<br>Discounts self, other, and context. 
<br>Engage in distraction to avoid having to deal with their low self-esteem. 
<br>People may describe them as fun and spontaneous. However, you cannot have a serious or straightforward conversation with them. This leads to a psychological orientation of confusion and possible psychosis.










<br>The goal of Satir's therapy is to help people enhance their own and others' self-esteem. When we do so, we function from a <a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a> communication stance. This is the healthiest position we can operate from. 
<br><br>
<br>The Satir Growth Model is a strength-based approach, focusing on the existing resources that family members bring with them. 
<br>Faulty coping strategies maintain problematic interactions. 
<br>Therapy provides a safe space for people to choose alternative ways of coping. Therapy increases people's self-esteem, leading them to be able to lean into their uniqueness and provide a space for their loved ones to feel comfortable in their own uniqueness as well. 
<br>Whatever techniques the therapists uses, they are designed to help raise awareness within and between people in hopes of increasing self-esteem and self-worth so that people feel freer to be authentic. (Congruence)

<br>Self-Esteem Maintenance Kit:

<br>Detective Hat:

<br>Used when there is something new that the person wants to understand better. It helped them shift away from judging an experience to exploring it. 


<br>Medallion:

<br>Two-sided and says 'yes' on one side and 'no' on the other. It is intended to help the person recognize that they can say either word, depending on what they truly want, so they can maintain their integrity. 


<br>Wand (Empowering wand, courage stick, wishing wand):

<br>Helps people move from inaction based on fear to action based on desire. 


<br>Golden Key:

<br>Opens any door - helping the person ask questions they might not have previously, so the unsayable, and do the undoable. 


<br>Wisdom Box:

<br>Helps connect the person to the wider world and all that has come before them. 






<br>Experiential therapists are interactive in the therapy room. They try to use their whole self for contact. This includes adopting an <a data-href="I-Thou Perspective" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/I-Thou Perspective" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">I-Thou Perspective</a>, where they try to promote human-to-human interaction. 

<br>Since one of the main goals of therapy is to help the client become more congruent, it is important for the therapist to engage the client congruently. The therapist must be a real person who helps model a way of being for the client. 


<br>Experiential therapists conceptualize a few main processes:

<br>Status Quo:

<br>The family is currently in this process, and is leading to difficulties bringing them to therapy. 


<br>Foreign Element:

<br>The family's expression of the desire to change. 


<br>Chaos:

<br>The therapist's introduction of novelty into the system. 


<br>Integration:

<br>Family members put what they learn from therapy into practice. 


<br>Practice:

<br>Involves trying out these learnings.


<br>New Status Quo:<br>
- New homeostasis takes hold.<br>
<img alt="Satir's Growth Model Stages.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/in-session-diagrams/satir's-growth-model-stages.png">


<br>The therapist raises the intensity of interactions so that people encounter their own experiences and can thus become more authentic. Therapy then helps people to allow others to be more authentic. 
<br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>:

<br>Sculpting helps people get in touch with their inner experience and express this experience to others in a way that bypasses the typical spoken word. 
<br>Sculpting can be done in one of two primary ways:

<br>The client is asked to sculpt their family based on their experience of what it is like to be part of this family now. Then the therapist can sculpt the family based on their own inner picture of the family's experience. 

<br>Family members are asked to place other people in physical poses spatially located around the room and then to position themselves somewhere within. This provides the family with a new way of engaging with self and other. This allows for new meanings to come forth, where people can become more authentically themselves. 
<br>The therapist will begin with one member of the family. The choice of person will depend on the family organization, the presenting problem, and the therapeutic process. Once that person has presented their image of the family, the therapist acts as a guide for each family member, bringing forth their perceptions of this picture and what it represents about the various relationships in the family. Therapist then shifts to another family member to explore their experience, as every family member unique has their own way of seeing and being in the family. 


<br>Therapist may also end the sculpt by having family members sculpt their desired picture of the family. This sculpt shifts the energy in the room from a focus on past problems and dysfunction to a future functional and supportive arrangement of relationships. 




<br>Satir viewed people as housing energy and as able to transfer this energy through physical connections with one another. 
<br><a data-href="Family Reconstruction" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-reconstruction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Reconstruction</a>:

<br>The person whose relationship with the family is being explored and worked on. 


<br>The therapist prepares the reconstruction by talking with the star about their family history. This involves developing a <a data-href="Family Map" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-map.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Map</a>, or the primary family that can include the grandparents, a <a data-href="Family Life Chronology" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/family-life-chronology.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Life Chronology</a>, highlighting three generations of the star's family, including important dates and historical events (similar to the genogram), and the <a data-href="Wheel of Influence" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/wheel-of-influence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wheel of Influence</a>, a chart including all the people who influenced the star when they were growing up. 
<br>The therapist ('guide') begins the family reconstruction by telling the star's story; then sculpts the family of origin, the star's parents' families of origin, and the star's parents' relationship; and then resculpts the star's family of origin. 
<br>The overall goal is to increase the star's self-esteem so they are empowered to engage with themselves and others in new and more productive ways. This should engender more hope in them for their future. 


<br><a data-href="Parts Party" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/parts-party.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parts Party</a>:

<br>Based on the notion that people have many faces (or aspects of self), a parts party helps people to accept that they also have many possibilities. Some of our parts may be lying dormant, and when we access them, we increase our resources. 
<br>The parts party helps people to acknolwedge, accept, transform, and integrate their parts. 
<br>Other participants play the role of the various parts to help the person move from internal processes to more interpersonal processes. 


<br><br><br>
<br>"The Growth Model," where the focus was on helping people access their inner resources as opposed to, "The Medical Model," where the emphasis was on pathology and symptom reduction.

<br>Satir likened the role of a family therapist to that of a gardener in that people are like seeds, they carry all the resources they need for growth if nurtured and protected from blocks to their growth. She believed that the key resource for each person was their <a data-href="Unique Spirit" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/unique-spirit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unique Spirit</a> from which emanated other resources such as: self-awareness, self-acceptance, change, choice, compassion, curiosity, determination, hope, love, and wisdom. 

<br>"The question for me was never whether (people) had spirits, but how I could contact them... It was as though I saw through to the inner core of each being, seeing through to the inner core of each being, seeing the shining light of the spirit trapped in a thick black cylinder of limitation and self-rejection. My effort was to enable the person to see what I saw; then, together, we could turn the dark cylinder into a large, lighted screen and build new possibilities." (Satir, 1988, p. 340-341)


<br>Her goals for family therapy included helping the individual members increase their sense of worth and value by accessing their inner resources and by decreasing any emotional blocks. And for the family as a whole, she saw the goal as being to increase congruent communication and heart connections. 
<br>She began to observe that there were some universal unspoken rules that blocked the individual members from functioning at full capacity and also hindered the connections between members. These were:

<br>It is not okay to see what is going on in the family. 
<br>It is not okay to feel what you feel.
<br>It is not okay to talk about what you see and feel.
<br>It is not okay to ask for what you want.
<br>It is not okay to take risks.


<br>She would observe the family members and their interaction and if she detected any of these rules in the family, she would help them break them by asking questions such as:

<br>"What do you see going on between your  and your ?"
<br>"What are you aware of feeling at this moment?"
<br>"Can you tell your ___ what you are feeling?"
<br>"Can you ask your ___ for what you want?"
<br>"I invite you to use your courage and say what you see happening in your family."


<br>She also helped them to make better connections with each other by decreasing their defensiveness. Satir identified the primary defensive stances as <a data-href="Blaming (Blamer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/blaming-(blamer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming (Blamer)</a>, <a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>, <a data-href="Distracting" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Distracting" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Distracting</a>, and being <a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>.

<br>Cutting-Off (Refusing to talk to the other for days or longer.)


<br>Within a family system, these defenses can be played out in interactional patterns such as:

<br>Blame - Blame
<br>Blame - Withdraw
<br>Placate - Placate
<br>Blame - Placate
<br>Blame - Distract
<br>Withdraw - Withdraw






<br><br>
<br>Satir developed a process for helping people change and become more connected. Her process is described as having six phases:

<br>Phase 1 - Making Contact

<br>Satir would reach out using her body position, eye contact, and facial expression to make contact with each member. She would also consciously work to connect from her spirit to theirs. 


<br>Phase 2 - Validating

<br>Satir worked to help people feel validated in many ways such as reflecting their feelings, affirming their values and highlighting their inner resources. Examples include:

<br>"You feel scared because your son got suspended from school."
<br>"You value education."
<br>"You are courageous to seek help."




<br>Phase 3 - Facilitating Awareness

<br>Satir had many different ways that she would attempt to bring awareness to a family about their defensive patterns in a non-blaming way. 
<br><a data-href="Sculpting" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/interventions/sculpting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sculpting</a>:

<br>Satir placed the members in body positions to give them a picture of their defensive behavior. 

<br>For the blaming stance, she would position the person leaning toward another and pointing at them and for the placating stance, she would position the person down on one knee with their head down and their hand up in a pleading position. 




<br>Satir would also bring awareness to members by exploring their inner experiences. She used the metaphor of an iceberg to help the family therapist to conceptualize the inner level so experience driving defensive behaviors. 

<br>Above the water line were the inner levels of experience such as feelings, perceptions, expectations, beliefs, and yearnings. (What meaning are you giving to what your ___ said that is causing you to feel hurt? Is that a familiar place for you to go to when someone is disappointed in you? What is it you yearn for?)




<br>Phase 4 - Promoting Acceptance

<br>One of the ways that satir promoted acceptance was through 'normalizing,' that is, reassuring the family member that what they were experiencing was normal. ("It is normal to...")
<br>Another way that she promoted acceptance was by 'bridging' between conflicting parties. ("I am hearing that is is not easy for _, I would be interested to know how life was for you when you were their age?")


<br>Phase 5 - Eliciting Positive Choices and Changes

<br>Once Satir observed that the family members were aware of and accepting of their unhelpful patterns, she would lead them into seeing new possibilities for their interactions. 
<br>After sculpting the family, she would ask them to each to stand in a balanced way and look at each other. She would then guide them in a dialogue helping them to express themselves in non-defensives ways. Other times she would simply have them sit face to face and she would guide the dialogue between them. 
<br>"What happens for you when your  says you choose  over your ? You feel... Did you know that your  felt __? What happened for you when you heard them express their feelings? You long to be more connected with them. You miss them. How do you feel to hear how much they miss you?"


<br>Phase 6 - Reinforcing Change

<br>Satir would often combine verbal responses with some supportive touch to reinforce a positive shift. 




<br>The therapist also needs to work on their own personal growth. This is true for working with individuals but it is even more true when working with families as the chances of being triggered by your own family experience are even greater. 

<br>As Satir used to say, "You are the most important instrument in the room!"


<br><br>
<br>Under threat and reward, change is painful: change is viewed as unnatural, the unknown is feared, the status quo is maintained, life's natural 'flow' is blocked, and the familiar is valued despite discomfort. 
<br>The seed model has people viewing change more positively; as naturally occurring at a variety of levels (from cellular to cosmic) and as scary, but offering new opportunities. Discomfort is seen as a signal for change. 

<br>Therapists using the seed model keep in mind that families entering therapy are problem-focused and will maintain the status quo as a necessary survival behavior. 
<br>Therapist should make contact with each person to communicate a climate of acceptance (e.g., people do the best they can) and hear them out to discover 'what is.'
<br>Understanding the status quo stage is essential to clarify how the change process gets started or is blocked. This stage is explored further by examining resistance and readiness concepts in detail. 


<br>The coin of change has resistance and readiness as its head and tail sides. Experientially, we may want to change in one moment and fear or sabotage it in the next. Then status quo is considered a trance, accounting for change resistance as well as a medium in which change may be fostered. 
<br><br>
<br>Changing circumstances elicit shifts in perception, which in turn stimulate changes in thinking, feeling, and acting. But when circumstances shift back, behavior also reverts. 
<br>Perception can appear to create change of behavior when the meaning of an event is reframed, but the underlying pattern is not altered. Altering the underlying pattern requires dealing with resistance to change. 

<br>Resistance is a coping behavior intended to preserve the organism rather than obstruct change. Reframing resistance in terms of its positive intention. 
<br>The way we are socialized has us, "Gradually acquiring a variety of commitments which constrain the person into following a consistent pattern of behavior."

<br>The effect is to develop a lifestyle that stabilizes the events in our lives, our interdependence of meaning of these events, and the way we define ourselves, as well as predisposing us to seek consistent situations. 




<br>Experientially, change involves invoking the unfamiliar. Intellectualizing, avoiding feelings, compulsive activity, impatience about change, and dwelling in the past are all ways of dealing with the confusion by maintaining the status quo. 

<br>The tasks at this stage are to cope with the threat to past security and sense of competence and self-esteem; deal with feelings of loss and longing for the past.
<br>Conservative impulse, the will to change has to overcome an impulse to restore the past, to resist the change. Survival depends on this impulse. By stabilizing perceptions, the conservative impulse enhances the ability to learn from experience. Only when it does not fit this construct is its 'newness' experienced.


<br><a data-href="Readiness" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/readiness.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Readiness</a> refers to what Satir considered the unstable balance of elements in the <a data-href="Status Quo" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/status-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Status Quo</a>. 

<br>Persons considering change are more open to consciousness-raising interventions, more aware of themselves, more conscious of their psychic distress, and more likely to seek out information about their problem. 
<br>Variation in readiness for change (even in one person) depends on social circumstances, timing, opportunity, location, change goal, the degree of social pressure or support for the goal, alternations in environments circumstances, developmental crises, and physical or emotional pain. 


<br>Four patterns emerge reflecting the relative influence of these readiness factors. These patters are based on the degree of difficulty involved in making the change and the degree of responsibility the person is wiling to take for making the change. 

<br><a data-href="Preemptive Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Preemptive Change" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preemptive Change</a>:

<br>This pattern describes 'overnight' change. The inordinate strength of the motivating influences lowers the degree of difficulty in making the change. The degree of responsibility for the change is also low. 
<br>The change in circumstances preempts issues of loss (leaving family and friends), self-efficacy ("Can I do it?"), and self-esteem ("Am I worth the effort?") that are ordinarily addressed in making changes. Problems maintaining the change may require attention at a later point in the change process. Change literally 'happens' to us in this pattern, but we have little sense of ownership of it. 


<br><a data-href="Self-Managed Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Self-Managed Change" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Managed Change</a>:

<br>In this pattern, the influences motivating the change are less extreme or immediate than those noted in the preemptive patter. The person is influenced to take a conscious and self-responsible approach to change and is required to deal with one or more of the issues of loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in order to resolve the resistance to change.

<br><br><br><br>
<br>Five Communication Stances:

<br><a data-href="Congruent (Congruence)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/congruent-(congruence).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congruent (Congruence)</a>

<br>Able to acknowledge what you are thinking and feeling, what the other person may be thinking or feeling


<br><a data-href="Placating (Placator)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/placating-(placator).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Placating (Placator)</a>

<br>Ignore their own thoughts and feelings and focus on the thoughts and feelings of others. Quick to put aside their own emotions for the sake of others. They often are so quick to deny their own feelings. Your job as a therapist is to help them learn to acknowledge their own thoughts and feelings but also the thoughts and feelings of others. 
<br>They do not want to increase tension when needs are not met and risk having tension in the relationship. 
<br>Minimizes self
<br>People-pleasing tendencies
<br>Needs less directive therapy methods


<br><a data-href="Blamer" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Blamer" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blamer</a>

<br>Assert their needs and desires while minimizing those of others. 
<br>You will find placator and blamer married in therapy because their stances are complimentary. 
<br>Your job as a therapist is to help blamer to learn how to acknowledge and develop empathy for the thoughts and needs of others. 
<br>Minimizes other
<br>Needs to increase awareness of others' thoughts and feelings
<br>Direct confrontation often strengthens therapeutic relationship (they will find placators as weak)


<br><a data-href="Super-Reasonable (Computer)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/super-reasonable-(computer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Super-Reasonable (Computer)</a>

<br>When they are feeling threated, they revert to the context. Some logical external system. They are typically not emotional. 
<br>Minimizes self and others
<br>Logic and rules reign supreme
<br>Therapists must refer to context to gain validity
<br>Therapist should understand the logic and/or rules they use to organize their world. Therapists may need to refer to this context in order to gain validity. It is important to understand the logic of the system, but at the same time bringing in recognition and value to their own needs AND the needs and desires of others are valid. Learning how to teach them how to acknowledge all three areas of functioning. 


<br><a data-href="Irrelevant (Distractor)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/irrelevant-(distractor).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrelevant (Distractor)</a>

<br>Under distress, they distract. The class clown. When tension rises in a relationship, they distract with humor or something off-topic. They may distract. They are more likely to see this in schizophrenia. 
<br>Your job as a therapist is to get the client reengaged with the difficult topic that they would prefer to just avoid in one way or another. 
<br>Minimizes self, others, and context.
<br>No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
<br>Must increase ability to recognize thoughts and feelings of self and others.
<br>The focus for the therapist is on creating safety. Help them learn to recognize, and not be afraid of their thoughts and the thoughts of others. 




<br>Stances acknowledge or minimize three realities:

<br>Self
<br>Other
<br>Context


<br>When we feel unsafe, we revert back to one of these communication stances. These are the stances used when someone is frightened. When we don't feel safe as children, we evolve communication stances to survive when we do not feel safe when we are young. 
<br>You can use the communication stances to help better understand how to intervene, or how to communicate with your client. 

<br>When you are working with a placator, be cautious if you are going to be making a suggestion it may help to give options. "Which do you think is the best fit or might work for you?" Ask them to give voice to their thoughts and opinions because they will be very quick even to please the therapist. Their task us to learn to assert themselves in a healthy way, how can they assert their needs so that they don't become resentful, depressed (needs do not get taken care of because they are not advocating for themselves)


<br><br><br>
<br>Therapy involves going through stages several times.
<br><br><br>
<br>Can be a new way of looking at the interactions and how to communicate in a more congruent way. 
<br><br>
<br>The family is having to deal with this foreign element, this new way of interacting, this new idea, or new beliefs, this learning to tolerate direct emotional expression, etc. 
<br>That disrupts the family's <a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>
<br><br>
<br>Eventually the family integrates the new foreign element.
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>People naturally tend toward positive growth
<br>All people possess the resources for positive growth
<br>Everything impacts and is impacted by everything else. 
<br>Therapy is a process involving interaction between therapist and client; each person is responsible for themselves.
<br><br>
<br>Therapeutic presence (warmth and humanity)
<br>Making contact

<br>Making emotional contact. About real contact with the person at an intimate level. Contacting them in a very intimate, authentic, engaged way. 


<br>Empathy
<br>Conveying hope
<br>Establishing credibility

<br>You must instill the hope to clients you can be helpful for them. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Emotional Role of Symptom

<br>Symptom has a role in the family system  

<br>Example:

<br>Child's exaggerated acting out may serve to reduce tension in marriage by getting parents on the same page. 




<br>If the therapist can understand how symptom makes emotional sense, it will be easier to help find ways to interact successfully. 


<br><br>
<br>Problematic family dynamics typically involve:

<br>Power struggles
<br>Parental conflicts
<br>Lack of validation
<br>Lack of intimacy


<br><br>
<br>Each person's role in family is assessed to understand the function of the problem. 
<br>Possible roles:

<br>Martyr
<br>Victim or helpless one
<br>Rescuer
<br>Good child/parent
<br>Bad child/parent


<br><br>
<br>Timeline that includes major events in individual's or family's life. 

<br>Births and deaths
<br>Important family events:

<br>Marriages, moves, tragedies, major illnesses, job loss


<br>Important historical events:

<br>Wars, natural disasters, economic downturns




<br>Gives both the therapist and client insight into the context of the problem as well as strengths and resources might exist. 
<br><br>
<br>Child, mother, and father and quality of relationship between them. 
<br>In this primary triad a child learns how to be human. 
<br>The triad should serve as nurturing system for child. 

<br>When the child is experiencing difficulty, the therapist considers how the nurturing function of these relationships can be improved. 


<br><br>
<br>Layers of the iceberg:

<br>Behavior (Top Layer)
<br>Coping (Above)
<br>Feelings (Below) that are related to coping
<br>Perceptions, how is the person perceiving their life or how do they make meaning?
<br>Expectations, what are the expectations that are fueling all of this
<br>Yearnings (what are the primal yearnings)


<br>Helps clients transform their feelings about feelings to make change. 
<br>Helps clients observe and evaluate themselves. 
<br><br>
<br>Considers aspects of the self that the client values and aspects of which they are ashamed
<br>Self-Compassion:

<br>Better indicator of happiness than self-esteem


<br>As self-compassion and self-worth rise,

<br>Become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses. 


<br>What extent does the client value themselves?
<br><br>
<br>How emotional issues may be manifesting in the body, either symbolically or functionally
<br>The way the body is used indicates a person's communication stance:

<br>Hyper and distracted




<br><br><br>
<br>The goal is transformation  

<br>Achieve optimal realization of a person's full potential  


<br>Two sets of practical goals for treatment planning:

<br>Relationally-focused goals:

<br>Congruent communication


<br>Individual-focused goals:

<br>Self-actualization




<br><br><br>
<br>Therapist's self

<br>The way the therapist is in the room. 


<br>Ingredients of an interaction

<br>Whenever the therapist is talking with clients about difficult situations and interactions with others, they ask a series of questions. Go back to the iceberg. What do I hear and see? What is happening at the behavioral level without any interpretation. What are the meanings I make of this? What are they saying? What feelings do I have about these meanings I am making? What feelings do I have about those feelings? What defenses do I use/am I using? How does this trigger me and what kind of defensive behaviors might I bring, that makes them …. ?
<br>What are the rules within the system about how to comment about what's going on? What is allowed and what is appropriate? How am I responding and what part do I play in the system?


<br>Facilitating emotional expression

<br>What is allowed and what is appropriate? What is my response and what am I doing in this situation?
<br>Congruent expression, without the communication stances, turn chairs to each other directly, hold hands, make eye contact


<br>Softening family rules

<br>When families have rigid rules about who can say what, when, where, and how, she will soften some of these to create more space for everyone's particular way of communicating in a comfortable way to hopefully reduce the use of communication stances. 


<br>Communication enhancement

<br>Helping each member of the family learn to communicate congruently in stressful circumstances, even when they do feel threatened by their partner or their child, 
<br>Rather than reverting to a survival stance, to help them learn how to be fully congruent and present and to have more effective communications. 


<br>Sculpting or spatial metaphor

<br>She would position each person in the family to metaphorically represent their role. (Example: A placator may be sculpted as being on their knees and begging, the blamer may be there pointing their finger angrily at someone, the irrelevant type might be in a strange position far off from everybody else, the super-reasonable might be sitting there in a very cold, distant, "I am citing the rulebook")
<br>Because it is more visual than verbal - you can add a verbal element to it by having each person say a motto of theirs (eg., "Please be nice to me," "Do what I say," "Follow the rules,") - that represents their position in the family. It can push past the survival stances, intellectual defenses, the family could sculpt themselves.
<br>It can be a powerful intervention. 


<br>Touch

<br>One can use more than one stance, but usually use one style predominantly. 
<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge Other/Context

<br>Minimizes self (sometimes context)
<br>People-pleasing tendencies


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Acknowledge own thoughts, feelings, needs
<br>Assertiveness/clear communication of needs
<br>Less directive therapy methods
<br>Multiple choice options to practice sense of agency


<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge Self/Context

<br>Minimize other
<br>Best connect with those who blame by addressing their expectations


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Generally prefer more upfront and direct communication
<br>Increase blamers' awareness of others' feelings
<br>Learn how to communicate in ways that are respectful of others
<br>Direct confrontation often strengthens the therapeutic relationship


<br><br>
<br>Acknowledge context

<br>Minimizes feelings/needs of self and others
<br>Prioritize a system of 'logic' (could be rational logic, religion doctrine, etc.)


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Reference and respect system of logic
<br>Help clients to also consider internal, subjective realities of self and others
<br>Might engage by starting with their bodily reactions, expectations, practical realities


<br><br>
<br>Avoidance

<br>No consistent grounding in self, other, or context
<br>Associated with most severe pathology


<br>Therapeutic Implications:

<br>Creates significant challenge for therapist
<br>Identify the unique 'anchors' of the client's reality
<br>Make the therapeutic relationship a place of upmost safety; less need for distracting communication
<br>Increase client's ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of self and others
<br>Acknowledge the demands of context

<br><br>
<br>Satir's way of being in the world

<br>Unshakable hope and deep-felt respect for her clients


<br>Satir's presence in the room

<br>Put people at ease and allowed them to feel secure enough to relate to one another non-defensively


<br>This quality of being, or therapeutic presence, is difficult to define

<br>Few methods for systematically developing it


<br>More that therapists are congruent, the better they can create therapeutic warmth and humanity
<br><br>
<br>Satir et al., (1991) describe establishing a therapeutic relationship as 'making contact'
<br>Making Contact:

<br>Begins with the therapist being in contact with themselves, including all resources of the self in the self-mandala. 


<br>Therapist works to make contact with each client in the room, engaging them on 'all channels':

<br>Mind
<br>Body
<br>Spirit


<br>Once the therapist has made contact with each person, the therapist works to help family members make contact with each other. 
<br><br>
<br>Convey their understanding of clients' subjective, inner realities by expressing empathy
<br>Having empathy does NOT mean that a therapist:

<br>Takes the client's side
<br>Avoids confronting inconsistencies
<br>Ignores the client's responsibility


<br>Honoring the client's unique experience without validating it

<br>Makes it easier to move the client toward seeing that the other person has their unique experience, which is 'true' for that person


<br><br>

<br>Feelings

<br>Present feelings that are strongly past based
<br>Using past events to interpret the present


<br>Perceptions

<br>Beliefs, attitudes, and values that inform one's sense of self


<br>Expectations

<br>Strong belief about how life should go, how people should behave, and how one should perform


<br>Yearnings

<br>Universal longings to be loved, accepted, validated, and confirmed


<br><br>
<br>Satir always assessed a person's level of self-esteem
<br>More useful to consider:

<br>Aspects of the self that a client values
<br>Aspects of which client are ashamed


<br>Research indicates that self-compassion, or acceptance of one's strengths and weaknesses, is a better indicator of happiness than self-esteem. 
<br>As self-compassion and self-worth rise, people become more realistic and tolerant of their own and others' weaknesses
<br><br>
<br>Mind-Body Connection

<br>How emotional issues may manifest in the body, either symbolically or functionally


<br>Also assess the role of nutrition and exercise

<br>Example:

<br>If a person is feeling burdened, this emotional feeling may manifest symbolically as stooped shoulders. 




<br>Satir maintained that the way the body is used indicates the person's communication stance

<br><br>
<br>Goal of Satir's model is transformation

<br>To achieve the optimal realization of a person's full potential
<br>Attention to individual goals reflects their humanistic foundations


<br>2 broad sets of practical goals for treatment planning:

<br>Systemic/family goals
<br>Individual goals


<br><br>
<br>Relational Goal:

<br>Congruent communication

<br>Communicating authentically while responding to the needs of self and others




<br>Goal to help the family develop ways for members to communicate so the system's homeostasis does not need the symptoms
<br><br>
<br>Overarching individual goal is consistent with other humanistic approaches:

<br>To promote self-actualization


<br>Self-Actualization:

<br>Fulfilling one's potential and living an authentic and meaningful life. 


<br>Specific Goal Example:

<br>Increase sense of self-worth and self-compassion
<br>Reduce defensiveness and use of survival stances


<br><br><br>
<br>Therapists' use of self

<br>Being authentically who they are is one of the most essential interventions in Satir's approach
<br>Creates a safe relationship in which clients can practice communicating congruently


<br><br>
<br>Ingredients of an interaction:

<br>Details the internal communication process
<br>Teaches clients about internal and relational processes


<br>Ingredient Questions:

<br>Used to help people better understand their interactions with others
<br>Can be used with individuals, couples, or families


<br>Walk the client through the ingredients of an interaction:

<br>What do I hear and see?
<br>What meanings do I make of what I hear and see?
<br>What feelings do I have about the meanings I make?
<br>What feelings do I have about these feelings?
<br>What defenses do I use?
<br>What rules for commenting do I use?
<br>What is my response to the situation?


<br><br>
<br>Facilitating Emotional Expression

<br>Help put difficult emotions into words
<br>Naming emotions
<br>Locating in body
<br>Metaphor


<br>Coaching clients in how to have congruent communication in session

<br>May involve the 'ingredients of an interaction' with specific coaching strategies


<br><br>
<br>Satir's most distinctive intervention
<br>Done either with the family or in a group setting
<br>Puts family members in physical positions that represent how the 'sculptor' sees each person's role in the family
<br>Bypassing Denial/Resistance:

<br>Sculpting is a highly effective nonverbal confrontation that bypasses cognitive defenses


<br><br>
<br>Satir used touch in therapy to:

<br>Connect with clients
<br>Encourage and reassure clients when they were practicing new ways of communicating


<br>In today's environment:

<br>Touching less common because it can easily be misinterpreted as harassment


<br>Carefully consider trauma history, culture, gender, legal/ethical issues of using touch
<br>Coaching clients to touch each other
<br><br>
<br>Experiential therapies can be challenging online. 

<br>Require attending to emotions and affect, which are communicated non-verbally


<br>Requires

<br>Using more verbal communication to make up for the loss of non-verbal communication
<br>Adapting non-verbal communication
<br>Sculpting:

<br>With drawings
<br>View whole




<br><br>
<br>Experiential approaches value:

<br>Clear, congruent, emotional expression
<br>Willingness to be vulnerable


<br>Cautions

<br>Cultural
<br>Gender
<br>Social Class/Educational
<br>Norms for emotional expression vary tremendously


<br>May initially be too threatening for clients hwo have been mandated to receive treatment.

<br>Cross-Theoretical Comparison

<br>Compare how experiential therapies utilize interpersonal patterns (IPs) with other approaches described in this book. 


<br><br>
<br>Integrating systemic theory with humanism, experiential family therapists are noted for their warmth and direct emotional engagement with clients. These approaches include:

<br>The Satir Model
<br><a data-href="Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/emotionally-focused-therapy-(eft)/emotionally-focused-therapy-(eft).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)</a>

<br><br><br>
<br>Whereas systemic, strategic, structural, and cognitive-behavioral family therapists primarily track behavior interaction sequences, experiential family therapists focus more on the affective or emotional layer of those same interactions - while still attending to behavior and cognitions. 
<br>Assessment and interventions target the emotional exchanges between family members and significant others in relation to the presenting problem. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiential family therapists use warmth and empathy in building relationships with clients. 
<br>Therapists use themselves - their personhood - to make this strong affective connection with clients. 
<br>This approach creates a sense of safety that allows clients to explore areas of emotional vulnerability. 
<br><br>
<br>Experiential family therapies affress individual and family concerns as distinct sets of problems. 
<br>In contrast, systemic, structural, and integenerational therapies conceptualize individual systems as part of the family system. They assume that individual symptoms will resolve if the family system is treated.

<br>Making Contact

<br>When are you able to make authentic contact as Satir describes? Describe relationships in which you feel most authentic and able to fully connect with another. Why does this connection matter? What helps you to 'make contact' with others? (<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/research-citations/books/@gehartmasteringcompetenciesfamily2017.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017</a>)


<br>Communication Stances

<br>With a partner or on your own, identify the survival communication stances that each member of your family of origin used when there was a loss of relational safety. What contexts or situations are most likely to trigger you to feel unsafe and revert to your survival stance? In what contexts have you learned to maintain congruent communication even when you feel threatened? (<a data-href="Research Citations/Books/@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/research-citations/books/@gehartmasteringcompetenciesfamily2017.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Research Citations/Books/@gehartMasteringCompetenciesFamily2017</a>)

<br>With a partner or on your own, identify a recent stressful event that made you feel strong negative emotion of some kind. Use the iceberg to describe the multiple layers of experience related to the one event. Are some levels incongruent with other layers? Does identifying the different layers of experience help you understand the situation differently? Do you see any new options?

<br>Relax for a moment now. Close your eyes and feel your condition now. How are you feeling about yourself? What has happened or is happening at the moment? How are you responding to what is happening? How are you feeling about how you are responding? If you are feeling tight, give yourself a message of love, physically relax yourself and consciously be in touch with your breathing. Now open your eyes. You will feel stronger as a result.
<br>Since the feeling of low worth has been learned, it can be unlearned, and something new learned in its place. The possibility for this learning lasts from birth to death, so it is never too late.




<br>Other

<br>Stop reading for a few minutes and think about some families you know that would fit the description “troubled.” Did the family you grew up in have some of these characteristics: Was your family at times cold, deadening, super polite, secretive, confusing? What are the characteristics of the family you are living in now? Can you discover any signs of trouble that you haven’t been aware of before?
<br>Can you think of a family that you would call nurturing at least part of the time? Can you remember a time recently when your family could be described as nurturing? Try to remember how it felt to be in your family then. Do these times happen often?
<br>Invite your family members to try the following experiment with you. Take a partner, then tell one another your feelings ("Right now, I feel scared/tight/embarrassed/happy/etc."). Each partner simply thanks the other without judging or commenting. You thus hear one another's feelings so you can know each other better. We need a lot of practice to break the taboo against sharing our feelings. Practice as much as you can with people you trust. Now, tell each other what makes you each feel low, or high. You may find new dimensions to the people you have been living with all these years and feel closer or more real to them as a result. When you have finished the exercise, give yourself permission to share what happened for you.
<br>Tonight, when the family has settled around the table for dinner, notice what is happening to your feelings about yourself when other members speak to you. There will be some remarks to which you have no special response. However, you may be surprised to find that even "Pass the potatoes, please" can give you a feeling of or depreciation, depending on the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, timing (did the message interrupt you, or ignore something you said?), and how good you are feeling about yourself. If you are feeling good about yourself, you may find that you have a lot of options for how you respond. If you are feeling low, however, you might find that your options are limited (see chapter 6 on communication). Halfway through dinner, change the perspective. Listen to what you are saying to others. Try to be in the other's shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were talked to as you are doing now. Would you, for instance, feel loved and valued?

<br>Tomorrow night explain this little game to the other members of the family and invite them to join you. It will be helpful to read this chapter aloud before you do this as a family. After dinner, talk together about what you discovered and how you felt.


<br>Take a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon. The topic is “What new has been happening to me lately?” Everyone has a chance to share, not just the children. Leadership can rotate among the members.

<br>Don’t forget the celebration party afterward. You will probably find these times can be very enjoyable. You might try creating a funny or romantic theme, for instance.

 <br>
<br>Attempts to free people from perceived restraints so they can be whole and fully functional. 
<br><a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a>, developer of the model, sometimes called it a 'therapy for the absurd.'

<br>He believed people limited themselves based on not accepting their full selves. 
<br>He was opposed to theory. He believed if a theory became regimented, so did the therapist. This would be problematic because the therapist would be unable to be fully present and spontaneous, which is the goal for both family therapists and clients. The more people can allow themselves to be spontaneous, the more authentic they will likely be. 


<br><a data-href="Absurdity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Absurdity" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Absurdity</a>:

<br>Happens when people realize what they have been thinking is not as fearful or destructive as they originally imagined. 


<br><br>
<br>Families tend to have problems because they are engaging in rigid and repetitive ways of interacting. People have developed limiting roles. Operating only from this one role, people don't access all aspects for self. However, people are not usually aware they are operating from such a limiting role. Further, they are not connected to their emotions and how they suppress them. 

<br>This restriction of experiencing was considered crazy. 

<br>Craziness:

<br>Can be viewed in two ways:

<br><a data-href="Negative Craziness" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/negative-craziness.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Negative Craziness</a>:

<br>Happens when people restrict themselves to a rigid way of believing and doing. Negative craziness leads people to continue behaving in ways that are not working without being able to see new possibilities. 


<br><a data-href="Positive Craziness" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/positive-craziness.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Craziness</a>:

<br>Occurs when people don't restrict themselves to rigid roles and rules. Rather, they can be spontaneous and allow themselves to experience the full possibilities of their being. This type of craziness leads to growth. 










<br>Symptoms happen in families when members develop expectations of themselves and others that are limiting. They've learned how to be with one another using fused or rigid boundaries. When there are fused boundaries, members become overly dependent on one another. They then are unable to assert their individuality. With rigid boundaries, members feel isolated from one another. Each extreme boundary limits people's expectation of self and others, where they are unable to access the full range of their experience. 

<br>These extreme boundaries get pushed further away from the center when the family experience some type of stress. Some stress comes from outside the system, stress also happens when the family moved to a different development stage. 

<br>Families may also have intergenerational stress. In these situations, family members tighten up and try to become even more rigid in how they view themselves and others, as this is how they think they can better handle their problems. When they do so, they restrict the possible alternatives that could help the family to grow. 




<br><br>
<br>The goal of symbolic-experiential family therapy is about growth rather than symptom remission. Symptoms are a result of restrictions. When the family grows through the development of autonomy in its members, individual symptoms are likekly to recede. 

<br>Therapy attempts to enrich people's lives, pushing them to experience happiness, sadness, anger, jealousy, joy, and the full range of all human emotions. Therapy is not about education but rather about experiencing, helping people to move beyond arbitrarily placed limits on what they can think, say, or do. 


<br>The therapist is considered a 'coach' but not a player on the team. They will challenge people to examine the interdynamics happening in the family, but family members always have free choice in what they do.<br>
- Whitaker discussed two types of battles that happen in therapy:<br>
- <a data-href="Battle for Structure" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Structure</a>:<br>
- There is a determination of what therapy will look like. In this battle, the therapist must win. Families come to therapy and try to recapitulate their interactional process, incorporating the therapist into it. It is exactly this process that is maintaining the problem and that needs to be altered. If the therapist capitulated to the family's demands, they would be reinforcing the dysfunctional family process.<br>
- From the start of therapy, the therapist needs to send the message that something different will happen.<br>
- <a data-href="Battle for Initiative" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/whitaker/key-terms-and-concepts/battle-for-initiative.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle for Initiative</a>:<br>
- There is a determination of what family members will do in their lives. This battle needs to be won by the family. Symbolic-experiential family therapists do not try to tell family members what to do or how to live their lives. If they do so, they would be discouraging family members from being authentic. The family must take the initiative in how they want their life to go, with the family members actively supporting this push.<br>
<img alt="Battle for Structure and Initiative Diagram.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/battle-for-structure-and-initiative-diagram.png">
<br>Symbolic-experiential family therapy attempts to shake up the family. The therapist increases the anxiety in the therapy room, so that the family's normal ways of dealing with stress do not relieve it. They will then need to develop new ways of being with one another. 
<br>The therapist has an unlimited amount of tools available to them. Anything can be used if it serves the purpose of helping people be more authentic. 
<br>One of the hallmarks of this model is the use of a co-therapy team. The co-therapists are there to help augment each other. While one person is engaged with the family, the other can sit back and get a wider view of the family process. They can then put this information back into the conversation to try to stir up the family. 

<br>Having a co-therapist can model for the family how to engage one another productively, even if at times they disagree with one another.

 <br>
<br>Listen 'deconstructively' to family stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings.
<br>Ask families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning.
<br>We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
<br>And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'?

<br>The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem.
<br>Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people.
<br>As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families. 
<br>If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them.

<br>What would you call that something?


<br>What 'feeds' the problem?
<br>What 'starves' the problem?
<br>In what settings might the problem be useful?
<br>Who advocates for the problem?
<br>What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
<br>What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships?

 <br><br><br>
<br>Modernism vs. Postmodernism:

<br>Postmodernism was a response in many ways to modernism and, hence, they can be considered to be two aspects of the same movement. But there are major differences between modernism and postmodernism. 
<br>Two central tenets of the Enlightenment (beginning of the 'modern' period) were as follows:

<br>The perfectibility of human nature
<br>The belief in human progress through the development of human knowledge, especially the sciences. 


<br>In the 20
<br>th century, scientific findings, like quantum physics, seriously undermined the possibility of a deterministic model of the world. As a guiding principle, reason was still affirmed as was the belief in human progress. 

<br>The project of modernism was to examine the impediments still holding society back. 


<br>Individuals ceased to believe that art and literary works bore one unique meaning; rather, postmodernists believed in deriving their own meanings from works of art and literature.
<br>Modernism:

<br>It was an emancipatory project whose main idea was that traditional values and institutions were oppressive, divisive and inefficient and should, therefore, be replaced by rational values and institutions. 
<br>Modernism led to progress in many spheres of life by changing the approach of mankind towards culture. 

<br>Ultimately, modernism attempted to free humanity from its historical baggage through the use of philosophy and science. 




<br>Postmodernism:

<br>Postmodernism was a reaction to modernism and was influenced by disenchantment brought on by the second world war. 
<br>Postmodernism refers to the state that lacks a central hierarchy and one that is complex, ambiguous, and diverse. 
<br>Postmodernists are the nihilists.
<br>Postmodernists like Heidegger, Derrida, and Lyotard attacked the modernist belief in rationality, objectivity and universalism in favor of relativism (the view that there is no objective truth) as well as identity.
<br>Grand narratives like freedom, societal progress, scientific progress were criticized by postmodernists, who instead emphasized that difference, rather than forced unity, should be celebrated. 
<br>Postmodernism is a backlash against modernity. 

<br>The collapse of tradition created a frightening situation whereby meaning became difficult to discern amid the horror of societal breakdown. 


<br>Postmodernism, hence, represented a loss in faith in human reason. Postmodernism provides a bleak prognosis of the human condition and offers no real solutions. 




<br>Conclusion:<br>
- Modernism and postmodernism were both movements that emerged from an analysis of events within the modern period from the perspective of the values of the Enlightenment.<br>
<a data-href="Postmodernism" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/postmodernism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Postmodernism</a>:
<br><br>
<br>Theory that knowledge of things are not real unless we give them meaning.
<br>The sense of self is a social construct. Our identity is created by interactions with other people and our reactions to society.

<br>Two threads:

<br>Weak (Social Constructionism):

<br>Proposes that social constructs are dependent on brute facts (most basic and fundamental facts and do not rely on other facts).
<br>Institutional facts are created by social conventions and rely on other facts. 


<br>Strong (Social):

<br>The whole of reality is dependent on social habits. All knowledge is a social construct and there are no brute facts. 
<br>It would say we created the idea of something and how to explain it. 






<br>Main criticism:

<br>Does not take into consideration the effect of natural phenomenon that goes on in society. 


<br>Social constructionism only explains reality through the thoughts of humans, not by using fundamental brute facts.

<br><br>
<br>Knowledge is constructed. 
<br>Therapy is concerned with the ways people interpret their behavior rather than how they behave.
<br>Experience is understood in interpretation and meaning making. 
<br>Experiences can have multiple interpretations. 
<br>The Narrative Metaphor:

<br>Focuses on self-defeating cognitions - the stories people tell themselves about their problems. 


<br>\Problems affect people. 
<br>Problems operate on people rather than problems being things people are doing. 
<br>For clients to maintain their new narratives, they need supportive communities. 

<br>Hence letter writing, outsider witness, reflecting teams. 


<br>The truth of experience is not DISCOVERED, it is CREATED.
<br>Narrative accounts affect people's perceptions, stories don't just mirror life, they shape it. 
<br>Instead of trying to solve problems, the focus is on enriching the narratives of people's lives - bringing forth 'thick descriptions' of those aspects of people's narratives that life outside the influence of problems. 
<br>Alternative stories allow people to live out new identities, new possibilities for relationships, and new future. 
<br>People find meaning in their lives by experiencing, telling, and circulating stories of un-stories aspects of their lives and relationships. 
<br>Dominant discourses are socially constructed within our culture. 
<br><br><br>
<br>We 'story' and create meaning of life events using available dominant discourses - broad social stories, practices, assumptions, and expectations about how we should live.<br>
'Problems':
<br>Experienced when a person's personal life does not fit with these societal discourses and expectations. 
<br><br>
<br>Process involves separating the person from the problem. 
<br><br>
<br>Understanding Oppression: Dominant vs. Local Discourses

<br>Dominant discourses are culturally generated stories about how life should go. 
<br>Local discourses occur in our heads, our closer relationships, and marginalized communities. 


<br>Narrative therapists help clients become aware of how these different discourses are impacting their lives. 
<br><br>
<br>Avoid judgements about what is 'normal.'
<br>Avoid categorizing. 
<br>Avoid the idea of general principles of what causes problems or what resolves them. 
<br><br>
<br>The stories people tell themselves.

<br>Interpret their experience in unhelpful ways. 
<br>Patterns of tunnel vision. 


<br>Problem-saturated stories take hold and encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story. 
<br><br>
<br>Separate the problem-saturated stories to open space for:

<br>New and more constructive views of themselves.
<br>Look for unique outcomes

<br>'Sparking events'




<br><br>
<br>Deconstruction:

<br>View the problem as an external entity to start challenging its influence. 


<br>Unique Outcomes:

<br>Resistance to the problem's influence
<br>Opens room for counter stories


<br><br>
<br>Involves finding new ways to view, interact with, and respond to problems by defining the role of the problems in their lives. 
<br>Broadly involves the following phases:

<br>Meeting
<br>Listening
<br>Separating persons from problems
<br>Enacting preferred narratives
<br>Solidifying


<br>Process thickens and enriches a person's identity and life accounts. 
<br>Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time. 
<br>At the end of each meeting, the therapists asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
<br>Then, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
<br>Meetings are typically 60 minutes
<br>Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between)
<br><br>
<br>Collaborative
<br>Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem
<br>With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem
<br>Takes notes of what works and what doesn't
<br>Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation
<br><br>
<br>Meeting the person apart from the problem
<br>Separating people from problems:

<br>The problem is the problem


<br>Optimism and hope
<br>Co-author/co-editor
<br>Investigate reporter
<br><br>
<br>Problem-saturated stories
<br>Unique outcomes and sparkling events
<br>Dominant cultural and gender discourses
<br>Local and alternative discourses: 

<br>Attending to client language and meaning


<br><br>
<br>Holds a position of curiosity.
<br>Cherishes each person/family's unique stories. 
<br>Invite clients to develop and live out narratives that they prefer for their lives 
<br>Is decentered, not an expert, but an interested collaborator. 
<br>They are skilled at asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience carried in particular stories of the family. 

<br>Narrative Therapy Principles:

<br>Therapist influential, but decentered.
<br>Person separate from problem. 
<br>All problems have exceptions. 
<br>Opposite of problem is preferred. 
<br>Preferred story woven into identity. 
<br>Impact of relationships explored. 
<br>Deconstruct societal norms. 
<br>Personal decision making supported. 




<br><br>
<br>Instead of having a problem or being a problem, clients are struggling against their problems. 
<br>The problem is the problem. 

<br>Aren't interested in problem-maintaining sequences (strategic), structural issues (structural), or solutions (solution-focused), they are interested in the problem's impact on the family. 
<br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>:

<br>There is no absolute truth, instead shift toward deconstructing (reexamining) established truths that oppress people's lives. 




<br><br>
<br>People have good intentions (they do not need or want problems).
<br>People are profoundly influenced by the discourses around them. 
<br>People are not their problems. 
<br>People can develop alternative empowering stories once separated from their problems and the cultural myths they have internalized. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapist is interested in families' own evaluations of what is problematic and what is preferred. 
<br>Clients name how the problem is affecting their lives and relationships. 
<br>Therapist invites people to bring their 'best selves' into consideration of the problems that diminish their relationship and an exploration of how they might choose ways of living that diminish the effect of the problems on their relationship. 
<br><br>
<br>Reject categorizing people. 
<br>In the spirit of collaboration, the therapist situates themselves WITH clients. 
<br>They disclose the beliefs that inform their therapy so that clients can know what they're getting into. 
<br>Clients are encouraged to educate the therapist on their cultural predicaments and to correct the therapist when they make assumptions that don't fit for the client's experience. 
<br>Problems are likely to persist as long as unhelpful stories remain fixed and obscure other more helpful versions of events. 
<br><br>
<br>Cautious about applying terminology (diagnosis).
<br>Want to hear the family's stories of how the problems they name affect their lives and relationships. 
<br>When one of these problems appears to have invaded a relationship, it is the therapist's responsibility to ask questions that invite family members to consider the effects of that problem on their relationship, and to consider the stand they want to take in relation to it. 
<br>Problems are things that are separate from the families they afflict. 
<br>Therapists look for problematic discourses and offer families the opportunity to describe and evaluate the effects of those discourses on their relationships and lives. 
<br><br>
<br>Problem-saturated stories encourage people to respond to each other in ways that perpetuate the problem story
<br>Problems may be regarded as alien invaders
<br><br>
<br>Separate from problem-saturated stories (and destructive cultural assumptions)
<br>Open space for new and more constructive views of themselves. 
<br>Separate individuals from problems and unite the family to fight a common enemy
<br>Search for unique outcomes (sparkling events, exceptions) - times when they resisted the problem or behaved in ways that contradicted the problem story. 
<br><br>
<br>Help clients deconstruct unproductive stories in order to reconstruct new and more productive ones.

<br>Effects Questions:

<br>Elicit effects of the problem

<br>"How does the problem affect you? Your ideas about yourself? Your relationship?"
<br>"Clients can begin to notice areas of their lives where the problem has been less powerful."




<br>Identifying unique outcomes creates room for counterplots
<br><br>
<br>Telling and retelling, witnessing, and living out of multistoried lives.
<br>Once people notice how their stories are problem saturated and try to change their narratives, what they do and perceive will change as well. 
<br>Facilitate this process by asking questions to highlight un-storied events and to encourage meaning making around those events, then tie the meaning to memorable actions and contexts.
<br><br>
<br>Therapist negotiates the time of each next meeting as therapy progresses, one meeting at a time
<br>At the end of each meeting, the therapist asks whether the conversation has been useful, if it has, they ask how?
<br>Then, the therapist asks whether the family would like to meet again, and if so, when?
<br>Meetings are typically 60 minutes
<br>Length of therapy varies with each family (from a single consultation to years, most somewhere in between)
<br><br>
<br>CAUTION:

<br>Often therapy invites people to re-immerse themselves in their most problematic stories


<br>INSTEAD:

<br>narrative therapy invite families to explore, describe, and experience new directions in life that are already unfolding - new positions, new stories

<br>Counterstory




<br>Asking permission is central to the model
<br>At the start of the first meeting, the therapist ask if it would be okay to get to know the family in ways that have nothing to do with the problem before they describe what brought them to therapy.
<br>Later meetings often start by the therapist reading their notes from the previous session aloud and asking question, such as:

<br>Can you tell me about new developments that relate to what we were talking about last time


<br>Other times the therapist begins by wondering whether there have been important thoughts or events that connect to possibilities identified in the previous conversations
<br>Therapists use letters, documents, and videos to document and circulate alternative stories.

<br>For example, after a therapy session a therapist may write a letter posing questions that invite the family to develop an alternative story even further than they did in the session
<br>Or sending a document noting the stands the family has taken in regard to a problem
<br>Reading a document between sessions, and the conversations that can follow a reading, keeping a story alive and growing


<br><br>
<br>Collaborative
<br>Carefully observe, inquire into, and document the family's particular situation in relation to their problem. 
<br>With permission, share knowledge from previous work with families, and ask the family to evaluate the 'fit' and usefulness of that knowledge in relation to their problem.
<br>Takes note of what works and what doesn't
<br>Decentered, but influential - they have skills in facilitating a conversation

<br>Therapy is a relationship - a conversation


<br>Ask questions to expose gaps in problematic stories
<br>Open space for describing alternatives
<br>Invite families to add, subtract, or describe differently
<br>Encourage families to ask questions about the therapist's questions and comments
<br>The therapist wants the family to make meaning of their own experience, but the therapist's questions inevitably shape the inquiry. 
<br>Families are in a better position to interpret, making meaning of, and evaluate their own experiences than outsiders are, even trained outsiders
<br>Therapists have more questions than answers
<br><br>
<br>It sounds as though problem is part of your life now.
<br>How long have you been noticing this problem?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your life?
<br>How does the problem impact your relationships?
<br>Does problem have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
<br>What do you think about the effects the problem is having on your life?
<br>Are you accepting what problem is doing?
<br>Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
<br>Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what problem is doing?
<br>How would you prefer things to be?
<br><br>
<br>People's lives are multi-storied, each new telling of a story generates new possibilities for making meaning and taking action.
<br>The therapist invites family members to:

<br>Evaluate their current situation
<br>Name the problems involved
<br>Evaluate their relationship to those problems
<br>Take a stand in regard to them
<br>Tell more satisfying stories of their lives
<br>Evaluate the usefulness of the alternative stories


<br>In telling and living out the newly developed strands of alternative stories, clients evaluate aspects of their lives. 

<br>Private hopes and fears
<br>Family interactions
<br>Contributions of culture of origin
<br>Traditions, legacies


<br>Questioning:

<br>Is that the problem speaking?
<br>Whose values are guiding you in saying that?


<br>By exposing discouses that support problems, families can separate from the ways of being that are supported by those discourses, and identify and recognize preferred perceptions, attitudes, and actions. 
<br><br>
<br>What name would you give the problem?
<br>What is it like to experience the problem?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your life?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
<br>What talks have you have about the problem in your family? What impacts has that had?
<br>What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
<br>How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
<br>Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
<br>Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
<br>Is this conversation useful? How is it useful?
<br><br>
<br>Externalizing conversations
<br>Relatice influence questions

<br>Who's in charge, the person or the problem?


<br>Identifying unique outcomes

<br>Reading between the lines of the problem story
<br>Can you remember a time...


<br>Reauthoring

<br>What does it say about you...


<br>Illuminating or creating the counter-story
<br>Reinforcing the new story

<br>Finding audiences, supportive witnesses, allies
<br>Letter writing


<br>Deconstructing destructive cultural assumptions
<br><br><br>
<br>Listen to stories as stories.
<br>Be attentive and responsive to their intended meaning in telling the story.
<br>Ask about non-problematic aspects of the life of family members and of their relationship.
<br>Make sure the problem does not trick us into mistaking 'them' for 'the problem.'
<br>Unless families insist on moving quickly into talking about problems, spend a while listening to stories about their preferences.
<br>At some point, families spontaneously start to tell problem saturated stories.
<br>Try to put yourself in their shoes.
<br>Do not assume you understand the meaning their experience holds for them
<br>Listen and ask
<br>Listen with focused attention, patience, and curiosity while building a relationship of mutual respect and trust. 
<br><br>
<br>Listen 'deconstructively' to family stories - the listening is guided by the belief that those stories have many possible meanings.
<br>Ask families to tell their stories, look for opportunities to reflect our sense of what they said, they are saying, and to ask whether the meaning we are making fits with their intended meaning.
<br>We wonder aloud whether they are useful or desirable?
<br>And, what difference it makes to think of it 'that way'?
<br><br>
<br>Cultivate an awareness of the dominant (and dominating) stories in our society/
<br>Develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when we sense them at work win the lives and relationships of the families with whom we consult.
<br>There are 'taken-for-granted' realities at play.
<br>Deconstructive questions aim to examine problems in detail and expose discourses that suppose them, as well as those that might undermine those discourses. 
<br><br>
<br>The person/family is not the problem; the problem is the problem.
<br>Externalizing - problems are seen as separate from people.
<br>As we listen to people's stories, we listen for the ways they refer to their problems in their lives. If we hear names like 'fear' or 'blowing up,' we orient to those things as entities or processes that are external to families. 

<br>If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them.

<br>What would you call that something?


<br>What 'feeds' the problem?
<br>What 'starves' the problem?
<br>In what settings might the problem be useful?
<br>Who advocates for the problem?
<br>What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
<br>What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships?


<br><br>
<br>Naming a problem can open a way for examining it and thinking differently about it.
<br>As we ask people to evaluate their relationship to problems, they often tell us what they would prefer to have in their lives in place of the problem.
<br>What are the family's preferred directions?
<br>'Standing against' the problem.
<br><br>
<br>Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?

<br>Is the problem always with you?


<br><br>
<br>Listen for purposes, values, hopes, and commitments that are absent but implicit in family's narratives.
<br>Double listening. 
<br>If a person experiences despair, they must have hopes, dreams, or visions of the future that are not being fulfilled.
<br>If a person experiences injustive, they must have a conception of a just world.
<br>When we hear problematic stories, we listen for these sorts of implications.
<br><br>
<br>Stories need listeners as well as tellers.
<br>Attentive witnesses.
<br>The therapist serves as a witness, but including other witnesses, especially those involved in people's lives, can be very helpful.
<br>What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
<br>What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?

<br>It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions.

<br>Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
<br>What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them?




<br><br>
<br>Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who then amplify and accredit the stories that they witness.

<br>What stood out for them?
<br>What images it brought forward?
<br>How it resonated with their own experiences?
<br>Where they were transported by the interview?
<br>Situate their reflections in their own experience.
<br>Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives. 


<br><br>
<br>We are interested in documenting and circulating the new stories that emerge in therapy to thicken them and keep them alive. 
<br>We take notes in therapy to document new stories as they develop.

<br>We often refer back to these notes and read them aloud.


<br>We may create videos or documents about what they have learned, with their permission, that can be viewed or read by others facing similar problems. 
<br>We sometimes write letters between therapy sessions.

<br>In these letters, we ask questions that we did not ask in the therapy session.

<br>Our intention in letter writing is to thicken and extend the knowledge that has begun to emerge in session. 




<br>We might invite the family to share these documents with other people in their lives. 
<br><br>
<br>Opening space questions (unique outcomes)

<br>Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but didn't?


<br>Preference questions (preferred experiences)

<br>Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how?


<br>Story development questions

<br>How is this different from when arguing is in control?


<br>Meaning questions

<br>What does it say about you that you were able to...?


<br>Questions that extend the story into the future

<br>What do you predict...?


<br><br>
<br>Aims to separate the individual from the issue and externalize problems instead of internalizing them. 
<br><br>
<br>Reality is socially constructed.
<br>Reality is influenced by and communicated through language.
<br>Having a narrative can help us organize and maintain our reality.
<br>There is no 'objective reality' or absolute truth.
<br><br>
<br>Telling One's Story:

<br>A technique that involves re-telling your own story to find new meaning in old experiences. 


<br>Externalization Technique:

<br>Externalizing helps you separate you from your problems, making it easier to change something you don't like about yourself. 


<br>Deconstruction Technique:

<br>This technique involves breaking problems down into smaller, more specific issues that are easier to understand and address. 


<br>Unique Outcomes Technique:

<br>To help you see from a new, more positive perspective, broaden your view to see more of your own storylines, and focus on one that doesn't include your most pervasive problems. 


<br><br>
<br>Some families prefer a different kind of therapy than narrative, some are seeking instruction and expert advice.
<br>Regularly ask families how the therapy is going for them, and be open and willing to refer families if they are seeking a different kind of relationship. 
<br>Most families coming to therapy are concerned less with how the therapy is structured than with whether their family relationships improve
<br>Emphasis on 'practice-based evidence' over evidence-based practice
<br>More qualitative research rather than quantitative studies
<br>Little empirical support currently exists
<br>Randomized controlled trials of narrative therapy do not yet exist.

 <br>
<br>A biological model of living systems as whole entities that maintain themselves through continuous input and output from the environment; developed by Ludwig con Bertalanffy.
<br>Developed by <a data-href="Ludwig von Bertalanffy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a>

<br>A system is 'any entity maintained by the mutual interaction of its parts.'
<br>A system can be composed of smaller subsystems. 
<br>Every system is a subsystem of larger systems. 
<br>Open vs. Closed Systems

<br>Unlike machines, families change when necessary to adapt to new circumstances. 
<br>Systems:

<br>Individual and Nuclear Family (Nuclear Family, Family One Lives Within)
<br>Extended Family (Grandparents, Relatives, Significant Others)
<br>Social Level (School, Work, Friends, Neighbors, Faith)
<br>Multi-Cultural Level (Socioeconomic, Cultural, Ethnic, Racial, Geographical, Religious Context)
<br>Implications for MFTs:

<br>What shows up as one individual's behavior may be a product of the relationship. 
<br>MFTs use concepts to describe how people in a relationship contribute to what goes on between them (e.g., pursuer/distancer; overfunctioning/underfunctioning)
<br>Families tend to resist change, which explains why so many clients remain stuck despite heroic efforts to improve.

<br>Look to future where problems can be solved.


<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems. 
<br>The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions.

<br>Problem talk:

<br>Negative
<br>Focuses on the past
<br>Implies permanence of problems


<br>Solution talk:

<br>Hopeful
<br>Future oriented




<br><br>
<br>Avoid judgements about 'what is normal'
<br>Clients as experts in their situation
<br>Interest in language

<br>How people describe themselves and problems


<br>Focus on complaints presented

<br>Should not impose values by suggesting clients address other un-presented problems.


<br><br>
<br>Solutions to problems are unrelated to the development of the problem. 
<br>Tracking the development of the problem should be avoided. 
<br>Problem-focused thinking prevents effective solutions from being recognized. 
<br><br>
<br>Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. 
<br>Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. 
<br>The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. 
<br>The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. 
<br>The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable. 
<br><br>
<br>Resolve presenting complaint by helping clients do or think differently. 
<br>Trust clients to reach their own goals. 
<br>Help clients identify the problem-solving skills they have lost sight of. 
<br>Help clients locate their resources. 
<br><br>
<br>Time limited
<br>Sessions are made one at a time
<br>One may be enough
<br>Typical course includes 3-5 sessions
<br>Clients can return as-needed
<br>Often a week to a few weeks apart
<br>Once you know more of what works, do more of it
<br><br>
<br>Consultant
<br>Don't get bogged down in 'problem talk'
<br>Direct clients away from the problem-saturated narrative
<br>Therapists attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding
<br>Focus on the 'here and now'
<br>The future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes
<br>Assumes a position of 'not knowing'
<br><br>
<br>Very little intake information
<br>Avoid assessing how problems develop
<br>Concentrate on assessing future goals
<br>Therapy should only include people concerned about the problem
<br>Hear the client's constructions of their problems without preconceptions
<br><br>
<br>What do you think the problem is now?
<br>How will you know when the problem is solved?
<br>How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
<br>What will have to be different for that to happen in terms of your behavior, thoughts, and feelings?
<br>What will you notice that is different about others involved in the situation?
<br>What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?
<br><br>
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
<br>What needs to happen so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
<br>Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
<br><br>
<br>Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the clients to assess their current level of progress toward that goal by imagining a scale of 1-10. 

<br>Where 1 represented the problem at its worst, and 10 is the point at which the problem is gone or the clients are coping so well that its no longer problematic


<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapists help clients identify their preferred solution by:

<br>Talking about the problem, exceptions, and desired outcomes.
<br>Working with clients to take small active steps in this general direction each week. 


<br>This can take 1-10 sessions or it may take years depending on the complexity of the case. 
<br><br>
<br>How do we know when to stop meeting like this?
<br>Goals should be:

<br>Small
<br>Salient to clients
<br>Concrete, behavioral, measurable
<br>Achievable
<br>Involve hard work
<br>Start of something
<br>Involve new behaviors


<br>What will be present? What will be happening?
<br><br><br>
<br>Activates problem-solving mindset by giving people a vision of their goal.
<br>Helps clients to look beyond the problem to see what they really want

<br>Might not be the elimination of the problem but to be able to do things that the problem has been obstructing


<br>"Suppose one night there is a miracle and while you are sleeping the problem that brought you into therapy is solved."

<br>How would you know?
<br>What would be different?
<br>What will you notice the next morning that will tell you there has been a miracle?
<br>What will your family member notice?


<br><br>
<br>Directs clients' attention to times when they did not have the problem and expand on exceptions. 

<br>Helping families see that their problems have exceptions - times when they don't occur.


<br>Exceptions are solutions that families already have in their repertoire.
<br>Finding exceptions in the recent past is most useful because clients can remember them in greater detail; also since these exceptions just happened, it is more plausible they could happen again. 

<br>When in the recent past might the problem have happened but didn't (or was less intense or more manageable)?
<br>What's different about those times when the problem doesn't happen?

<br>How have you let your partner know when they do something that makes a positive difference to you?




<br><br>
<br>Punctuate with enthusiasm and support.
<br>Work to keep solution talk in the forefront.
<br>Listen carefully for an exception by getting more details about it and congragulating the family on it. 
<br>Connect the exception to the family's goals by asking how the goal would be reached if this exception were to occur more often.

<br>"How did you manage that?"
<br>"What keeps you going under such difficult circumstances?"
<br>"How come things aren't worse?"
<br>"What have you done to keep them from getting worse?"


<br><br>
<br>Help therapist and clients talk about vague topics (e.g., depression)

<br>On a scale from 1 to 10, how sad do you feel?


<br>Help clients to set goals in a clear/manageable manner.

<br>What do you think you need to do to achieve a 3?


<br><br>
<br>To be effective, compliments should point toward what to do more, not what to eliminate. 
<br>Compliments can be used to highlight successful strategies and keep clients focused on those that work. 
<br><br>
<br>Formula first-session task
<br>Do more of what works
<br>Do soemthing different
<br>Go slow
<br>Do the opposite
<br>The prediction task
<br><br>
<br>Devote to finding, amplifying, and measuring progress. 
<br>Inquire about progress, seeking detailed descriptions of any movement toward the family's goal and the clients' role in attaining it. 

<br>What's better?
<br>What happened that you liked?
<br>Tell me more. Walk me through how the two of you did that. 
<br>How did you keep things from getting worse?
<br>What's your idea about what might be helpful?


<br><br>
<br>How can we know when to stop meeting like this?
<br>What needs to be different in your life as a result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?
<br><br>
<br>Toxic positivity
<br>Therapist doesn't get to know client's past, which make it harder to understand and empathize with client
<br>The brief, goal-oriented focus does not work with every kind of person or problem
<br>It is easier to focus on the positive and solutions than to do the deep, difficult work of talking about trauma and the past

<br>Don Jackson developed the concept of <a data-href="Family Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/family-homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Homeostasis</a>. 
<br>He and <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a> were influential in developing family treatment. 

<br>They explored marital family therapy within the framework of communication analysis. 


<br>Family therapy was started by <a data-href="John Elderkin Bell (1951)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/john-elderkin-bell-(1951).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">John Elderkin Bell (1951)</a>, <a data-href="Don Jackson" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/don-jackson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Don Jackson</a>, <a data-href="Nathan Ackerman" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/nathan-ackerman.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nathan Ackerman</a>, and <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a>. 
<br><a data-href="Family Rules" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/family-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Rules</a>

<br>Rules can describe regularity rather than regulation. 
<br>Families only use a fraction of the full range of behaviors available to them. Therapy allows the family to access a wider range of behaviors. 


<br>Jackson's strategies are based on the premise that psychiatric problems resulted from the way people behave with each other. 

<br>To discern functional interactions from dysfunctional ones is to understand problems in context. 
<br>Even positive change can be a threat to the defensive order of things. 
<br>Some therapists believed symptoms serve a purpose by some families needing a sick member, which leads to parents victimizing scapegoated children.

<br>"Jay Haley was always something of a maverick. He entered the field without clinical credentials and established his reputation as a gadfly and critic. His initial impact came from his writings, in which he infused sarcasm with incisive analysis. "


<br>Strategies of Psychotherapy, <a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a>
<br>Covert messages are used in the struggle for control that characterizes many relationships
<br>Symptoms represent an incongruence between levels of communication

<br>Since symptomatic behavior wasn’t reasonable, Haley didn’t try to reason with patients to help them

<br>Defined therapy as a directive form of treatment and acknowledged his debt to Milton Erickson, with whom he studied hypnosis. In what he called brief therapy, Haley zeroed in on the context and possible function of a patient’s symptoms.

<br>therapist is directing patients to do precisely what they would do anyway and thus subtly gaining the upper hand
<br>The decisive techniques in brief therapy were directives

<br>it isn’t enough to explain problems to patients; what counts is getting them to do something about them.

<br>paradox here is that you can’t accidentally make a mistake if you are doing so deliberately
<br>The cybernetic principle here: People will do anything to get out of housework

<br><br>
<br>The hallmarks of strategic therapy are:

<br>Using a set of novel strategies to solve family problems. 
<br>Generating change rather than generating insight. 
<br>Circumventing resistance rather than dealing directly with it. 


<br><br>
<br>People are always communicating.
<br>All behavior is communicative
<br>One cannot not communicate. 
<br>All messages have report and command functions. 

<br>Report = CONTENT = Information = WHAT IS SAID
<br>Command = PROCESS = Underlying Relationship = HOW IT IS SAID


<br><br>
<br>Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. 
<br>Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. 
<br>The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. 
<br>Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. 
<br>Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. 
<br>The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life. 
<br>BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. 
<br>The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as, how they view the problem, themselves, and each other. 
<br>Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. 
<br>If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. 
<br>Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. 
<br><br>
<br>What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. 
<br>The problems clients being to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. 
<br>How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. 
<br>The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. 
<br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (positive feedback loops) that maintain an impasse. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The rules or regularities of family interaction that operate to preserve family stability. 
<br><br>
<br>The conservation aspect of family systems (similar to cybernetic concept of negative feedback).
<br><br><br><br>
<br>When a specific behavior within a system changes. 
<br><br>
<br>When the rules of a system change. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Rules are typically unspoken, and govern most behavior. 
<br>When rules promote rigid attempted solutions, it isn't just the behavior, but the rule needs to change. 

<br>When a specific behavior within a system changes = <a data-href="First-Order Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/first-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">First-Order Change</a>
<br>When the rules of the system change = <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a>


<br><br>
<br>Families are stuck in a spiraling positive feedback loop. 
<br>They make common sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. 

<br>For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums. 


<br>The job is simply to get the family moving again. 
<br>Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. 
<br><br>
<br>Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. 
<br>MRI:

<br>The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. 


<br>Haley:

<br>Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around).


<br>Milan:

<br>Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. 


<br><br>
<br>MRI Group:

<br>Carefully defining the presenting problem and figuring out why it is perpetuated. 
<br>Non-historic and symptom focused. 


<br>Haley and Madanes:

<br>Examine behavioral sequences around the problem. 
<br>Examine structural anomalies (weak parental hierarchies, cross-generational coalitions)


<br>Milan Group:

<br>Preliminary hypothesis tested using circular questioning (systemic explanations). 


<br><br>
<br>Find the most motivated person in the system. 
<br>Gain clear understanding of problem (symptom).
<br>"What will be the first signs that things are getting better?"
<br>Inquire about attempted solutions. 
<br>Observe and interrupt problem-maintaining sequences. 
<br>Use therapeutic paradox. 
<br>Family encourages depressed member to be sad so he feels less guilt for not being happy. 
<br><br>
<br>The solution is to deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it should not be. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. 
<br><br>
<br>Haley joins and interviews the entire family. 

<br>Social Stage -&gt; Problem Stage -&gt; Interaction Stage -&gt; Goal-Setting Stage -&gt; Task-Oriented Stage


<br><br>
<br>Each family member should speak and introduce themselves. 
<br>Therapist should ensure problems are not discussed until everyone can speak. 
<br>Therapist should examine family seating arrangements to assess organization. 
<br>Keep conclusions tentative. 
<br><br>
<br>Shift to the therapy stage. 
<br>Inquire why the family is there and what the problem is. 
<br>Be general and ambiguous so the family can expand. 
<br>Respect the family hierarchy to gain cooperation. 
<br>Treat those who have power and influence in the family with respect. 
<br>Therapist should not share observations with the family. 
<br>Therapist should think of the problems in terms of more than one person. 
<br><br>
<br>It is critical family members interact with one another rather than with the therapist. 
<br>Therapist should redirect family members toward each other. 
<br>Assess family organization through interactions. 
<br><br>
<br>Families need to define desired changes. 
<br>Therapist can act as wise advisor and assist the family in setting goals. 
<br><br>
<br>Use of directives (interventions aimed at targeting and changing specific behaviors).
<br><br>
<br>Pre-Session, Session, Intersession, Intervention, Post-Session Discussion
<br>Positive connotation (reframing without blaming)
<br>Circular questioning
<br>Team approach (Reflecting team, greek chorus)
<br>Neutrality
<br><br>
<br>Responsible for guidance of treatment. 

<br>We are going to focus on what the problem is. 


<br>Be aware of timing and pacing. 

<br>Meet client where they are. 


<br>Take the time (to form treatment plans)

<br>Respond to subtle pressure from clients. 
<br>Avoid attempting interventions prematurely. 

<br>Gather enough data about where the client is at before making attempts at intervention. 




<br>Use of Qualifying Language:

<br>"I have a suggestion to make, but I am not sure how much it will accomplish. It will depend on your ability to use your imagination..."


<br>Getting client to be specific. 
<br>Taking one-downmanship.

<br>The inherent power difference in therapy


<br>Determining the format of meeting. 

<br>Individual vs. Conjoint
<br>In what situation will individual session be beneficial?


<br><br>
<br>'Window Shopper' Client:

<br>Re-negotiate contract
<br>Working with the complainant
<br>Get them down to business


<br>Restrictive Client:

<br>Ask permission to redirect
<br>Setting specific boundary


<br><br><br>
<br>Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist to understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. 
<br>Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. 

<br>Never tell client why we do this. 


<br><br>
<br>The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about.
<br>Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. 
<br>As soon as a family member is overwhelmed they are instructed to make a list of all of the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. 
<br><br>
<br>Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. 
<br>"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation." (Piercy et al., 1996)
<br>Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions:

<br>"Who makes you depressed?"
<br>"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?"


<br>Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change.

<br>For example: When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums. 


<br>The job is simply to get the family moving again. 
<br>Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. 
<br><br>
<br>Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems. 
<br>MRI:

<br>The way to resolve problems is to reverse the misguided solutions that have been maintaining them. 


<br>Haley:

<br>Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around).


<br>Milan:

<br>Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. 


<br><br>
<br>MRI Group:

<br>Carefully defining the presenting problem and figuring out why it is perpetuated. 
<br>Non-historic and symptom focused. 


<br>Haley and Madanes:

<br>Examine behavioral sequences around the problem. 
<br>Examine structural anomalies (weak parental hierarchies, cross-generational coalitions)


<br>Milan Group:

<br>Preliminary hypothesis tested using circular questioning (systemic explanations). 


<br><br>
<br>Find the most motivated person in the system. 
<br>Gain clear understanding of problem (symptom).
<br>"What will be the first signs that things are getting better?"
<br>Inquire about attempted solutions. 
<br>Observe and interrupt problem-maintaining sequences. 
<br>Use therapeutic paradox. 
<br>Family encourages depressed member to be sad so he feels less guilt for not being happy. 
<br><br>
<br>The solution is to deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it should not be. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. 
<br><br>
<br>Haley joins and interviews the entire family. 

<br>Social Stage -&gt; Problem Stage -&gt; Interaction Stage -&gt; Goal-Setting Stage -&gt; Task-Oriented Stage


<br><br>
<br>Each family member should speak and introduce themselves. 
<br>Therapist should ensure problems are not discussed until everyone can speak. 
<br>Therapist should examine family seating arrangements to assess organization. 
<br>Keep conclusions tentative. 
<br><br>
<br>Shift to the therapy stage. 
<br>Inquire why the family is there and what the problem is. 
<br>Be general and ambiguous so the family can expand. 
<br>Respect the family hierarchy to gain cooperation. 
<br>Treat those who have power and influence in the family with respect. 
<br>Therapist should not share observations with the family. 
<br>Therapist should think of the problems in terms of more than one person. 
<br><br>
<br>It is critical family members interact with one another rather than with the therapist. 
<br>Therapist should redirect family members toward each other. 
<br>Assess family organization through interactions. 
<br><br>
<br>Families need to define desired changes. 
<br>Therapist can act as wise advisor and assist the family in setting goals.

<br>A family is functional to the degree that it nurtures its members to negotiate well the demands of the outside world. 
<br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> set limits distinguishing subsystems from one another in varying permeability (from diffuse to rigid).
<br>Subsystems separated by a diffuse boundary are enmeshed, whereas subsystems separated by a rigid boundary are disengaged.

<br>Predictable sequences or organized patterns in which families interact
<br>A set of rules governing behavior patterns

<br>Reciprocal and complementary functions. 
<br>Parental involvement with children, over versus under involvement. 
<br>Structure is expressed through transactional patterns such as:

<br>Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. 
<br>Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. 
<br>Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective.

<br>Subsystems are often formed based on the patterns of interactions in a family. 
<br>Patterns of interaction are largely based on roles and rules.

<br>Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. 
<br>Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system.

<br>Rigid Boundaries (Disengaged Subsystem)

<br>Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in <a data-href="Disengagement" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/disengagement.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Disengagement</a>.
<br>Disengaged systems are independent, but isolated.
<br>On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. But limits affection and support.

<br><br>
<br>Assumptions:

<br>The family could have developed a structure different from the dysfunctional one now being displayed. 
<br>The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. 
<br>Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. 
<br>Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.
<br>The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. 
<br>The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families seek help for a specific problem. 
<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. 
<br>Exploring dynamics of interaction. 
<br>Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.
<br>The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. 
<br>The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. 


<br>Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. 
<br><br>
<br>Theoretical Formulations:

<br>Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. 

<br>Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. 
<br>Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. 


<br>Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. 
<br>All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. 

<br>Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. 




<br><br>
<br>The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. 

<br>The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. 
<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family.


<br><br>
<br>Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. 

<br>But rather by a functioning structure


<br>Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. 

<br>Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. 
<br>Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. 


<br><br>
<br>Problems arise when there are:

<br>Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions
<br>Inflexible structures
<br>Failure to adjust to changing circumstances

<br>Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment. 




<br><br>
<br>The ultimate goal of therapy is structural changes to the family

<br>Alter the family structure so that the family can solve its own problems. 
<br>General goal: create or strengthen executive subsystem


<br><br>
<br>Therapists have two types of assessment tools:

<br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> 
<br>Spontaneous behavior sequences
<br>Enactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems
<br>Therapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences. 


<br><br>
<br>Joining and accommodating (effective therapy requires challenge and confrontation)

<br>"The structural therapist needs to relate to family members in a way that validates their experience but does not preclude a challenge to the status quo."


<br>Working with interaction (Use of enactments)
<br>Mapping structural patterns (Observing enmeshment and disengagement)
<br><br>
<br>Focus on the underlying family structure:

<br>Highlight and modify interactions
<br>Intensity (interrupt rigid and difficult patters)
<br>"Challenging to be effective must be predicated on the client's strengths. Contrary to a common misconception, it is not the 'opposite' of joining. Joining and challenging need to be seen as simultaneous qualities in any therapeutic intervention."
<br>Help people do things themselves
<br>Therapists can invite family members to participate and interact in ways that will 

<br>Help them function more efficiently

<br>Became the director of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic in 1965. 
<br>In 1981, Minuchin started his own center in New York, where he continued to practice and teach until 1996, when he retired and moved to Boston. He retired (again) and moved to Boca Raton, Florida, in 2005, where he conducted professional trainings and taught courses at Nova Southeastern University until his death in 2017.

<br>


<br>One of the reasons family therapy can be difficult is that families often appear as collections of individuals who affect one another in powerful but unpredictable ways. 
<br>Structural family therapy offers a framework that brings order and meaning to those transactions. The consistent patterns of family behavior are what allow us to consider us to have that they have structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families usually seek help for a specific problem. 

<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. This leads to the dynamic of interaction. 


<br>What structural family therapy adds to the equation is a recognition of the overall organization that regulates those interactions. 
<br>Families are organized in <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a> with <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> regulating the contact family members have with one another.

<br>To grasp a family's structure, you must look beyond their interactions to the organizational framework within which they occur, and you must keep in mind that what goes on in one part of a family is affected by the organization of the whole system. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. Once patterns are established, family members use only a fraction of the options available to them. 

<br>Patterns are set, roles assigned, and things take on a sameness and predictability. 


<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. 

<br>Sequences are isomorphic: They're structured. Modifying any of them may not change the basic structure, but altering the underlying structure will have ripple effects on all family transactions. 


<br>Family structure is shaped partly by universal and partly by idiosyncratic constraints. 

<br>Family members tend to have reciprocal and complementary functions. Often these become so ingrained that their origin is forgotten and they are presumed necessary rather than optional. 
<br>Whatever the pattern, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Although alternatives are available, family members are unlikely to consider them until changing circumstances produce stress in the system. 

<br>To understand these patterns, two things are necessary:

<br>A theoretical system that explains structure
<br>Seeking the family in action

<br>Structure becomes evident only when you observe actual interactions among family members. 










<br>Families are differentiated into subsystems - based on generation, gender, and function - which are demarcated by interpersonal boundaries, invisible barriers that regulate contact with others. 

<br>Interpersonal boundaries vary from rigid to diffuse. 

<br>Rigid boundaries:

<br>Restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement. Disengaged subsystems are independent but isolated. On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. On the other hand, disengagement limits affection and support. Disengaged families must come under extreme stress before they mobilize assistance. 


<br>Clear Boundary:

<br>Normal range.


<br>Diffuse Boundaries:

<br>Enmeshed subsystems offer closeness but at the expense of independence. Too much closeness cripples initiative. 






<br>Although structure suggests a static condition, family structure goes through a process of development. Families begin when two people in love decide to share their lives together, but a period of often difficult adjustment is required before they complete the transition from courtship to a functional partnership. They must learn to accommodate to each other's needs and styles of interaction. 

<br>The couple must also develop complementary patterns of support. Some patterns are transitory. Other patterns are more lasting. 

<br>Exaggerated complementary roles can detract from individual growth; moderate complementarity enables couples to divide functions to support and enrich each other. 


<br>Complementary patterns exist in all couples; they become problematic when they are so rigid that they create a dysfunctional subsystem. 

<br>The spouse subsystem must also develop a boundary that separates it from parents, children, and other outsiders. 

<br>A clear boundary enables children to interact with their parents but excludes them from the spouse subsystem. Parents and children eat together, play together, and share much of each other's lives; but there are some spouse functions that need not to be shared. 

<br>Unhappily, the clamorous demands of children often make parents lose sight of the need to maintain a boundary around the relationship. 


<br>In addition to maintaining privacy for a couple, a clear boundary supports a hierarchical structure in which parents occupy a position of leadership. 








<br>Unless therapists learn to look beyond the limited slice of ecology where they work to the larger social structures within which their work is embedded, their efforts may amount to little more than spinning wheels. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural therapists are able to explain what regulates families and why they behave as they do. 
<br><br>
<br>When two people join to form a couple, the structural requirements for the new union are <a data-href="Accommodation" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/accommodation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Accommodation</a> and <a data-href="Boundary Making" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundary-making.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundary Making</a>. 

<br>The first priority is mutual accommodation to manage the myriad details fo everyday living. They must coordinate daily rituals. 
<br>In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. 


<br>Each partner tends to be more comfortable with the level of proximity that existed in their own family. 

<br>Because these expectations differ, a struggle ensues that may be the most difficult of the new union. 


<br>Couples must also define a boundary between them and their original families. 
<br>The birth of a child transforms the structure of a new family into a parental subsystem and a child subsystem.

<br>Many men do not accept the role of father until their infants are old enough to respond to them. Thus, even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. 


<br>Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. 

<br>Minuchin (1974) warns therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. What distinguishes normal families is not the absence of problems but a functional structure for dealing with them. 

<br>Therapists should keep in mind that they may simply be in the process of modifying their structure to adjust to new circumstances. 




<br><br>
<br>Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure and when developmental transitions are reached. 

<br>Healthy families accommodate to changed circumstances; dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structure that are no longer working. 

<br>In disengaged families, boundaries are rigid, and the family fails mobilize support when it's needed. 

<br>If someone is disengaged in one relationship, they is likely to be preoccupied elsewhere. 


<br>In enmeshed families, boundaries diffuse, and family members become dependent on one another. Intrusive parents create difficulties by stunting the development of their children and interfering with their ability to solve their own problems. 

<br>Families as enmeshed or disengaged, it's more accurate to describe particular subsystems as being enmeshed or disengaged. Enmeshment and disengagement tend to be reciprocal. 

<br>A frequently encountered pattern is the enmeshed mother/disengaged father syndrome - "The signature arrangement of the troubled middle-class family."






<br>Skewed relationships, whatever their origin, can be problematic, though no one individual should be expected to do all the changing. 


<br>Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair, or weak and ineffective. In the first case, children may find themselves unprotected because of a lack of guidance; in the second, their growth as individuals may be impaired and power struggles may ensue. Just as a functional hierarchy is necessary for a family's stability, flexibility is necessary for it to adapt to change. 

<br>One problem often seen by family therapists arises when parents who are unable to resolve conflicts between themselves divert the focus of concern onto a child. Instead of worrying about themselves, they worry about the child. 
<br>An equally common patter is for the parents to argue through the children. 

<br>Both may be critical of the other's way, but they perpetuate each other's behavior with their own. the result is a <a data-href="Cross-Generational Coalition" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/cross-generational-coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cross-Generational Coalition</a>.




<br>Some families function well when the children are young but are unable to adjust to an older child's needs for discipline. Young children in enmeshed families receive wonderful care. Although such parents may be too tired from caring for the children to have much time for each other. 

<br>If these doting parents don't teach their children to obey the rules and respect authority, the children may be unprepared to negotiate their entrance into school. 

<br>Since they have not learned to accommodate to others, they may be rejected by their schoolmates. Such children often become depressed. In other cases, children enmeshed with their parents become discipline problems at school, in which case school authorities may initiate counseling. 




<br>Blended families either readjust their boundaries or soon experience transitional conflicts. 

<br>The sooner such families enter treatment, the easier it is to help them adjust to the transition. 


<br>An important aspect of structural family problems is that symptoms in one member reflect not only that individual's interactions but also other relationships in the family. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural therapy was once a strictly action-oriented approach. Family therapy pioneers differentiated themselves from psychoanalysis by aggressively ignoring emotion and cognition - why family members interact the way they do - and the past - how they learned to act that way - in order to focus on interactions in the present. 

<br>Structural family therapy has evolved to consider not only how family members interact but also how and why they learned to do so. 


<br><br>
<br>Structural treatment is designed to alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. The goal of therapy is structural change; problem solving is a by-product. 
<br>The idea that family problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures has led to the criticism of structural family therapy as pathologizing. 
<br>Structural problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances. 

<br>Structural therapists see their work as activating latent adaptive patterns that are already in families' repertoires. 


<br>Most important is the creation of an effective hierarchy. Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. 
<br>With enmeshed families the goal is to differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. 
<br>With disengaged families the goal is to increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. 
<br><br>
<br>A therapist produces change by <a data-href="Joining" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/joining.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Joining</a> the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating dormant structural alternatives. Joining gets the therapist into the family; accommodating to their style gives them leverage; and restructuring transforms the family structure. 

<br>To join, a therapist conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. 

<br>Only after successful joining with a family is it fruitful to attempt restructuring - the often dramatic confrontations that challenge families and encourage them to change. 




<br>The first task is to understand the family's view of their problems. This is accomplished by tracking their perspectives in the words they use to explain them and in the behavior with which they demonstrate them. 
<br>Observing and modifying the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session. Structural therapists work with what they see, not what family members describe. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Structural therapists make assessments by observing how family members respond to their dilemmas. 
<br>Structural therapists make no assumptions about how families should be organized. 

<br>It's the fact that a family seeks therapy for a problem they have been unable to solve that gives a therapist license to assume that something about the way they are organized may not be working for them. 


<br>Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. But sometimes even the whole family isn't enough because the family may not be the only relevant context. 
<br>Some problems may be treated as problems of the individual. 

<br>"Pathology may be inside the patient, in their social context, or in the feedback between them."


<br>Making an assessment is best done by focusing on the presenting problem and exploring the family's response to it. 

<br>To carry this assessment further, a structural therapist would explore the relationship between the parents. 

<br>The assessment would also involve talking with the parents about growing up in their own families in order to explore how their pasts helped shaped the way they react to things now. 




<br>Minuchin described the process of assessment as organized in four steps:

<br>Ask questions about the presenting complaint until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family.
<br>Help family members see how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. 
<br>A brief exploration of the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. 
<br>Explore options that family members like to interact in more productive ways to create a shifting the family structure and help resolve the presenting complaint. 

<br>Opening questions should give family members a chance to tell their stories and express their feeilngs. On the other hand, a therapis tshould not accept at face value a family's description of their problems as residing entirely within one individual. 

<br>The point is not to shift blame but to open a discussion about how family members' interactions may be influencing one another. 






<br><br>
<br>In Families and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1974) listed three overlapping stages in structural family therapy. The therapist:

<br>Joins the family in a position of leadership.
<br>Maps the family's underlying structure.
<br>Intervenes to transform this structure. 


<br>In general, structural family therapy follows these steps:

<br>Joining and accommodating
<br>Enactment
<br>Structural Mapping
<br>Highlighting and Modifying Interactions
<br>Boundary Making
<br>Unbalancing
<br>Challenging Unproductive Assumptions


<br><br>
<br>Family members expect to be told they are doing something wrong, and they are prepared to defend themselves. 

<br>The therapist must first disarm defenses and ease anxiety. This is done by building an alliance of understanding with each member of the family. 

<br>Greet the family, then ask for each person's view of the problem. Listen carefully, and acknowledge what you hear. 




<br>The first step in breaking the cycle of misunderstanding is to offer the empathy family members may be temporarily unable to provide one another. Hearing and acknowledging each person's account of the family's sorrows provides further information - and begins to release family members from the resentment of unheard feelings. Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. 

<br>A therapist shows respect for parents by honoring their authority. 

<br>Children have special concerns and capacities. they should be greeted gently and asked simple questions. 


<br>Those who wish to remain silent should be allowed to do so. 
<br>Important to join powerful family members as well as angry ones. 

<br>Important to reconnect with such people at frequent intervals, particularly when things begin to heat up.




<br><br>
<br>Getting family members to talk with one another runs counter to their expectations. They expect to present their case to an expert and then be told what to do. 
<br>If a therapist begins by giving each person a chance to speak, usually one will say something about another than can be a springboard for an enactment. 
<br>Working with enactments requires three operations:

<br>The therapist notices a problematic sequence. 
<br>The therapist initiates an enactment. 
<br>The therapist guides the family to modify the enactment. 


<br>Once an enactment is begun, a therapist can discover many things about a family's structure. 
<br>Families demonstrate enmeshment by interrupting, speaking for one another, doing things for children that they can do for themselves, or constantly arguing. In disengaged families you may see a husband sitting impassively while his wife cries, a total absence of conflict, a surprising ignorance of important information about the children, or a lack of conern for each other's interests. 
<br>When an enactment breaks down, a therapist intervenes in one of two ways:

<br>Commenting on what went wrong
<br>Pushing them to keep going


<br><br>
<br>Preliminary assessments are based on interactions in the first session. In later sessions these formulations are refined or revised. 
<br>Families quickly induct therapists into their culture. 

<br>It is important to develop structural hypotheses relatively early in the process. 


<br>Structural assessments take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. And they include all family members. 
<br><br>
<br>Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. Recognizing their structural implications requires focusing on process, not content. 
<br>The trick is to modify this pattern. This may require forceful intervening, or <a data-href="Intensity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/intensity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intensity</a>.

<br>Structural therapists achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions. It helps if you know what to say. 


<br><a data-href="Coalition" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/coalition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coalition</a>:
<br>Intensity can also be achieved by extending the duration of a sequence beyond the point where homeostasis is reinstated. 

<br>Sometimes intensity requires repitition of a theme in a variety of contexts. 


<br>An alternative strategy is to use <a data-href="Empathy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/empathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Empathy</a> to help family members get beneath the surface of their defensive wrangling. 

<br>Once these more genuine emotions are articulated, they can serve as a basis for clients reconnecting with each other in a less defensive manner. 


<br><a data-href="Shaping Competence" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/shaping-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Competence</a>

<br>Another method of modifying interactions. 
<br>Intensity is used to block the stream of interactions. Shaping competence is like altering the direction of the flow. By reinforcing positives, structural therapists help family members use functional alternatives that are already in their repertoire. 

<br>A sense of timing helps. 




<br><br>
<br>In enmeshed families, interventions are designed to strengthen boundaries. Family members are urged to speak for themselves, interruptions are blocked, and dyads are helped to finish conversations without intrusion. 
<br>Although structural therapy is begun with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be help with individuals or subgroups to strengthen their boundaries. 
<br>Disengaged families tend to avoid conflict and thus minimize interaction. A structural therapist intervenes to challenge conflict avoidance and block detouring in order to help disengaged family members break down the walls between them. 

<br>When beginners see disengagement, they tend to think of ways to encourage positive interaction. In fact, disengagement is usually a way of avoiding arguments. Therefore, people isolated from each other usually need to confront their differences. 


<br>Problems are usually seen as the result of what someone else is doing, and solutions are thought to require that others change. Structural therapists move family discussions from linear to circular perspectives by stressing <a data-href="Complementarity" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/complementarity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Complementarity</a>.
<br><br>
<br>In boundary making, a therapist aims to realign relationships between subsystems. In unbalancing, the goal is to change the relationship within a subsystem. What often keeps families stuck in stalemate is that members in conflict are balanced in opposition and, as a result, remain frozen in inaction. In unbalancing, the therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. 
<br>Unbalancing is part of a struggle for change that sometimes takes on the appearance of combat. But real combat is between them and fear - fear of change - 
<br><br>
<br>Its practitioners sometimes challenge the way clients see things. Changing the way family members interact offers alternative views of their situation. The converse is also true: changing the way family members view their situation enable them to change the way they interact. 
<br>Sometimes therapists act as teachers, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. Doing so is likely to be a structuring maneuver and must be done in a way that minimizes resistance. 
<br>Effective challenges describe what people are doing and its consequences. However, in order for family members to hear what is being pointed out, they must not feel attacked. Saying 'That's interesting' before pointing something out make it an object of curiosity rather than an occasion for defensiveness. Moreover, although it's tempting to tell people what they should do, doing so reduces the likelihood of them learning to see what they are doing - and its consequences. 
<br><br>
<br>Greater emphasis on helping families understand their organization and less of the combative attitude that sometimes characterized therapists several decades ago. What's important to keep in mind is that structural family therapy isn't a set of techniques; it's a way of looking at families. 
<br>Some of the strongest empirical support for structural family therapy comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. 

<br>Family conflict can precipitate ketoacidosis crises in children with diabetes. 

<br>These children's manifest distress was accompanied by dramatic increases in free fatty acid levels, a measure related to ketoacidosis. This study provided strong confirmation of the clinical observation that children with psychosomatic illnesses are involved in the regulation of stress between their parents. 




<br>The 90% improvement rate is impressive, especially compared with the usual 30% mortality rate for this disorder. 

<br>The positive results at termination were maintained at follow-up intervals of several years. Several more recent studies have replicated these findings and shown that structural family therapy is effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. 


<br>Structural family therapy has also been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic asthmatics and psychosomatically complicated cases of diabetes. 
<br>Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. 

<br>Example:

<br>Families of the Slums by Minuchin




<br>Duke Stanton showed that structural family therapy can be effective for people addicted to drugs and their families. 

<br>Symptom reduction was significant with structural family therapy; the level of positive change was more than double that achieved in the other conditions, and these positive effects persisted at follow-up of 6 and 12 months. 


<br>Structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disrupting behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD). Structural family therapy has been successful in reducing the likelihood that African American and Latino youth would initiate drug use, engaging and retaining families in treatment. 
<br>Structural family therapy is equal in effectiveness to communication training and behavioral management training in reducing negative communication, conflicts, and expressed anger between adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. 

<br>Structural family therapy has also been effective for treating adolescent disorders, such as conduct disorders. 


<br>Structural Ecosystems Therapy has been shown to improve family functioning and in turn boost drug abstinence for women living with HIV or AIDS. 

<br>A structural family therapy approach also yielded encouraging results in the alleviation of maternal depressive symptoms and mixed results of child functioning. 


<br><br>
<br>The structural model directs clinicians to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and constrains those interactions.
<br><br>
<br>The most important tenet of this approach is that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. 

<br>Therapists who fail to consider the entire family's structure and intervene in only one subsystem are unlikely to effect lasting change. 


<br>Subsystems are units of the family based on function. 

<br>Subsystems are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. In healthy families boundaries are clear enough to protect independence and permeable enough to allow mutual support. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries; disengaged families have rigid boundaries. 


<br>Once they've gained a family's trust, therapists promote family interaction while they assume a decentralized role. From this position they can observe and make a structural assessment, which includes the problem and the organization that supports it. These assessments are framed in terms of boundaries and subsystems, easily conceptualized as two-dimensional maps used to suggest avenues for change. 
<br>After they have successfully joined and assessed a family, structural therapists proceed to activate formant structures using techniques that alter alignments and shift power within and between subsystems. These restructuring techniques are concrete and sometimes forceful. However, their success depends on as much on effective joining and assessment as on the power of the techniques themselves.

<br>Rigid Boundaries (Disengaged Subsystem)

<br>Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in <a data-href="Disengagement" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/disengagement.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Disengagement</a>.

<br><br>
<br>Assumptions:

<br>The family could have developed a structure different from the dysfunctional one now being displayed. 
<br>The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant. 
<br>Therapy attempts to activate what is already there, but latent. 
<br>Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions.
<br>The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. 
<br>The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families seek help for a specific problem. 
<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. 
<br>Exploring dynamics of interaction. 
<br>Recognizing the overall organizations of the family regulates those interactions.
<br>The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regulate contact between members. 
<br>The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. 


<br>Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. 
<br><br>
<br>Theoretical Formulations:

<br>Basic assumption is that families are organized structurally in certain ways to cope with stress. 

<br>Organized patterns ensure the survival of the system, all patterns have this purpose. 
<br>Systems both responds and reacts to internal and external stressors. 


<br>Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. 
<br>All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. 

<br>Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. 




<br><br>
<br>The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. 

<br>The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to each other. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. 
<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family.


<br><br>
<br>Healthy families not defined by the abundance of problems. 

<br>But rather by a functioning structure


<br>Healthy families can modify their structure to accommodate changing circumstances. 

<br>Unhealthy families increase rigidity of structures that are no longer functional. 
<br>Less adaptive families increase rigidity of structures and are no longer functional. 


<br><br>
<br>Problems arise when there are:

<br>Weak hierarchies; conflict avoidance; cross-generational coalitions
<br>Inflexible structures
<br>Failure to adjust to changing circumstances

<br>Failure to reorganize themselves in order to deal with stresses in the home environment. 




<br><br>
<br>The ultimate goal of therapy is structural changes to the family

<br>Alter the family structure so that the family can solve its own problems. 
<br>General goal: create or strengthen executive subsystem


<br><br>
<br>Therapists have two types of assessment tools:

<br>Spontaneous behavior sequences
<br>Enactments occur when a therapist stimulates a family to demonstrate how they handle problems
<br>Therapists guide the family how to modify the enactment, creating new behavior sequences. 


<br><br>
<br>Joining and accommodating (effective therapy requires challenge and confrontation)

<br>"The structural therapist needs to relate to family members in a way that validates their experience but does not preclude a challenge to the status quo."


<br>Working with interaction (Use of enactments)
<br>Mapping structural patterns (Observing enmeshment and disengagement)
<br><br>
<br>Focus on the underlying family structure:

<br>Highlight and modify interactions
<br>Intensity (interrupt rigid and difficult patters)
<br>"Challenging to be effective must be predicated on the client's strengths. Contrary to a common misconception, it is not the 'opposite' of joining. Joining and challenging need to be seen as simultaneous qualities in any therapeutic intervention."
<br>Help people do things themselves
<br>Therapists can invite family members to participate and interact in ways that will 

<br>Help them function more efficiently

<br><br>Introduced by Sprenkle, Blow &amp; Dickey (1999), common factors in marriage and family therapy (MFT) have been discussed over the past two decades. Although the MFT common factors literature has grown, there are misconceptions and disagreements about their role in theory, practice, research, and training. This content analysis examined the contributions of the common factors paradigm to MFT theory, practice, research, and training over the past 20&nbsp;years. We identified 37 scholarly works including peer‐reviewed journal articles, books, and chapters. Using mixed methods content analysis, we analyze and synthesize the contributions of this literature in terms of theoretical development about therapeutic effectiveness in MFT, MFT training, research, and practice. We provide commentary on the substantive contributions that the common factors paradigm has made to these areas, and we discuss the implications and limitations of the common factors literature, and provide recommendations for moving common factors research forward.<br><br>

<br>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), long considered the gold standard for testing the effectiveness of treatment approaches and interventions, rest on the assumption that models and interventions are responsible for change.

<br>Common factors, rather than model-specific factors, are largely responsible for effective therapy. 


<br>Despite increased theoretical and empirical support for common factors, there has been continued debate about their usefulness in the MFT field. 
<br>The purpose of this content analysis is to critically analyze, synthesize, and clarify the contributions of the common factors paradigm to MFT theory, research, training, and practice. 
<br><br><br>
<br><a data-href="Common Factors" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/common-factors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Common Factors</a> are an umbrella term for the general mechanisms or variables associated with therapeutic change that are common across therapy models. 
<br>Common factors, also called general factors or mechanisms of change, are factors that contribute to change in psychotherapy. They are not the province of a specific model but instead are found in all therapies. 
<br>Common factors are further defined as broad and narrow. 

<br>Broad common factors include general aspects of treatment such as client and therapist factors, extra-therapeutic variables (e.g., foruitous events, social support), therapist-client relationship factors, and the client's expectancy of the success of therapy. Empirical support for common factors is grounded in outcome studies and meta-analyses of therapeutic effectiveness. 
<br>Narrow common factors refer to aspects of treatment found in several models that go by different names. 


<br>Different models of therapy share common processes or goals, otherwise defined as <a data-href="Model-Dependent Common Factors" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Model-Dependent Common Factors" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Model-Dependent Common Factors</a>. These include shifting each partner's cognition, affect, or behavior; reattribution; reinforcement; desensitization; and psychoeducation and skills training. 

<br>What are some examples of common factors in your own work with the various theories? How often do they overlap?


<br><br>
<br>The MFT field has traditionally conceptualized and explained therapeutic effectiveness through the lens of models. 
<br>Therapy is effective because of the unique and particular philosophy or intervention of each therapeutic model. However, several meta-analyses of psychotherapy demonstrate this is not the care, finding no model of couple and family therapy consistently yielding better results than others. 
<br>It is important to critically examine the impact, strengths, and limitations of this paradigm as applied to MFT theory and practice. 
<br><br><br>
<br>What are the primary characteristics of common factors literature in the MFT field?
<br><br>
<br>What common factors are identified in the MFT literature?
<br>How do common factors researchers draw distinctions between change mechanisms, change process, and common factors?
<br>How do common factors contribute to the discussion about the therapeutic effectiveness of MFT?
<br>How do MFT scholars explain the relationship between common factors and models?
<br>How do common factors inform and enhance MFT practice, research, and training?
<br><br>
<br>How does the MFT common factors literature answer fundamental questions about therapeutic effectiveness and the process of change in therapy?
<br><br><br>
<br>We used the following criteria to determine whether to include works in our sample:

<br>Common factors are the primary focus of the work
<br>The authors discuss common factors as applied to the practice of MFT
<br>The work was published in a peer-reviewed journal or academic outlet between 1999 and early 2019. 


<br><br>
<br>The authors have written about common factors extensively. Throughout the data analysis and discussion of the results, we met to discuss our position in relationship to common factors. We engaged in this process to acknowledge our position of support for common factors and our belief in their role as important aspects of therapeutic change; we also recognize there are significant limitations to the existing literature. Our aim was to provide a rigorous, honest, and critical commentary of the common factors literature in MFT, and we continually reminded ourselves of this aim throughout the analysis.

<br><br>Determining the efficacy of therapeutic interventions is becoming an increasing political and ethical necessity. Comparative therapeutic outcome trials are most powerful when there is a precise specification, or manualization, of the forms that therapies took. Manuals have begun to be developed for structural/behavioral family therapy and couple therapy. The development of these manuals is often reliant on experts' self‐report, rather than a systematic analysis of the therapeutic process as it happens. This can limit their validity and applicability to standard clinical practice. In addition, no manuals exist which reflect less structured forms of family therapy aimed at incorporating systemic, postmodern and narrative frameworks. The feasibility of producing a workable manual that reflects the fluidity of such practices has been questioned. A research project to systematically create and test such a manual is reported. Multiple data sources and research methods, primarily qualitative, were applied to generate a rich specification of the therapy. In reporting these results the contents of various aspects of the final manual are indicated. Procedures to ensure that the prescribed practice is consistent with a widely used approach to systemic family therapy are also described. The manual will be an important tool for outcome research and therapeutic practice. The account of the research process should be helpful to researchers engaged in constructing a manual for other models of family therapy based on a rigorous analysis of actual practice. The manual itself is available for use by outcome researchers who wish to evaluate this widely used form of systemic family therapy.<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<br>There has been a tendency for the more easily specified and measurable to be privileged. It has been a common strategy for manuals to be defined and specified anecdotally by senior practitioners. These practices in manual development and outcome research may risk the development of a 'biased' evidence base. 
<br>Easily prescribable cognitive-behavior techniques applied to specific diagnostic categories have been manualized before more complex psychotherapeutic techniques with more general application.

<br>Have you experienced this in your clinical work? Have you struggled to find resources or anything to provide structure to your sessions? If some therapists have more manualized theories than others, does that create a difference in outcome for clients?


<br>Are we really systemic researchers if we are only observing the individual self-report data?

<br>Are there familial/relational measures looking at more than one person in the family? 


<br>How much of our understanding is the individuals that make up the system or the interactions between them?
<br>"The result is that therapists and researchers alike remain unclear about what constitutes effective family therapy."
<br>"Examples of manuals detailing less structured, systemic family therapy are limited, since until recently the ethos of these forms of family therapy has worked against anything that might look like a prescription of what the therapist should do."

<br>But have we? 


<br>Therapists were required to retrospectively rate their intentions in relation to the systemic practices they observed in videotape reviews of their own therapy practice. 

<br>Ratings of 26 possible intentions were given on a five-point Likert scale relating to the extent to which therapists felt they were being guided by this intention during their practice. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Manuals specify different modes of clinical practice and enable comparisons of model efficacy through controlled outcome trials. In order for the findings from outcome research to be clinically relevant and meaningful, the manuals used must offer a fair representation of practices within the contexts in which the therapy is usually delivered. 
<br>Within the systemic manuals that currently exist, there has been a tendency for the more easily specified and measurable to be privileged. It has also been a common strategy for manuals to be defined and specified anecdotally by senior practitioners in the field, with less reliance on therapy process research from clinical contexts. These current practices in manual development and outcome research may risk the development of a 'biased' evidence base. 
<br>Across psychotherapy, easily prescribable cognitive-behavior techniques applied to specific diagnostic categories have been manualized before more complex psychotherapeutic techniques with more general application. Within family therapy the strategy has resulted in more behaviorally oriented forms being manualized and shown to be effective for specific conditions. 
<br>A common criticism of outcome research is of a lack of generalizability to everyday practice. Participants are unrepresentative, as they have usually been screened to exclude any with multiple difficulties; the therapy is delivered to a higher. Standard and in more tightly defined form than is possible in normal practice; and most evidence will have accumulated about older forms of therapy. 

<br>More applicable research would be facilitated by the availability of a manual derived from representative current practice, in a format that allows for current developments and the emphases of clinics in which it would be implemented. It should also be designed to consider <a data-href="Second-Order Change" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/second-order-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Second-Order Change</a> with the usual range and complexity of family difficulties. 


<br><br>
<br>Family therapy is effective when compared with no treatment controls and, for some presenting difficulties, is more efficacious than individual interventions (e.g. marital distress, anorexia in young adolescents). Family therapy may also have advantages over individual treatments in relation to engagement and client ratings of satisfaction. Family therapy may also be more cost-effective than residential and inpatient treatments, but may not be sufficient in itself to address a variety of severe disorders and problems (e.g. schizophrenia, adolescents’ conduct difficulties).
<br>Systemic psychotherapy research is full of methodological flaws. Design issues, such as small and sometimes unrepresentative participant samples and the lack of credible no-treatment and alternative treatment controls, continue to undermine the conclusions of the research. 
<br>It is easy to become lost in the multitude of definitions of what constitutes the family therapy interventions assessed, if, that is, the researchers have defined the interventions at all. 

<br>The result is that therapists and researchers alike remain unclear about what constitutes effective family therapy. 


<br>Examples of manuals detailing less structured, systemic family therapy are limited, since until recently the ethos of these forms of family therapy has worked against anything that might look like a prescription of what the therapist should do.
<br><br>
<br>The key stages in the research process

<br>Semi-structured interviews with five expert family therapists, with qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
<br>Observational ratings of fifteen videotapes of expert family therapy sessions, using a specifically developed observational rating schedule and employing quantitative analysis. 
<br>Development of a draft manual. 
<br>Trial of the manual in practice by three experienced family therapists to obtain qualitative feedback and ascertain quantitative self-report of adherence. 


<br><br>
<br>Semi-structured interviews were conducted by the first author with five expert family therapists from LFTRC. 
<br>An adapted version of the Brief Structured Recall (BSR) method was used to structure interviews. 
<br><br>
<br>Therapists were required to retrospectively rate their intentions in relation to the systemic practices they observed in videotape reviews of their own therapy practice. 
<br>The process used to elicit accounts of the kinds of therapeutic practice the therapists would report when confronted with samples of their own practice. Ratings of 26 possible intentions were given on a five-point Likert scale relating to the extent to which therapists felt they were being guided by this intention during their practice. 
<br><br>
<br>Using the BSR method, therapists were also asked to comment on the theoretical ideas that were informing their practice. 
<br>Through this recursive process the following guiding principles were produced:

<br>Systems Focus: In working systemically the central focus should be upon the system rather than the individual, particularly in relation to the difficulties and issues that the family system brings to therapy. 
<br>Connections and Patterns: In understanding relationships and difficulties within systems it will be important for the therapist to consider the connections between circular patterns of behaviors within systems. This process of therapy should enable family members to consider these connections from new and/or different perspectives. 
<br><a data-href="Circular Causality" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/circular-causality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Circular Causality</a> (Circularity): Patterns of behavior develop within systems, which are repetitive and circular in nature and also constantly evolving. 
<br><a data-href="Social Constructionism" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/narrative-family-therapy/keywords-and-concepts/social-constructionism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Constructionism</a>: Meaning is created in the social interactions that take place between people and is thus context dependent and constantly changing. The negotiation of a shared meaning, constructed afresh in each conversation, takes precedence over the concept of a single external reality. 
<br>Strengths and Solutions: the therapist should take a non-pathologizing, positive view of the family system, and the current difficulties they are struggling with. The therapist should attend to the strengths and solutions in the stories that the family system brings to therapy. 
<br>Cultural Context: The therapist should consider the importance of context, in relation to the cultural meanings and narratives within which people live their lives, including issues of race, gender, disability, religion, and class. The relationship between these narratives, the therapeutic relationship and its context, as well as the wider context for the therapeutic team and the family, should be an important consideration at the point of referral and throughout the therapy. 
<br>Co-Constructed Practice: In therapeutic interactions reality is co-constructed between the therapist (and team) and the people with whom they meet. 
<br>Reflexivity: Therapists should aim to apply systemic thinking to themselves and thus reject any thinking about families and their processes that does not also apply to therapists and therapy. In order to use self-reflexivity it will be necessary for therapists to be alert to their own constructions, functioning, and prejudices. 
<br>Narratives and Language: behaviors and beliefs form the basis of stories or narratives, which are constructed by, around, and between individuals and the system itself. The language that is used to describe these narratives and the interactions between individuals construct the reality of their every day lives. 
<br><a data-href="Power" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/power.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Power</a>: The therapist should take a reflexive stance in relation to the power differentials that exist within the therapeutic relationship, and within the family relationships. 
<br><a data-href="Constructivism" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/constructivism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Constructivism</a>: The idea that each person constitutes an autonomous meaning system and will interpret and make sense of information from this frame of reference. 


<br><br>
<br>The systemic family therapy methods outlined through this process were: Teamwork, including the use of a designated ‘secretary’ from the therapy team to communicate with the family pre-therapy; Communications between the therapist, team and family through earbugs and telephones; Structuring sessions and feedback from the team through breaks and reflecting team discussions; Videotaping therapy sessions; Consultations to the wider system before and during therapy; Use of reading seminars to develop team thinking. 
<br>Systemic family therapy techniques were more varied, with nineteen classifications including circular questioning, externalizing the problem, tracking life events and paying attention to language used.
<br><br><br>
<br>The categories were simplified for the purposes of a coding system, and the final categories were grouped into four sections: 

<br>Therapist’s intention – the intervention that the therapist was observed to be attempting to implement, for example, reframing.
<br>Family trigger event – the immediate actions of a family member before the therapist event, for example, talking about the problem.
<br>Therapist techniques – the type of therapist event, for example, the use of a statement or circular question.
<br>Content of the discussion – the overall theme of the therapist and family interaction for each therapist speech act, for example, talking about solutions. 


<br><br>
<br>Findings showed that therapists used different types of technique according to the kind of intervention they were intending to achieve. 
<br>The technique which therapists used most frequenrly was asking linear questions, though they often used these in a circular fashion, moving around the family to vuild up a picture of events from everyone's persepctive. More complex intentions were associated with <a data-href="Circular Questioning" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/circular-questioning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Circular Questioning</a>, and statements were used to clearly distinguish team and therapists' ideas.

<br><br>Research is vital in moving the field of family therapy forward, but the myriad of possibilities inherent in working with systems and individuals can overwhelm even the most seasoned researcher. Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research is the best resource to address the day-to-day questions that researchers have as they investigate couples and families, and the best source for learning long-term theory and methodology. The contributors of this volume share their wisdom on a wide variety of topics including validity concerns, measuring interpersonal process and relational change, dyadic data analysis (demonstrated through a sample research study), mixed methods studies, and recruitment and retention. The volume contains one of the most detailed descriptions of data collections and covers interviewing, using questionnaires, and observing brain activity.&nbsp; Also addressed are suggestions to meaningfully reduce cultural bias, to conduct ethical research, and, in the Health Services Research chapter, to examine interventions for clients in various income brackets. A separate, ground-breaking chapter also addresses psychophysiological research in a couple and family therapeutic context. As an added benefit, readers will learn how to become informed consumers of journal articles and studies, how to produce quality, publishable research, and how to write fundable grant proposals. Each chapter provides a clear and detailed guide for students, researchers, and professionals, and as a whole Advanced Methods in Family Therapy Research advances the field by teaching readers how to provide evidence that marriage and family therapy not only relieves symptoms, but also effects behavioral change in all family members.<br><br><br>

Few studies have included information about how other members of the system change in relation to a single individual.

<br>In many contexts, the term 'couple' has replaced 'marriage' because of its emphasis on the bond between family members/individuals. 
<br>This shift in language is important - taking a non-judgmental approach. 
<br>There is a social value implied by the more traditional terms (which privileges marriage).
<br><br>
<br>Use the most inclusive term possible (e.g., family)
<br>With respect to all types of relationships, use the term 'couple' as it broadly encompasses those within a committed relationship (regardless of marital status). 
<br>With respect to persons of various gender identities and sexual orientations, use the term 'partner' rather than gendered language (whenever possible).
<br>While the terms such as spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend may be preferred by clients - intentionally using the term 'partner' may be more inclusive. 
<br>With respect to those we serve, we will refer to them as clients as opposed to patients (whenever possible).
<br><br>
<br>Psychiatrists are physicians whoo specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health and emotional problems. (M.D. needed)
<br>Psychologist study the human mind and behavior. (Masters needed)
<br>Social Workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve problems. (Bachelors degree needed, unless clinical social work which needs a masters level degree)
<br>Counselors assist people with personal, family, educational, mental health, and career decisions and problems. (Masters needed)

<br>A family's patterns of behaviors influences the individual and therefore may need to be a part of the treatment plan. 
<br>In CFT, the unit of treatment isn't just the person - even if only one person is 'the client'; it is the set of relationships in which the person is embedded.
<br>Brief
<br>Solution-focused
<br>Specific with attained therapeutic goals
<br>Designed with attainable therapeutic goals
<br>Designed with the 'end in mind'
<br>MFTs treat a wide range of serious clinical problems including:

<br>Depression
<br>Relationship issues
<br>Anxiety
<br>Biopsychosocial-rooted problems


<br>Research has shown that CFT is as effective or more effective than standard individual treatments for many mental health problems including:

<br>Schizophrenia
<br>Affective Mood Disorder
<br>Substance (Ab)use
<br>Child Conduct Disorder
<br>Anorexia
<br>Autism
<br>Chronic Illness
<br>Couple/Partner Distress


<br><br>
<br>Psychiatry raised concern about scope of practice

<br>Wanted to keep MFTs from diagnosis


<br>Psychology sought amendments to the scope to place restrictions on psychological testing, and some oppose licensure in general. 
<br>Social Work concerned with title restriction

<br>Wanted to call its members MFTs


<br>Counselors (ACA) historically most active opponents

<br>Opposed MFT licensure all together
<br>Labeled the discipline as a subspecialty of counseling


<br><br>
<br>Professionals from many different disciplines may at times utilize family-based interventions, or work from theories or models that are core to the CFT discipline. 
<br>Does that mean they are CFTs?
<br><br>
<br>Profession vs. Practice

<br>AAMFT's response 'It's not our intent to define the standards or the scope of practice of any other discipline - social work or psychology, for example, by saying what services they can perform or what training is need to perform those series. 
<br>"We assume those professions will be diligent in ensuring that their practitioners will only deliver services for which they have had training, and are competent to perform, and that the regulatory boards for those professions will police those who go beyond their competence."

<br>No family style is inherently normal or abnormal. 
<br>Whether organizational patterns are functional or dysfunctional depends largely on their fit with the family's developmental and social demands.
<br>The strength of the system requires clear yet flexible boundaries and subsystems for the ability to shift organizational patterns to accommodate needed change.

<br>1950s

<br>Communication and role theories


<br>1970s

<br>Brief therapy theories


<br><br>
<br>Therapists first encountered families as adversaries. 
<br>Therapists begin to notice that often when a client got better, someone else in the family got worse, almost as though the family needed a symptomatic member. 
<br>Clients improved in the hospital only to get worse when they went home. 
<br><br>
<br>Parents sometimes use their children as a buffer to protect themselves from intimacy/ 

<br>I.e., You're scratching your eyes for your mother so she'll have something to worry about. You're a good boy. Good children sacrifice themselves for their parents. 
<br>I.e., Minuchin: As a father of a child in danger, what you're doing isn't enough. Father: What should I do? Minuchin: I don't know. Ask your son.


<br><br>
<br>Groups dynamics are applicable to family therapy because group life is a complex blend of individual personalities and properties of the group. 
<br>The process/context distinction in group dynamics had a major impact on family therapy. 
<br>Attend to how family members talk as much as to what they say. 
<br>Family members have a long history and a future together. 
<br>Continuity, commitment, and shared distortions all make family therapy different from group therapy. 
<br><br>
<br>Concluded that the real problem wasn't a child's symptoms, but rather the tensions in the family that were the source of those symptoms. 
<br>Tendency to blame the parents, especially mothers (this was an evolutionary misdirection that haunts the field).
<br>We need to understand the family in order to diagnose problems.
<br><br>
<br>Many do not distinguish between couple and family therapy. 
<br>Couples therapy is just family therapy applied to a particular subsystem. 
<br>However, there is a case to be made that couples therapy is a distinct enterprise (see Gurman texts)
<br><br>
<br>For many years, therapists resisted the idea of seeing clients' families in order to safeguard the privacy of the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Converging developments in the 1950s led to a new view that the family was an organic whole. 
<br>What they observed was that the behavior of schizophrenia fit with their families; what they concluded was that the family was the cause of schizophrenia. 
<br><br>
<br>Champions of family therapy challenged the assumption that schizophrenia was a biological disease. Psychological healers everywhere cheered. Unfortunately, we were wrong. 
<br>The observation that schizophrenic behavior seems to fit in some families doesn't mean that families caused schizophrenia. 
<br>Families of schizophrenic members suffered for years from the assumption that they were to blame for their child's psychoses.

<br><br>
<br>What shows up as one individual's behavior may be a product of the relationship. 
<br>Family therapists use concepts to describe how people in a relationship contribute to what goes on between them (e.g., pursuer/distancer; overfunctioning/underfunctioning)
<br>At the core, the theory is about:

<br>Structure
<br>Functioning


<br>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

<br>Relabeling behavior to shift how family members respond to it. 


<br>The goal of therapy shifted from interrupting problematic patterns of interaction to helping clients find new perspective on their lives. 
<br>When they said reality was constructed, they meant socially constructed. 
<br><br>
<br>Interpretations are shaped by our context. 
<br>Interpretation of our experience mediates behavior. 
<br>Social constructionists place more emphasis on the intersubjective influence of language and culture. 
<br>Therapy becomes a process of deconstruction, freeing clients from the tyranny of entrenched beliefs. 
<br><br>
<br>Inherent in most forms of therapy is the idea that before you can solve a problem, you must figure out what is wrong. 
<br>But solution-focused turns this assumption on its head. 
<br>The best way to solve problems is to discover what people do when they are not having the problem. 
<br>Exceptions to a complaint.

<br>Redefining problems not as properties of the individuals who suffer them, but as alien oppressors. 


<br><br>
<br>The focus of therapy has expanded toward the wider context. 

<br>This process started when therapists looked beyond individuals to their families. 
<br>Suddenly unexplained behavior made sense. 


<br>Early on, family therapists focused on behavioral interactions surrounding problems. 

<br>Next, they recognize that those interactions were manifestations of a family's underlying structure. 
<br>Structure became the target of change. 


<br>Later, family structure was seen as the product of multigenerational processes that were governed by belief systems. 

<br>Then, therapists aimed their interventions at those underlying beliefs. 
<br>More recently, it dawned on therapists that those belief systems do not arise in a vacuum


<br>Behavior is shaped by transactions we don't always see.

<br>How did you feel about coming in?
<br>What were your reactions to coming in?


<br>Take a family history. 
<br>Conduct the genogram to diagram the family network. 
<br>Listen for family life cycle transitions. 
<br>Search for strengths and resilience. 
<br>Remain curious and respectful. 
<br>Explore the process of family interaction by asking questions about how family members relate to one another and inviting them to discuss their problems with one another in session. 
<br>What is keeping the family stuck?
<br>Share recommendations for treatment. 
<br><br>
<br>What is maintaining the problem?
<br>Maintain therapeutic alliance. 
<br>Listen to and acknowledge family members' points of view. 
<br>Through empathic understanding, family members feel respected and become open to being challenged. 
<br>When one person is presented as the problem, challenge linearity by asking how others are involved or affected? What role do others play in creating or maintaining the problem? How have they responded to it?
<br>Challenge unhelpful interactions by pointing out patterns that seem to be keeping the family stuck. 
<br>The more you do X, the more they do Y - and the more you do Y, the more they do X. 
<br>Listen to people's feelings. 

<br>Listening is a silent activity, rare in our time, even among therapists. 


<br>Family members are not likely to reconsider their assumptions until they've been heard and understood. 
<br><br>
<br>Help family members deal with one another more effectively in session. 
<br>Take a less active role and encourage family members to interact more with one another. 
<br>Step back and observe. 
<br>When family members address their conflicts directly, they tend to become reactive; anxiety is the enemy of listening - help them listen and manage anxiety. 
<br>Stay calm:

<br>You are not responsible for solving the family's problems. 
<br>Just look for the constraints that are keeping them stuck. 
<br>Be curious. 
<br>Display empathy and respect. 


<br><br>
<br>Review the therapeutic relationship. 
<br>Say goodbye. 
<br>Reinforce progress. 
<br>Review what the family has accomplished. 
<br>Anticipate and plan for upcoming challenges. 

<br>How will you know when things are heading backwards? And what will you do?
<br>How will you know if it is time to come back to therapy?


<br>Check-in with the family following treatment, if possible. 
<br><br>
<br>The presenting problem
<br>Understanding the referral route
<br>Identifying the systemic context 
<br>Stage of family life cycle
<br>Family structure

<br>Substance use/abuse
<br>Domestic violence and sexual abuse
<br>Affairs/infidelity
<br>Cultural context (race, ethnicity, culture, gender identity, sexual orientation, class, disability, etc.)
<br><br>
<br>Explore the presenting problem.
<br>Explore attempts to deal with the problem. 

<br>What have they tried?
<br>What has been helpful?
<br>What hasn't been helpful?
<br>Has anyone who is not present been trying to help or hinder?


<br><br>
<br>Who referred the clients and why?
<br>What are their expectations?
<br>What expectations have they communicated to the family?
<br>Is participation voluntary or mandated?
<br>Who recognized the need for treatment?
<br>What other agencies are or will be involved with the case?
<br><br>
<br>Obtain a clear understanding of the interpersonal context of the problem. 
<br>Who is in the family?
<br>Are there other important figures in the life of the problem who aren't present?
<br>Family of origin, immediate family, extended family, family of choice, etc. 
<br>Are there other agencies involved? What is their input? Does the family see them as helpful?

<br>Remember that family therapy is an approach to people in context.

<br>What is your scope of practice?


<br>Specialist

<br>Do you specialize in particular populations? Or problems?


<br>Most family therapists assume their approach can be applied to any problem. Of course their may be exceptions. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
<br>Systems can be viewed in terms of hierarchy, organization, and subsystems. 
<br>Systems strive toward self-preservation and therefore its members work in service of the system, as well as themselves. 
<br><br>
<br>All behavior makes sense in context. 
<br>No one family member is responsible for the family's distress. 
<br>Family therapists work to see the big picture. 
<br>Even when a client presents with an individual issue (e.g., depression, anxiety), family therapists view it within the larger relational context. 
<br><br>
<br>Share the following assumptions:

<br>A person's lived reality is relationally constructed. 
<br>Personal identity and individual symptomology are related to the social systems in which they are embedded. 
<br>Changing one's language and description of the problem alters how it is experienced. 
<br>Truth can be determined only within relational contexts. 


<br><br>
<br>Systems theory

<br>Systems metaphor
<br>A family is a system, a group of individuals who coordinate meaning and their understanding of the world. 


<br>Social constructionist

<br>Textual metaphor
<br>People narrate their lives to create meaning using the social discourses available to them. 


<br><br>
<br>Skeptical of objective reality.
<br>Reality is constructed. 
<br>Reality is constructed through language. 
<br>Reality is negotiated through relationships. 
<br>Shared meanings coordinate social action. 
<br><br>
<br>Founded upon the logical-positivist assumptions of an external, knowable truth. 
<br>Therapist assumes expert role. 
<br>Therapist is an expert who assumes the primary responsibility for identifying problems and goals, often assumes the role of a teacher or mentor. 
<br>Theory and research are the primary sources of information for identifying problems and diagnosis. 
<br>Therapist uses theory and research to select treatment approaches. 
<br><br>
<br>Humans are essentially good. 
<br>All people naturally tend toward growth and strive for self-actualization. 
<br>Focus on treatment is the subjective, internal world of clients. 
<br>Therapeutic interventions target emotions with the goal of promoting catharsis (release of repressed emotions).
<br>A supportive, nurturing environment promoted therapeutic change. 
<br>Examples such as <a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> and <a data-href="Virginia Satir" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/experiential-family-therapy/satir/key-terms-and-concepts/virginia-satir.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virginia Satir</a>
<br><br>
<br>One cannot communicate; all behavior is a form of communication. 
<br>An individual's behavior and symptoms always make sense in context. 
<br>All behaviors and symptoms serve a purpose within the system, allowing the system to maintain <a data-href="Homeostasis" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/homeostasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homeostasis</a>.
<br>No one individual controls behavior in a system and therefore no one individual can be blamed for problems in the family. 
<br>Problematic behavior emerges from the interactions between members of the system. 
<br>Therapeutic change involves altering the interaction patterns within the system. 
<br><br>
<br>Objective truth can never be fully known because it must always pass through subjective and intersubjective filters. 
<br>The human mind does not have access to an outside reality independent of human interpretation. 
<br>Knowledge and truth are culturally, historically, and relationally bound. 
<br>Personal reality and truth are shaped by language and relationships. 
<br>Language affects how identity is shaped and experienced. 
<br>The identification of the problem is a social process that occurs through language. 
<br>Therapy is a process of co-constructing new realities. 
<br><br>
<br>As therapists become more aware of theories, they learn to skillfully integrate ideas from other approaches in a way that is philosophically congruent with their own approach. 
<br>However, therapists who are 'eclectic' or 'integrative' in a way that is not grounded in a single philosophical set of assumptions will confuse their clients. 
<br>Clients will be confused if each week the client is required to relate differently to the therapist and to assume a different level of participation (i.e., sending contradictory messages).
<br>If the therapist is able to keep the philosophical assumptions consistent throughout therapy, then the therapist can adapt concepts and techniques from other approaches without sending conflicting messages.

<br>Strategic grew out of Gregory Bateson's project on <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a> at the <a data-href="Mental Research Institute (MRI)" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/mental-research-institute-(mri).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mental Research Institute (MRI)</a>.

<br><br>
<br>Strategic Therapy is any type of therapy where the therapist initiates what happens during therapy and designs a particular approach for each problem. 
<br>Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people.
<br><br>
<br>Families often perpetuate problems by their own actions. 
<br>Directives tailored to the needs of a particular family can sometimes bring about sudden and decisive change. 
<br>The exchange of multilayered messages between family members define their relationships. 
<br>Interrupting vicious cycles that occur when attempts to solve problems only make them worse. 
<br>People are always communicating. 
<br>All behavior is communicative. 
<br>One cannot not communicate. 
<br>All messages have report and command functions

<br>Report = Content = information = (What is said)
<br>Command = Process = underlying relationship = How it is said


<br>If no one registers a complaint, there is no problem. 
<br>Patterns (e.g., quiet detachment, volatile engagement) may be dysfunctional for some families and adaptive for others. 
<br>The approach is non-normative and complaint-based. 
<br><br>
<br>Focuses on identifying and interrupting 'ironic processes' which occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep the problem going or make it worse. 
<br>The aim of therapy is simply to resolve the presenting complaint as quickly and efficiently as possible, so clients can get on with life
<br>BSCT makes no attempt to specify what constitutes a functional or dysfunctional family relationship. 
<br>The therapist attends to what clients do, as well as how, they view the problem, themselves, and each other.
<br>Often see family members individually in the context of family therapy, even when the focus of the intervention is a relational complaint. 
<br>The model is called 'Strategic' because the therapist intervenes to interrupt ironic processes deliberately, on the basis of a case-specific plan that sometimes includes counter-intuitive suggestions

<br>Go slow
<br>Engage in behavior they want to eliminate


<br>What matters is the extent to which interaction patterns based on attempted solutions keep a complaint going or make it worse. 
<br>The problems clients bring to therapy persist only if they are maintained by ongoing current behavior of the family. 
<br>If problem-maintaining behavior is appropriately changed or eliminated, the problem will be resolved or vanish, regardless of its nature, origin, or duration. 
<br>How a problem persists is much more relevant to therapy than how the problem originated. 
<br>The persistence of the problem depends mainly on social interaction. 
<br>The behavior of one member of the family is stimulated and shaped by the response of the others. 
<br>How a family goes about trying to solve a problem usually plays a crucial role in perpetuating it. 
<br>Well-intentioned yet ironic solutions break the vicious cycle (<a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loops) that maintain an impasse. 
<br><br>
<br>Families are stuck in a spiraling <a data-href="Positive Feedback" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-feedback.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Feedback</a> loop. 
<br>They make common-sense but ineffective attempts to change responses. 
<br>For example:

<br>When a younger sibling arrives, the older sibling, feeling unloved, starts screaming for attention. The parent punishes him which reinforces his feelings of being unloved, and he continues to throw tantrums.

<br>Rules are changed through reframes. 






<br><br>
<br>Centerpiece of the model
<br>Families encounter many difficulties over the course of their lives, whether a difficulty becomes a problem depends on how fmaily members respond to it. 
<br>Families often make misguided attempts to solve their difficulties and, on finding that the problem persists, apply more of the same attempted solutions. This produces an escalation of the problem, which provokes more of the same, in a vicious cycle. 
<br>What often needs to happen? Reverse the solution!

<br>Structural:

<br>Problems are the result of incongruous hierarchies. 


<br>Functional:

<br>Problems result when people try to protect or control one another covertly, so that their symptoms serve a function for the system.  




<br><br>
<br>Once the presenting problem is resolved, therapy is concluded. 
<br>If a family didn't ask for help with other issues, they aren't targeted. 
<br>The job is simply to get the family moving again.
<br>Help families define clear and reasonable goals so that everyone knows when treatment has been successful. 
<br>In pushing family members to set concrete goals, they are forced to clarify vague dissatisfactions. 
<br>The primary goal is behavior change.
<br><br>
<br>Alter specific patterns of communication that maintain problems.

<br>Changes in behavior alter perceptions (rather than the other way around)


<br>Milan:

<br>Get families to see things differently (through reframing or positive connotation), rather than in getting family members to behave differently. 


<br><br>
<br>Define a resolvable complaint. 

<br>Obtain a very specific behavioral picture of the complaint. 

<br>Who sees it as a problem?
<br>Why is it a problem now?


<br>"What is the problem that brings you here today?" is too vague. 
<br>Inquire about exactly what these complaints mean. 


<br>Identify attempted solutions that maintain the complaint. 

<br>Once the problem had been defined, the therapist tries to determine who has tried to solve it and how. 
<br>The solution is part of the problem.
<br>Prescribe some alternative behavior!
<br>The key is to stop the performance of the problem-maintaining solution. 
<br>MRI Approach:

<br>Introduction to the treatment setup
<br>Inquiry and definition of the problem
<br>Estimation of the behavior maintaining the problem
<br>Setting goals for treatment
<br>Selecting and making behavioral interventions
<br>Termination


<br>Attempted solutions:

<br>The solution is deny that a problem exists; action is necessary but not taken. For instance, parents do nothing necessary despite the growing evidence that their teenage son is using drugs. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve something that isn't really a problem; action is taken when it shouldn't be. For example, parents punish a child for masturbating. 
<br>The solution is an effort to solve a problem within a framework that makes a solution impossible; action is taken but at the wrong level. For instance, a husband buys gifts for his wife when what she wants is affection. 


<br>Solutions that perpetuate problems fall into three categories:

<br>When clients deny that a problem exists (example: anorexia) ACT
<br>When clients try to solve something that really isn't a problem (example: punishing a child for masturbating) STOP ACTING
<br>When clients try to solve a problem within a framework that make a solution impossible (example: husband buys gifts for his wife, rather than giving her the affection she desires) DIFFERENT ACTIONS




<br>Understand the clients' unique language for describing the problem. 
<br><br>
<br>To interrupt problem-maintaining sequences, therapists may try to do something that runs counter to common sense. 
<br>Paradoxical interventions:

<br>The therapist directs the family members to continue their symptomatic behavior. If they conform, they admit control and expose secondary gain. If they rebel, they give up their symptom(s).


<br>Most common symptom prescriptions where the family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. 
<br>Hope is that the family will comply and then be forced to reverse their attempted solution. 
<br>May also hope the client rebels against the therapist's advice. 
<br>Restraining technique:

<br>Warning clients against changing to fast and relapse; reinforced the therapist's one-down position. 


<br><br>
<br>The family is told to continue or embellish the behavior they complain about. 
<br>Sometimes the therapist prescribes the symptom while secretly hoping the clients will rebel against the directive. 
<br>As soon as a family member is overwhelmed, they are instructed to make a list of all the things that they might do to sabotage their life. Doing so can take the rebellion out of self-destructive behavior, thus making it less appealing and less impulsive. 
<br><br>
<br>Asking a couple to deliberately have an argument during the week in order to help the therapist understand how they get involved in such no-win encounters and how they are able to get each other to act unreasonably. 
<br>Discouraging families from trying to change too fast, warning them to go slow and worrying out loud about the possibility of relapse when improvements do occur. 
<br>Perhaps you should continue to wake Ricky up for school, after all, you don't want to push him to be too responsible too soon. 
<br>The main thing is to discover what families are doing to perpetuate the problem and then get them to do something different.

<br>Hayley was particularly concerned with power struggles, and often prescribed the symptom such that the cost of keeping it up outweighed the gains.

<br>Idea that one event does not 'cause' another but that events are interconnected and there are multiple factors behind a behavior. 


<br><br>
<br>To resolve, remove, or ameliorate the problem the family agreed to work on. 
<br>Behavioral, concerned with the immediate problem, and anti-insight. 
<br>Structural re-organization of the family, like the structural therapies, but with sub-goals to deal with the presenting problem. 
<br>Process, not content-focused.
<br>Emphasize short term treatment (10 sessions)
<br><br>
<br>Define a problem clearly
<br>Investigating all solutions that have previously been tried
<br>Defining a clear and concrete change to be achieved
<br>Formulating and implementing a strategy for change
<br><br>
<br>Therapists must be innovative
<br>Therapy must be customizable to families (technique driven)
<br>If families are going to change, alterations in ways their members act must precede new perceptions or feelings
<br>Focus on interpersonal payoff of psychiatric symptoms
<br><br>
<br>Social Stage:

<br>Introduction and setup
<br>Help everyone relax, greet each family member, make sure everyone is comfortable. 


<br>Problem Stage:

<br>Definition of the problem in clear behavioral terms
<br>Ask each individual for their perspective, speak to the less involved parent/partner first to get their involvement, listen carefully to the way each family member describes the problem, make sure no one interrupts until each has a turn, make observations. 
<br>Emphasize the use of directives.
<br>If therapy is to end well, it must begin proper. 


<br>Interaction Stage:

<br>Estimation of the behaviors maintaining the problem
<br>Encourage family members to discuss their points of view among themselves, observe rather than just hearing about the interchanges that surround the problem, look for coalitions between family members against others, how functional is the hierarchy and do family members work together as a team or undercut one another?


<br>Goal Setting Stage

<br>Providing directives
<br>Give the family a task, directives


<br><br>
<br>Offering a different perspective/framework to understand problem behavior. 
<br>"The use of language to give a new meaning to a situation."

<br>For instance, a child's misbehavior can be reframed as his way of asking for attention, not an indication of disrespect. 


<br>Reframes can be offered by asking circular questions:

<br>"Who makes you depressed?"
<br>"What does dad do when you and mom are fighting?"


<br>Changing the frame of reference for understanding behavior leads to change in the rules governing interactions which in turn leads to sustainable change. 
<br><br>
<br>Where a symptom is often seen as a metaphor for an underlying problem. 

<br>Example:

<br>A school problem in a child may mirror a work problem in a parent.

<br>Families should have clear generational boundaries.

<br>Engage families in a series of actions that ran counter to or exaggerated rigid family rules. 


<br><br>
<br>Define the complaint in specific behavioral terms. 
<br>Set minimum goals for change. 
<br>Investigate solutions to the complaints. 
<br>Concentrate on the 'less of the same.'
<br>Understand clients' preferred views. 
<br>Use these views to suggest 'less of the same'
<br>Nurture and solidify initial change. 
<br><br>
<br>Frequency of sessions intended to maximize the likelihood that change will be durable. 
<br>Typically patter of brief (e.g., weekly, tapering off)
<br>Therapy ends when the treatment goals have been attained (and change seems reasonably stably?)
<br>Co-therapists work as a team (e.g., observing behind the mirror, leaving the room to consult)
<br>Late in session, the therapist may leave so the team can help the therapist plan a homework assignment or framing intervention. 
<br><br>
<br>The essential role of the therapist is to persuade the family to 'do less of the same' solution that keeps the complaint going. 
<br>Treatment is likely to go awry if the therapist is not in control of it. 
<br>Good strategic therapists rarely exert control directly in the sense of offering authoritative prescriptions or assuming the role of an expert. 
<br>Taking a 'one down position' and a stance of empathetic curiosity. 

<br>I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so could you help me understand again what it is you do when he raises his voice that way?
<br>I don't know if doing this when he walks through the door will make much of a difference, but if you could try it once or twice this week, at least we'll have an idea what we're up against. 


<br>Emapthetic restraint (e.g., go slow) is used to neutralize apprehension and resistance to change. 
<br>When clients fail to follow a suggestion, a common response is for the therapist to take the blame (e.g., I think I suggested that prematurely) and seek alternative routes to the same strategic objective. 
<br>While the model does not emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship, this does not mean that strategic therapists come across as cold, manipulative, or uncaring. On the contrary, many receive high ratings on rapport and alliance. 
<br><br>
<br>Define a resolvable complaint. 
<br>Identify solution patterns (problem-solution loops) that maintain the complaint. 
<br>Understand clients' unique language and preferred views of the problem, themselves and each other. 
<br>
<br>The first two goals provide a template for where to intervene and the third goal is relevant to how to intervene. 
<br><br>
<br>Gather a specific behavioral picture of the complaint

<br>Who is doing what?
<br>If I had a video of this, what would I see?


<br>Assess who sees the complaint as a problem and why it is a problem now?
<br>Determine a minimum change goal

<br>What would you be doing, or the two/three/four of you be doing differently that will let you know this problem is taking a turn for the better. 


<br>Inquire into behaviors that are closely related to the problem:

<br>What has the family is done to handle, prevent, or resolve the complaint?
<br>What happens after these attempted solutions?


<br>Develop a picture of what 'less of the same' will look like:

<br>What behavior, by whom, in what situation, will suffice to reverse the problem-maintaining solution?


<br><br>
<br>The key element to stopping the performance of the attempted solution, so as not to perpetuate 'more of the same' problem-maintaining solution. 
<br>The final assessment goal is grasping the clients' unique views. This is crucial to the later task of framing suggestions:

<br>How do they see themselves and want to be seen by others?
<br>What do they hold near and dear?
<br>When are they at their best, and what do others notice about those times?
<br>What is their best guess about why a particular problem is happening - and why they handle it the way they do?
<br>Whose idea was it to come? Why now?
<br>Who is most optimistic that therapy will help?


<br><br>
<br>How will you know the situation is improving?
<br>What kinds of change will you settle for?
<br>What will need to happen (or not to happen) to let you know that, even if you are not out of the woods entirely, you're at least on the right path?
<br>What will each of you settle for?
<br><br>
<br>Therapeutic restraint:

<br>Telling clients to 'go slow'
<br>Cautioning them about the dangers of improvement
<br>Giving insturctions about how to make the problem worse


<br>Go slow is used to prepare clients for change, to convey acceptance of reluctance to change, and to solidify change once it begins to occur. 
<br>Asking the family to collaborate in performing the problem patterns (e.g., an argument) deliberately. 
<br>Identify problem-solution feedback loops:

<br>Demand-Refuse
<br>Discuss-Acoid
<br>Criticize-Defend
<br>Accuse-Deny


<br>Encourage the family to do less of the same:

<br>When members felt the need to talk about their relationship, they would first go bowling. 


<br><a data-href="Reframing" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/reframing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reframing</a>:

<br>For a small set of family complaints, the goal is to help families reevaluate their problem as 'no problem,' or as a problem they can live with. 


<br>Acknowledging (Reinforcing):

<br>When a small change occurs, the therapist acknowledges and emphasizes the clients' part in making it happen, but avoids encouraging further change directly. 


<br>Predicting or Prescribing:

<br>Exploring the dangers of movement. 


<br>Therapeutic restraint / going slow
<br>Prescribing the symptom / performing the problem / predicting
<br>Jamming / experiment
<br>Reframing
<br>Less of the same
<br>Acknowledge / reinforce
<br><br>
<br>Critics sometimes regard strategic therapy as 'manipulative' because the therapist does not usually make the rationale for particular interventions explicit to clients. 
<br>The therapist may say things that they do not truly believe to achieve an effective framing. 
<br>Proponents counter that responsible therapy is inherently manipulative and that therapeutic candor can be disrespectful. Good therapy shows profound respect for clients' subjective experiences. 
<br>Critics suggest strategic therapists may ignore problems such as intimate-partner violence or substance abuse, if clients do not perceive or present them as overt complaints in session. 
<br>The model does not attempt at helping families with personal growth or solving underlying emotional issues. 
<br><br>
<br>The central curative factor is interruption of 'ironic processes' which depends on:

<br>Accurate identification of the particular solution efforts that maintain or exacerbate the problem. 
<br>Specifying what less of those same solution behaviors might look like. 
<br>Designing one intervention that will persuade at least one of the people involved to do less or the opposite of what they have been doing. 


<br><br>
<br>Applicable to any family that presents with a clear complaint. 
<br>Particularly relevant for families that seem resistance to change. 
<br>Most qualitative research (case reports) and follow-up quantitative data. 
<br><br>
<br>Historically, most of the research on the effectiveness of Strategic Therapy wasn't very rigorous. 
<br>Mostly case report format. 
<br>Anecdotal support for its efficacy, although people tend not to write about their failed cases.

<br>A family is functional to the degree that it nurtures its members to negotiate well the demands of the outside world. 
<br>Boundaries set limits distinguishing subsystems from one another in varying permeability (from diffuse to rigid).

<br>The family could have developed a structure different from the dysfunctional one now being displayed. 
<br>The family processes adaptive resources in its relational repertoire that currently lie dormant.

<br><br>
<br>Offers a framework that brings order and meaning to family transactions. 
<br>The consistent patterns of family behavior reveal family structure. 
<br>The emotional boundaries and coalitions that make up a family's structure are abstractions. 
<br>The concept of family structure enables therapists to intervene in a systematic and organized way. 
<br>Families seek help for a specific problem. 
<br>Family therapists look beyond the specifics of those problems to the family's attempts to solve them. 
<br>Exploring dynamics of interaction. 
<br>Recognizing the overall organization of the family regulates those interactions. 
<br>The model attends to subsystems and boundaries that regular contact between members. 
<br>The model emphasizes enactments wherein family members are encouraged to deal directly with one another in session, permitting the therapist to observe and modify their interactions. 
<br>Structural family therapy provides therapists with a blueprint for how to view patterns of family dynamics. 

<br>The three major concepts of structural family therapy are <a data-href="Structure" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Structure</a>, <a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a>, and <a data-href="Subsystem" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/subsystem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Subsystem</a>s.

<br><br>
<br>Problems are symptomatic of the family's inability to be flexible and accommodating of changing needs. 
<br>All family behavior, even destructive behavior, has the goal of balancing the system to ensure its survival. 
<br>Family problems do not result from stresses in the system but from the effects of reactions and responses to the stresses. 
<br><br>
<br>Structure is:

<br>The way a family is organized into subsystems whose interactions are regulated by interpersonal boundaries. 
<br>The organized pattern in which families interact


<br>Patterns are formed based on rules that are implicit or explicit. 
<br>Over time, as patterns develop, roles for family members are established. 
<br>Patterns are isomorphic (i.e., interaction patterns are repeated in different relationships in a system).
<br>The focus of treatment is on changing the family structure rather than changing individual family members. 
<br>The process of family interaction is like the patterns of conversation at the dinner table. The structure of the family is where family members sit in relation to one another. 
<br>As family transactions are repeated, they foster expectations that establish enduring patterns. 
<br>Family structure is reinforced by the expectations that establish rules in a family. 
<br><br>
<br>Families are differentiated into subsystems based on generation, gender, or function. 
<br>Adults are the 'organizational leaders' of the family system so whatever is present in the adult subsystem relationship will be felt throughout the whole system. 
<br>Children are common 'symptom bearers'
<br>Organization is most healthy when there are 3 clearly defined systems:

<br>Marital/Couple
<br>Parental
<br>Child/Sibling


<br><br>
<br>Each subsystem is demarcated by interpersonal boundaries. 
<br>Boundaries range from rigid to diffuse. 
<br>Defined as rules for managing physical and psychological distance between family members and for defining regulation of closeness, hierarchy, and family roles. 
<br><br>
<br>Rigid boundaries are restrictive and permit little contact with outside subsystems, resulting in disengagement.
<br>Disengaged systems are independent, but isolated. 
<br>On the plus side, this fosters autonomy. 
<br>But limits affection and support. 
<br><br>
<br>Diffuse boundaries result in enmeshment.
<br>Enmeshed systems offer closeness, but at the expense of independence. 
<br>Too much closeness can cripple initiative. 
<br><br>
<br>Determines who (or which subsystem) has power in the system. 
<br>Any structure in a family is not static, it is developed over time. 
<br>Hierarchies can be rigid and unfair or weak and ineffective. 
<br>Be aware of cross-generational coalitions. 
<br><br>
<br>Accommodation requires the family system to be flexible and alert to changing needs of individuals in the family. 
<br>Boundary making refers to the demarcation of subsystems as they are formed. 
<br><br>
<br>In accommodating to each other, a couple must establish a boundary between them, as well as a boundary separating them from the outside. 
<br>The addition of children transform the structure of a family into a parental subsystem and child subsystem. 
<br>Even in healthy families, children often bring stress and conflict. Children require different styles of parenting at different ages. 
<br>Minuchin warned therapists not to mistake growing pains for pathology. 
<br>What distinguishes healthy families isn't the absence of problems, but a functional structure for dealing with them. 
<br><br>"The problem behavior is a symptom of the dysfunctional structure of the family system."<br>
<br>Disengaged or enmeshed subsystems
<br>Hierarchies are weak and ineffective; or rigid &amp; arbitrary
<br>Conflict avoidance

<br>Detouring which results in a scapegoat
<br>Cross-generational coalition (where hierarchy may be inverted)


<br>
<br>Modifications in structure are required when a family or one of its members encounters external pressure (a parent is laid off) or a developmental transition occurs (e.g., parents retire). 
<br>Healthy families accommodate to their changed circumstances, dysfunctional families increase the rigidity of structures that no longer work (e.g., strict parenting tightening up further when a child acts out and needs nurturance).
<br>Families are susceptible to develop a dysfunctional structure during periods of:

<br>Normative life cycle transition

<br>The arrival of a first child
<br>An adult child leaving home


<br>An acute stressor

<br>Natural Disaster
<br>Unemployment




<br><br>
<br>Single Adult
<br>Coupling
<br>Having Children
<br>Families with Young Children
<br>Families with School-Age Children
<br>Families with Adolescents
<br>Divorce
<br>Blended Families
<br>Launching Children
<br>Later Life
<br><br>
<br>Early on the model shifted from why family members interact the way they do, and the past, to how they learned to act that way. 
<br>Now, the model considers not only how family members interact, but also how and why they learned to do so. 
<br>All behavior makes sense in context. 
<br>The mechanism of change is the production of new relational experiences for families. 
<br>Families change each other by behaving differently toward each other. 
<br><a data-href="Enactment" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enactment.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enactment</a> refers to those moments in therapy when family members interact directly with each other.

It typically occurs naturally in session. It is the 'here-and-now' of the therapy session.

<br>Alter the organization of a family so that its members can solve their own problems. 
<br>The goal is structural change; problem-solving is a by-product.
<br>Problems are embedded in dysfunctional structures.
<br>Activate adaptive patterns that are already in families repertoires. 
<br>Create effective hierarchy:

<br>Parents should be in charge, not relate to their children as equals. 
<br>Differentiate individuals and subsystems by strengthening the boundaries around them. 
<br>Increase contact by making boundaries more permeable. 


<br><br>
<br>The therapist produces change by joining the family, probing for areas of flexibility, and then activating formant structural alternatives. 
<br>Joining conveys acceptance of family members and respect for their ways of doing things. 
<br>Only after joining can the therapist attempt restructuring. 
<br>Understand the family's view of their problems by tracking their perspectives (words they use to explain problems and the behavior with which they demonstrate them).

<br>Take-Away:

<br>Observe and modify the structure of family transactions in the immediate context of the session.


<br><br>
<br>The therapist manages the nuts-and-bolts details of how the therapy process is structured including:

<br>Who should attend
<br>How often
<br>Referrals for psychiatric evaluation


<br>Therapy aims to change how family members experience each other. 
<br>Family members are expected to be present together for sessions. 
<br>Relational experiences can 'wash out' between sessions, therefore, therapy usually starts out weekly. 
<br><br>
<br>Join the family accommodate to its members' style (building alliance)
<br>Map the family structure, boundaries, and hierarchy (evaluating and assessing structure)
<br>Intervene to transform the structure to diminish symptoms (addressing the problems identified in the assessment)
<br><br>
<br>Observe and assess how family members respond to their dilemmas. 
<br>Because problems are a function of the entire family structure, it's important to include the whole group for assessment. 
<br>Some problems may be treated individually. 
<br>Problems can persist in individuals, in the social context, or the feedback between them. 
<br>Individual problems need to be identified and appropriate. 
<br>Structural therapists prefer to begin therapy with the entire family, but they do not insist on it. 
<br>Once the family has been assessed, the therapist often meets with specific subsystems and individuals to achieve structured goals.

<br>Strengths
<br><br>
<br>Ask questions about the presenting problem until family members begin to see that the problem goes beyond the symptom bearer to include the entire family. 
<br>Assist family members in seeing how their interactions may be perpetuating the presenting problem. 
<br>Briefly explore the past, focusing on how the adults in the family came to develop the perspectives that influence their interactions. 
<br>Explore options that family members might take to interact in more productive ways to create a shift in the family structure and help resolve the presenting problem. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Greet the family
<br>Ask for each person's view of the problem
<br>Listen carefully
<br>Acknowledge what you hear
<br>Model empathy that family members are temporarily not able to provide
<br>Acknowledgement (feeling heard and understood) releases family members from resentment
<br>Joining opens the way for family members to begin listening to one another and establishes a bond with the therapist that enables them to accept the challenges to come. 
<br>Intervention Language:

<br>Joined with the Family
<br>Engaged in Reflective Listening
<br>Built Rapport
<br>Acknowledged
<br>Reflected
<br>Summarized
<br>Validated
<br>Elicited
<br>Emphasized
<br>Challenged
<br>Reinforced


<br>Maintain an outsider perspective to remain objective, while becoming familiar with family's experiential reality. 
<br>Unless therapist is allowed to become part of the new system, no change will take place. 
<br>Respect the family, and its individual members, despite presenting problem (i.e., abuse)
<br>The therapist joins the system in the sense that they accommodate to its style; how people talk, what words they use, how they walk, and so forth. 
<br>Make contact with each member of the family

<br>Greeting, shaking hands (pre-COVID)
<br>Using names
<br>Noticing something unique about each of the members
<br>Find something similar about each person and then allow the family members to recognize the similarity


<br><br>
<br>Skills involved in joining:

<br>Accommodating:

<br>Matching the family's style of language with gestures or subject matter (being 'familiar' to the family) 
<br>Being interested in the family's interests (i.e., baseball). 


<br>Validating:

<br>Validate the worth of each family member. 


<br>Searching for Competencies:

<br>Therapist enhances self-esteem by discovering and validating competencies.

<br><br>
<br>Assume authority for the structure of therapy. 
<br>Maintain control so things do not go awry. 
<br>Lead by following. 

<br>Be able to interrupt.
<br>Make demands, rather than polite, requests.


<br>Inviting the family to schedule the next session. 
<br>Validating ambivalence about coming again.

<br>Attending to process = accommodation when the therapist responds to the underlying affect in the manner in which the statement is made. 
<br>Process comments are better when kept general. 
<br><br>
<br>The therapist notices a problematic sequence (a hunch).
<br>The therapist initiates an enactment (talk this over with your partner).

<br><br>
<br>Assess interactions in session. 
<br>Families tend to quickly induct therapists in their culture. 
<br>Take into account both the problem the family presents and the structural dynamics it displays. 
<br><br>
<br>Once families begin to interact, problematic transactions emerge. 
<br>Recognizing structure requires focusing on process, not content. 
<br>Achieve intensity by selective regulation of affect, repetition, and duration. Tone, volume, pacing, and choice of words can be used to raise the affective intensity of interventions.

<br>Assist dyads in finishing conversations without intrusion. 
<br>Although structural family therapy begins with the whole family, subsequent sessions may be held with individuals or subgroups to strengthen boundaries. 
<br>Asking family members to change seats. 
<br>Asking family members to move seats further apart or closer together or turn toward one another. 
<br>Having separate sessions with individuals or subsystems to strengthen boundaries. 
<br>Asking one or more members to remain silent during an interaction. 
<br>Asking questions that highlight a problem boundary area (e.g., do you always answer for your son when he is asked a question?)
<br>Blocking interruptions or encouraging pauses to enable less dominant persons to speak. 
<br><br>
<br>The goal in unbalancing is to change the relationship within the subsystem. 
<br>The therapist joins and supports one individual or subsystem. 
<br>While taking sides seems like a violation of neutrality, this is done to unbalance and realign the system (note that fairness is achieved because the therapist sides with family members in turn).

<br><br>
<br>The therapist sometimes challenges the way clients see things. 
<br>Act as a teacher, offering information and advice, often about structural matters. 
<br>Stroke and a Kick:

<br>To mother, "You are very helpful." (Stroke)
<br>To daughter, "Mommy sometimes takes away your voice. Can you speak for yourself?" (Kick)


<br><br>
<br>After the family's view of the problem has been enlarged by process comments and family is familiar with therapeutic process. 
<br>Therapist can present the family with a different perspective of the problem that allows them to activate new behaviors (in a new situation)
<br>To formulate a reframe the therapist brings together the verbal and nonverbal messages. 
<br>Should take into account every member. 
<br>Should like the family problem with the rules of the structure. 
<br>Should not be explained to the family. 
<br>As family members describe their problems, therapists reflect on their understanding systemic reframing, which takes into account all behavior as reciprocal. 
<br>Use family's language. 
<br>Use family's content. 
<br>Include everyone. 
<br>Ensure the reframe has a nonjudgemental, non-blaming focus, and better still, has positive connotations. 
<br>Be prepared to restate the reframe in several different ways. 
<br>Avoid intrapsychic interpretations and why-because aspects in forming the reframe. 
<br>Realize that there is no perfect reframe. 
<br><br>
<br>Structural mapping is used as an assessment tool for understanding interaction patterns. 
<br><br>
<br>Blocking:

<br>Stopping usual transactions. 


<br>Exaggerating:

<br>Encouraging or sustaining interactions. 


<br>Silence:

<br>When a response is expected, doing the unusual by not giving one - thus demanding the family to act. 


<br>All unbalancing, if successful, will heighten tension and intensity to fuel family to move toward change. 
<br>Actively shift the focus of the family from solving the presenting problem to changing the family structure. The therapist must unbalance the family's old patterns. 
<br><br>
<br>The model directs therapists to look beyond the content of problems and even beyond the dynamics of interaction to the underlying family organization that supports and contains those interactions. 
<br>The most important tenet in that every family has a structure, and this structure is revealed only when the family is in action. 
<br><br>
<br>Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. 
<br>Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. 
<br>More recent, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD)
<br><br>
<br>Treatment is concerned only with the relief of the family's suffering. 
<br>Interventions are limited to relief of suffering, thus treatment may be brief (&lt;6 sessions)
<br><br>
<br>Therapist must be more flexible than the family. 
<br>Focused on change not insight (how not why of dysfunction). 
<br>Therapist should be in charge of all communications and coordination with collaborators. 
<br><br>
<br>The self of the therapist is one of the primary tools for facilitating change. 
<br>Therapists must use themselves to relate to the family, varying from being highly involved to professionally detached (depending on the family's needs).

<br><br>

<br>What are your personal strengths? What are your growth areas?
<br><br>
<br>Strongest empirical support comes from a series of studies on children with psychosomatic symptoms and young adults addicted to drugs. 
<br>Early structural family therapy studies demonstrated effectiveness in treating disruptive behavior and adolescent substance use. 
<br>More recently, studies have shown that structural family therapy can be effective when addressing problem behavior spanning the externalizing spectrum (e.g., disruptive behavior, adolescent substance use, conduct disorder, ADHD).
<br><br>
<br>Similar to all family therapy approaches, structural family therapy is not effective in all cases. 
<br>No research identifies readily observable characteristics shared by failed cases of structural family therapy. 
<br>Developed to work with poor urban families, at all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and across countries. 
<br>Indirect empirical support, as research on efficacy has focused on applicability to family treatment. 
<br>Studies that directly test structural family therapy's efficacy in the treatment of various presenting problems and targeted populations are needed. 
<br><br>
<br>Efficacy 'refers to treatment effects observed in randomized controlled trials.'
<br>Effectiveness 'refers to treatment effects in routine practice.'
<br>Currently, the evidence does not show that any of the demonstrably efficacious approaches to family therapy are more effective than other approaches, largely because there is a dearth of evidence on the efficacy of many widely used family therapy approaches.
<br><br>
<br>Family therapy research has had little impact on the day-to-day practice of family therapists. 
<br>The disconnection between research and practice is alarming. 
<br>This may be attributed to, 'An overemphasis by researchers.. On treatment packages and therapeutic models/techniques.'
<br>Insufficient attention has been paid to sources of influence on treatment outcomes (the skills of the the therapist themselves)
<br>Effective family therapy requires a good 'fit' between the person of the therapist and their primary theoretical orientation. 
<br>Family therapy is shifting to research that addresses the process aspects of the therapeutic models. 
<br><br>
<br>It is important to remember there are multiple ways of knowing what works:

<br>Randomized control trials
<br>Case studies data
<br>Observations of therapists and clients

<br>Collecting qualitative or quantitative




<br>Remember:

<br>Research lags behind practice in family therapy. 
<br>Just because a model has been tested doesn't inherently mean it is superior. 


<br><br>
<br>Heteronormative
<br>Pathologizing (seeing problems are embedded in dysfunctional family structures)
<br>Family mapping implies pathology resides in family structure, but this is not true. Problems are viewed as a failure to adjust to changing circumstances.

<br>Thoughts and perceptions
<br>Acting or behaving
<br>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. 
<br>Problems are based in unhelpful thinking and behavior. 
<br>Families can learn better ways of coping, which improves symptoms. 
<br><br>
<br>Behavior is maintained by its consequences.
<br>Consequences that increase behavior are reinforcers. 
<br>Consequences that decrease behavior are punishers.
<br><br>
<br>Behavior is regulated by its consequences. 
<br>Responses that are positively reinforced will increase. 
<br>Responses that are punished or ignored will be extinguished. 
<br>CBT/CBFT is a highly efficacious intervention to assist families in a variety of contexts (this model has empirical support)
<br>CBT has focused on family's cognitive processing and behavioral interactions, while minimizing the influences of individual differences between family members. 
<br>CBT also addresses characteristics that each family member brings to their relationships, explaining why family members behave and interpret events in maladaptive ways. 
<br><br>
<br>Scarcity of positive outcomes available for each family member. 
<br>Deficits in communication and problem solving. 
<br>High frequency of negative or punishing exchanges reciprocated by partners, parents, family members. 
<br>Family members are more likely to track negative behavior selectively and to make negative attributions for such behavior. 
<br>They reciprocate negative behavior with negative behavior. 
<br>Primary distress results from unmet fundamental needs create secondary distress (withdrawal or verbally abuse among family members)
<br><br>
<br>Behavior is maintained by its consequences. 
<br>Ratio of costs and benefits to behavior (something is maintianing it)
<br>Good relationships are under positive reinforcement ocntrol
<br><br>
<br>CBT recognizes the influence of both the family's behavioral interactions (processes) and the major themes (content) that serve as the basis for relationship discord. 
<br><br>
<br>Thoughts change to promote behavioral change (thoughts -&gt; behavior)
<br>Emotions and actions are mediated by cognitions (thoughts -&gt; emotions)
<br>Understand cognition (beliefs, attributions, expectancies) makes it possible to identify triggers to behavioral patterns.
<br>Uncovering hidden/automatic assumptions that keep people stuck. 
<br><br>
<br>Overgeneralizations
<br>Magnification and minimization
<br>Personalization
<br>Dichotomous thinking
<br>Labeling and mislabeling
<br>Also called black and white thinking, catastrophizing, defense mechanisms
<br><br>
<br>Help families become more active observers and evaluators of their own automatic thoughts, long-standing assumptions, and of their relationship standards.
<br><br>
<br>Individual family members vary in the extent to which they have a clear understanding of the factors affecting their relationships and clear goals for treatment and how their own contributions affect the achievement of their goals. 
<br>Therapist determines the appropriate sequence of addressing goals in therapy. 
<br>Extinguish undesired behavior and reinforce positive alternatives. 

<br>Ignoring the tantrum; rewarding the child for putting feelings into words


<br>Redefine the family's goals of decreasing negative behavior into increasing positive responses. 
<br>Families have difficulty describing the behavior they want to see more of
<br>The therapist helps by asking families to make a list of things the other person did that they liked throughout the week. 
<br>Reviewing the list in session the next week provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of positive feedback. 
<br>This agenda of therapy is educational:

<br>Teach communication, problem-solving, and negotiation


<br><br>
<br>Behavior will change when the contingencies of reinforcement are altered. 
<br>Identify behavioral goals
<br>Learn techniques to achieve these goals
<br>Facilitate social reinforcement of change
<br><br>
<br>Brief (about 20 weekly sessions)
<br>Use of homework assignments
<br>Phase out therapy gradually. 

<br>Once the family shows evidence of substituting positive interactions for negative ones and goals are achieved. 


<br>Booster sessions
<br><br>
<br>Collaborate with families in designing homework to complete between sessions. 
<br>Homework is based on the learning principle that to replace existing ingrained dysfunctional interactional patterns with new ones, families rehearse the new patterns repeatedly, particularly under 'real life conditions.'
<br><br>
<br>CBFT has been popular in two primary sub-systems:
<br><br>
<br>All couples run into conflict. 
<br>Conflict resolution is a critical skill. 
<br>Healthy families are not problem free, but they can resolve conflicts when they arise. 
<br>They describe their own feelings and request changes in the behavior of others rather than criticizing or complaining. 
<br><br>
<br>Good relationships are not made in heaven, they are a product of learning effective coping behavior. 
<br>Families need problem solving skills  
<br>Therapy includes:

<br>Clinical interview
<br>Rating specific behaviors
<br>Relationship satisfaction questionnaires


<br><br>
<br>Couples are taught to express themselves in clear, behavioral descriptions, rather than in vague complaints. 
<br>Couples are taught new behavior exchange procedures, emphasizing positive reinforcement. 
<br>Couples are helped to improve their communication. 
<br>Couples are encouraged to establish clear and effective decision-making. 
<br>Couples are taught strategies to problem-solve future complaints to extend the benefits of therapy. 

<br>Ask each partner to list three things they would like the other to do more often.

<br>Identifying Automatic Thoughts

<br>Assist family members in identifying automatic thoughts
<br>To improve the skills of identifying automatic thoughts, clients are encouraged to keep a diary to jot down situations that provoke the thoughts and the resulting emotional reactions. 


<br><br>
<br>Joining with all members of the family simultaneously can be challenging. 
<br>Families in conflict often desire to form an alliance with the therapist, each family member trying to convince the therapist that the other members are responsible for relationship problems. 
<br>Do not be triangulated!
<br><br>
<br>CBFT therapists hear the seriousness of the concerns while not siding with individual family members. 
<br>CBFT therapists use empathic reflective listening with one family member and then the other, followed by statements summarizing the reciprocal interwoven concerns of all members. 
<br>CBFT therapists are a neutral party whose agenda is to help family members achieve their personal goals for family relationships. 
<br>CBFT therapists often define relationship problems in 'dyadic terms.'
<br>Blocking (e.g., interrupting) if necessary
<br><br>
<br>Inclusion of other individuals if necessary
<br>Medication, and individual therapy can be used in conjunction with CBFT
<br>Co-therapy model is allowed
<br>Both individual and conjoint sessions are allowed. 
<br>Clients may be more likely to divulge information about their past in private sessions. 
<br>CBFT therapists tell clients they will keep this information confidential, but if it might be influencing the family's current interactions, they encourage the person to share it in a joint session
<br>Secrets
<br>Be up front with clients about the limits of confidentiality

<br>Assist them with sharing in a joint session (rather than outing them)

<br><br>
<br>Miracle question
<br>Rating/Scaling (1 to 10)
<br>Break
<br>After intermission, the therapist will give the client/family compliments, sometimes followed by a suggestion or homework. 
<br><br>
<br>If it ain't broken, don't fix it. 
<br>Once you know what works, do more of it. 
<br>If it doesn't work, don't do it again, do something different. 
<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused family therapy begins with clients' descriptions of how they want their lives to be different. 
<br>It can be understood as beginning with the end of the story, rather than the beginning of the problem. 
<br>The basic idea is to avoid escalating problem talk by instead focus on eliciting movement in a helpful direction (i.e., focusing on solutions).
<br>Focus is on solutions, on what works for clients. 
<br>Respect clients own resources. 
<br>Directed toward building solutions rather than increasing insight into punitive maladaptive psychological mechanisms. 
<br>Future-oriented
<br>Focusing on those times when the problem was not present (exceptions).
<br>The task of therapy is to do something different. 
<br>What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?
<br><br>
<br>The most fundamental difference between the emphasis between problem-focused therapy and solution-focused therapy is the emphasis each give to the concept of 'solution.'
<br>Solution-focused family therapy seeks to identify exceptions to the problem and develop new solutions that work. 

<br>What brings you in?
<br>What are your best hopes for this meeting?


<br>Therapists avoid diagnostic categories and preconceived notions of what may be healthy or unhealthy. 
<br>Accept the client's version of what is, and what is not, the problem. 
<br>It isn't necessary to know what causes problems in order to make things better. 
<br>Families that come to therapy are capable of behaving effectively, but their effectiveness has been blunted by a negative mind-set. 
<br>The model draws attention to forgotten capabilities, which release families from preoccupation with their failures and restores them to their capable selves. 
<br>Problems are seen as overwhelming because families see them as always happening, times when problems are not happening, aren't noticed, or are dismissed. 
<br><br>
<br>People are constrained by narrow views of their problems that perpetuate rigid patterns of false solutions. 
<br>The meanings people attribute to behavior limit the range of alternatives they will use to deal with a situation. 
<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems. 
<br>The language of problems tends to be different from the language of solutions. 

<br>Problem talk:

<br>Negative
<br>Focuses on the past
<br>Implies permanence of problems. 




<br><br>
<br>Clients are experts in their own lives. 

<br>Clients know what they need 
<br>Is there anything else I should have asked you or that you need to tell me?
<br>The therapist needs to know how to set aside their own frame of reference as much as possible and explore those of their clients. 


<br>People are resourceful. 
<br>Problems are normal life-cycle complications. 
<br>Families have the abillity to construct solutions that can enhance their lives. 
<br><br>
<br>Solution-focused therapists steer families away from speculating about problem formation. 
<br>Problems persist in the way people define situations and in the misdirected actions they persist in taking. 
<br><br>
<br>Set clear goals and build on exceptions to problems. 
<br>Good therapy is more than implementing specific techniques, it also involves therapeutic alliance. 
<br>The goal of solution-focused therapy is to resolve the presenting problem as expeditiously as possible. 
<br>The goal is not about how families should be structured, but only what they want different in their lives. 
<br>The model emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-defined goals, framed in positive terms and modest enough to be achievable.

<br>What will you be doing instead?


<br>The model works by helping clients amplify exceptions to their problems – effective solutions already in their repertoire.
<br>Changing the way people talk about their problems is all that needs to be accomplished.
<br>As the family and therapist talk more and more about the solution they want to construct together, they come to believe in what they are talking about.
<br>It is easier to get people to talk differently about their problems than it is to get them to change their behavior.
<br>Getting people to talk positively will help them think positively and ultimately act positively to solve their problems.
<br>Change perception helps with the change of behavior. As a picture of positive future develops, the family begins to see themselves differently and they respond to what they see. 
<br>They begin living in the solution, not the problem. 
<br>The 'virtuous cycle' gets going, the family gets unstuck, and they move forward. 
<br><br>
<br>Time limited
<br>Sessions are made one at a time
<br>One may be enough
<br>Typical course includes 3-5 sessions
<br>Clients can return as-needed
<br>Often a week to a few weeks apart
<br>Once you know more of what works, do more of it
<br><br>
<br>Gather a brief description of the presenting problem. 
<br>Move to directly asking clients about how things will be different in their lives then their probelms are solved. 
<br>Ask about times in the clients' lives when their problems do not happen or are less severe. 
<br><br>
<br>What do you think the problem is now?
<br>How will you know when the problem is solved?
<br>How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
<br>What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
<br>What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?
<br><br>
<br>What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back?
<br><br>
<br>Takes little intake information because they want to hear clients' constructions of their problems firsthand (in session). 
<br>Asks more about perceptions than feelings. 
<br>Affirms clients' positions by conveying understanding of their point of view. 
<br>Doesn't function as an expert; clients are experts on what they want to change. 
<br>Takes an active position in moving clients away from worrying about their predicament and toward steps to solution. 
<br>Anyone who is concerned about the problem should attend sessions and are part of the solution.
<br>Consultant
<br>Guardian of the conversation
<br>Don't get bogged down in 'problem talk'
<br>Focus on what is right
<br>Direct clients away from the problem-saturated narrative. 
<br>Therapist attempts to create a context for the family to develop more useful ways of responding. 
<br>Focus on the 'here and now'
<br>The future provides a blank canvas on which the family can paint a picture of their wishes and hopes. 
<br>Assumes a position of 'not knowing.'
<br><br>
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
<br>Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
<br>Constructing a more detailed description of the therapeutic goal. 
<br><br>
<br>Once a description of the goal has been developed, the therapist asks the client to assess their current level of progress toward

<br><br>Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT) attempts to improve Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT) by incorporating an emphasis on promoting acceptance into TBCTs emphasis on behavioral change. This study examined changes in couples' communication over the course of IBCT and TBCT. Early, middle, and late sessions were coded to measure couples' communication of acceptance. Results showed that IBCT couples expressed more nonblaming descriptions of problems and more soft emotions than TBCT couples during late stages of therapy. IBCT couples significantly increased their nonblaming description of problems and significantly decreased their expressions of hard emotions and their problematic communication over time. Results support the hypothesis that structural differences between the therapies affect initial levels of emotional expression in session. Increases in nonblaming descriptions of problems were significantly correlated with increases in marital satisfaction.<br><br>

 <br><br>
<br>Linear thinking:

<br>Behavior is based on previous consequences. 


<br>Major Tenet:

<br>Behavior is determined by its consequences more than its antecedents. 


<br>Types of conditioning:

<br><a data-href="Classical Conditioning" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/classical-conditioning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Classical Conditioning</a>

<br><br>
<br>Big Picture:

<br>Behavioral Family Therapists are less likely to talk about how families develop and/or operate. They are concerned about the present, and how the problem is being reinforced. 


<br>Symptoms:

<br>Although they are reluctant to do so, Behavioral Therapists have delineated what distinguishes a 'healthy family' and a 'dysfunctional family' (pg. 69-74 and 97-104 in FT Handbook chapters)


<br><br>
<br>Mutually shared goals and expectations. 
<br>Support for the stresses associated with the expected transitional life stages, and other stressful life events. 
<br>Mutual influence, that is positive more than negative. 
<br><a data-href="Boundaries" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/boundaries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Boundaries</a> (more implicit by separating family into dyads)
<br>Tolerance for Deviance
<br>Skills in conflict resolution
<br>Adaptability
<br>Flexibility
<br>The ability to change when necessary
<br><br>
<br>The goal of treatment is to change the problem behavior by changing the consequences of it, or the contingencies of it. 
<br>Techniques
<br>Use of Self

<br>Intervention begins with an assessment of the target child's behavior. The goal of the assessment is to get a baseline of the behavior so that you can quantify change. 
<br>Functional Analysis of Behavior:

<br>Once the problem behavior is identified, then the antecedents and consequences surrounding the behavior are explored. (stimuli, organismic variables, target behavior/response, consequences, contingencies).
<br>Report the assessment to the family. 


<br>Intervene in the pattern.

<br>Step 1: Induction (teach the lingo)
<br>Step 2: Demonstration (show them how it works)
<br>Step 3: Implementation (contingency contracts, time-out, star charts, marble game, etc.)


<br>Generalization: 

<br>The goal is that this training will be generalized to other behaviors, but booster sessions are also helpful. 




<br><br>
<br>Alexander and Parsons (1982) created for troubled adolescents and their families. Incorporates cognitive aspects and takes a more systemic approach, while the goal is behavioral change. 
<br>Integrates three perspectives:

<br>Ecological
<br>Learning Theory
<br>Cognitive
<br>Two Phases of Treatment


<br><br>
<br>Therapy:

<br>Designed to modify attitudes, assumptions, expectations, labels and emotions of the family. The major focus is to relabel (reframe) the problem behavior into something positive. 


<br>Education:

<br>Help family behave differently in conjunction with reattributions. 


<br><br>
<br>Resistance to treatment is considered an impediment to change. It is a natural consequence of the inappropriate application of technology and failure of the clinician to understand the meaning of the behavior. 
<br><br>
<br>Functional Family Therapy relabels behaviors to reduce resistance and to motivate change by providing reattributions for the causes of family members' behaviors. 

<br>Change in meaning is a necessary precursor to behavior change. 
<br>The relabeling (reframe, positive connotation, etc.) operates at three levels:


<br><br>
<br>Interactional Level:

<br>Benign description of the interpersonal impact of the behavior (distance regulation)


<br>Motivational Level:

<br>Recasts the motive for the behavior in a benign light. 


<br>Systemic Level:

<br>Emphasizes the similarities between people, a family theme. 


<br>If the reframe works it interrupts automatic processing, interrupts the behaviors that follow from this processing, and thus, changes the contingencies around the problem behavior. 
<br><br>
<br>Functional Family Therapy emphasizes paying attention to the interpersonal functions of behaviors:

<br>Functions:

<br>A person's pattern of behaviors, feelings, and thoughts mediate amounts of psychological relatedness in a relationship with another person (distance regulation)
<br>The expression of the function can be labeled good, bad, or neutral, the function itself is not judged. 
<br>These functions are properties of relationships not traits.




<br><br>
<br>Linear Thinking:

<br>Cognitive processes need to be incorporated, although some would argue that they were never eliminated in the first place (i.e. cognition is a behavior). Meanings of behaviors, attribution processes, belief sets, automatic thinking can get in the way of contingency change. 


<br>Unit of analysis tends to be the dyad:

<br>Behavior therapists have moved toward more contextual assessments, but each move out focuses on the one to one relationship rather than the system as a whole. 


<br>Dependency on the therapist?

<br>Therapist teaches the model. 


<br>Based on postivism

<br>Not postmodern, it is modern. 


<br>Politics of behavioral couple therapy, acceptance. 
<br><br>
<br>Same process as parent training. Assessment is always first. <a data-href="Social Exchange Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/social-exchange-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Social Exchange Theory</a> viewpoint. 
<br>Could include couple discussing an issue in the room, with therapist observing communication patterns. Also includes evaluating the relationship itself (pg. 106-107).

<br>Strengths
<br>Major complaints
<br>Sex life (affection)
<br>Future goals
<br>Alternatives to the relationship
<br>Individual functioning of each spouse


<br>Intervention:

<br>Once assessment is complete you set goals with the clients, focusing on one problem (well defined) at a time, this comes in the form of a contract. 

<br>Major Goals:

<br>Increase positive control while decreasing aversive control. 
<br>Improve communication, which should facilitate future problem solving. 


<br>Interventions:

<br>Active listening with behavioral descriptions of the problem
<br>Teach new behavior exchanges
<br>Encourage couple to establish clear and effective means of sharing power and decision making. 
<br>Teach strategies for future problem solving






<br>Techniques:

<br>Caring Days

<br>Make a list of what your partner could do to make you feel cared for. The partner does not need to do anything in return. Do not include sex as it can be seen as coercion. 


<br>Quid Pro Quo Contracts

<br>Not very common because we get into the standstill of 'they have to do it first'


<br>Good Faith Contracts

<br>Both partners engage in those behaviors whether their partner does or does not. 




<br>Politics and Power
<br><br>
<br>Politics of Behavioral Couple Therapy (i.e. Jacobson)

<br>Jacobson saw the issue with classic BMT as a problem with power, who gets to say what needs to change?
<br>IBCT was developed from these concerns, the focus shifted to acceptance and forgiveness.


<br>IBCT Deep Analysis:

<br>D

<br>Key differences between partners in personality, interests, goals, etc. 


<br>E

<br>Emotional sensitivities or vulnerabilities that each partner brings to the relationship (create a vicious cycle)


<br>E

<br>External circumstances (i.e., stressful circumstances which could exacerbate the problems created by differences and vulnerabilities)


<br>P

<br>Patterns of interaction that couples get into as they try to navigate what comes from DEE above. 




<br>Intervention based on the idea that all relationship problems result from the combination of a triggering action or inaction and a sensitive reaction. 
<br>They suggest that relationship problems can be resolved by altering the triggering action and the vulnerable response (emotional acceptance).
<br>Empirical support for the model in both clinical trials and efficacy research.

<br>"We may feel secure enough to explore if we can predict that support will be readily available if and when it is needed, especially if new ventures run into trouble or if potentially dangerous situations arise. Difficulties that lead to consultations with a family therapist often arise out of conflict within the family's own relationships."
<br>"The family script can provide routines for family life which can be followed almost automatically."
<br>"Repetition becomes the background against which change is the foreground, that which is new becomes the focus of attention. In contrast, chaos obscures potentially significant change, unless the new behavior facilitates consistency, in which case that new patter becomes the foreground, thus becoming the new center of attention."
<br>"Rewriting family scripts follows the sequence of a scripted pattern giving way to some improvisation followed by the establishment of a new pattern."
<br>"Family scripts can be defined as the family's shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts."

<br>The term 'expectations' implies anticipation of what is to be said and done within family relationships, as well as family pressures to perform the roles as expected. If one member fails to perform in the prescribed way, another member of the family may be recruited to take up that role instead. 

<br>The plot is 'scripted' while the cast can change. 




<br>Family scripts are revealed when repeating patterns of family interaction are either observed or described.
<br>Family Scenario:

<br>An encounter of which it can be said that something significant happens within family relationships. 
<br>Basic elements of family scenario:

<br>Context

<br>Families engaging with each other around a particular task or situation


<br>Plot

<br>Family members 'motives' become clear as the scenario unfolds


<br>Outcome

<br>The consequences of the encounter are revealed




<br>The expected scenarios for each particular family situation thread together to create an overall script for how all family relationships are expected to be conducted in general. 
<br>"Problem Scenarios":

<br>Instead called 'Attempted Solution Scenarios'

<br>This helps us to focus attention on how each person tries to solve the problem. 
<br>The behavior that is experienced now as problematic may have started out as an attempted solution to an earlier problem. 
<br>The co-constructed story may then become part of the family beliefs about what to expect of itself. 






<br><br>
<br>Improvising implies abandoning the set script and extemporizing instead. This may happen when the old script does not fit the current situation, or when those involved are in sear of something different.
<br>The therapist can help to create a new co-constructed scenario by suggesting a goal which the family then achieves in their own way. 
<br>Suggest a scenario in which it becomes necessary for the family to improvise. (in two parent families, the parents should devise a strategy together)
<br>Try to block each move that has not worked in the past. 
<br>Unraveling some of the origins of the scripted scenarios frees families to explore new pathways. Work on the present and the past can reinforce each other. 
<br><br>
<br>Replicated Scripts

<br>Parents with their own individual scenarios from childhood that are repeated


<br>Corrective Scripts

<br>Choice of the opposite style of parenting


<br>Improvised scripts

<br>Corrective scripts repeated over time


<br><br>
<br>The therapist's background also plays a part in shaping scenarios in therapy. 
<br><br>
<br>Positive Labeling

<br>Can be given to replicative scrips by labeling them as being loyal to the family of origin. 


<br>Corrective scripts can be given a positive frame by pointing out to parents that they are struggling to provide a better experience for their children than their parents were able to provide for them. 

<br>Improvised scripts (unlike the historical replicative and corrective scripts) are written in response to current situations. They are improvised either out of necessity or driven by curiosity and a wish to explore new ways of relating. 

<br>A stimulus for improvisation is a degree of uncertainty about what to do next so that interaction must be played off the cuff. 


<br>Positive comments can be made about how much the family is exploring unknown territory. 


<br><br>
<br>Attachment behavior

<br>The behavior of a person seeking proximity to his or her attachment figure in a potentially dangerous situation. (This is a mechanism that protects children - or adults - when vulnerable)
<br>The child uses the parent as a safe base from which to explore, and parent and child stay in contact to ensure that they can get together in the presence of any potential danger.


<br>In terms of script theory a potentially threatening situation evokes tightly scripted behavior in which parent and child predictably got together. Exploration allows for more improvisation. 
<br>The therapist can become a temporary attachment figure to the family. The therapist must be aware of the factors that threaten the family's relationship. 
<br>Any new behavior of uncertain origin emerging in a relationship (e.g., unexplained impatience) might be seen as either strange and treated as potentially dangerous, or novel and will arouse curiosity. 

<br>If it is perceived as strange, attempts may be made to avoid reprovoking the impatience, returning to old familiar ways instead. 
<br>If the impatience arouses curiosity, then it will probably lead to trying to discover what it is all about, and to improvise ways of dealing with it. 
<br>If it becomes clear that the impatience poses a problem and something has to be done about it, new solutions may be improvised out of the necessity to sort things out. 


<br>There are two main forms of improvisation in family relationships:

<br>Improvisation that comes out of necessity (Something has to be done when old solutions are not working)
<br>Improvisation out of curiosity when it feels safe to try something new, even if it is uncertain where it will lead. 


<br>A therapist who is trusted by the family can make the risks involved in improvisation feel less frightening, even when family relationships are insecure.

Psychoanalytic Models of Family Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Most psychoanalytic models are based on Freud's idea around the identity, ego and super ego, or the development of self. For Freud the drives were sexual (in terms of possession and control), for newer psychoanalytic ideas the drives are more around connection and validation of the self (good or bad).
<br>Object Relations Theory in some ways provides a bridge between psychodynamic theory and systems theory. We relate to people in the present based on expectations formed by early experience. 
<br>Normal Development (?)

<br>Early development is based on attachment theory/separation-individuation constructs. 
<br>Infant is born ready to be in a reciprocal relationship. This is activated by relating to a parent, by being loved and loving. 
<br>Stages of development based on object relations: internal object (mental image of self and other, and self in relation to other). 


<br><br>
<br>Objectless (primary narcissism/autistic) there is no other, only self. 
<br>The following stages focus on the development of self through relations with internal and external objects: first the actual interactions and then the unconscious residue of the interactions. 
<br>As humans, we exist in the context of relationships not as single units: There is no self without an object, there is no object without a self. 
<br>Infants develop in a context of concentric 'holding environments.' As infants internalize the guarding, protecting, soothing and nurture of this 'holding environment' they begin to form a self (even if the environment is inadequate).
<br>These early experiences then form our 'unconscious' drives for connection or separation. 'Real' others are 'used' to satisfy those drives, and we find others to validate our sense of self (good or bad).
<br><br>
<br>Health: achieving and preserving psychic wholeness through good object relations, integrating our 'unconscious' with our consciousness. 
<br>Self and its relationships with others rest on and are expressed by the degree to which relations between the self and object are gratifying (but some theorists would suggest that since we are so narcissistic in the beginning, the relationships with others are never gratifying enough. Is it possible to be healthy?)
<br><br>
<br>Fairbairn suggest that as we internalize objects we are inevitably disappointed by them, in order to defend against this pain, we do the follow:

<br>We split off those aspects that are too painful to be tolerated.
<br>Repress these intolerable aspects. 
<br>This modifies the ego.


<br>Pathology occurs when some aspects of the repressed self-object system are excessively repressed, leaving the central self depleted with an impoverished relationship to the 'ideal object.'
<br>Other forms of pathology occur when the central self system is taken over by one of the usual repressed systems, such as those whose relations are characterized by continual patterns of distance and rage with the apparent disappearance of reality. 
<br>Fear-dictated flight from early object relations is also considered the deepest root of psychological problems. 
<br><br>
<br>Skynner (1981)

<br>Diffuse boundaries
<br>Unclear identities
<br>Satisfaction from fantasy as opposed to reality
<br>Difficulty coping with separation and loss
<br>Attempts to preserve past states of relationships
<br>Attempts to manipulate others into rigidly held views of them


<br><br>
<br>The major goal of Object Relations Theory is to free family members of unconscious restrictions so that they will be able to interact with one another as whole, healthy persons on the basis of current realities rather than unconscious images. 

<br>The encounter between the therapist and client is the intervention. The relationship is the crucible for change and growth. 
<br>The therapeutic process is the same as 'normal development' during infancy. The therapist provides the holding environment, contains/introjects the clients' emotions, resolves them, understands them, somehow makes them acceptable, and then the client introjects the resolution of the emotions. Therapist projects back a 'corrective experience.'
<br>Self of therapist is key: 

<br>Transference and counter-transference are the keystones of any psychoanalytic therapy, meaning the therapist must constantly be aware of who they are' for the client, and who the client is for them. 


<br>Change occurs through insight and working through. 
<br>Techniques: 

<br>Listening
<br>Empathy
<br>Interpretation and maintaining neutrality with respect to what or how things change




<br><br>
<br>Big Picture (how families operate/develop):

<br>He uses attachment theory as a base. Early attachment relationships create 'working models' of how relationships are supposed to be, they create 'scripts.' as people interact with each other to become a family, they create their own 'family script' based on these early 'working models.' families have attachment patterns that are full of meanings about abandonment, engulfment, intrusion, etc. (i.e., distance regulation)
<br>These scripts provide routines for family life which can be followed automatically. They are shared expectations of how family roles are to be performed within various contexts.
<br>These scripts may be carried out from generation to generation in one form or another. Some use replicative scripts (repeat what has happened in the past), while others use corrective scripts (trying not to repeat scripts from the family of origin). There is a constant tension between these two. 
<br>Healthy vs. Dysfunctional families

<br>Healthy families have scripts that provide a set of roles with which each member can identify and which provides room for improvisation when facing new situations. These scripts promote interactional awareness:

<br>Consequences of interaction
<br>Self-awareness (why you are acting in a particular way)
<br>Empathic awareness (why others are acting in particular ways)
<br>Understanding the meaning of the interaction
<br>Shared coherent perception of what is happening






<br><br>
<br>Symptoms occur when there is difficulty updating scripts. They may occur because the script necessary remains someone or something too painful to relive. Intolerable information is blocked or edited both intraphysically and interpersonally (secrets)\
<br>Symptoms may also occur when a family script is used to prevent what members may fear to be an even worse disaster. Even though the current script is painful, it is rigidly clung to (the solution has become to problem)
<br><br>
<br>Major goal is improvisation (flexibility). In order to create an environment safe enough to explore options however, the therapist must provide a secure base from which to explore. Paradoxically, scripts, although repetitive, provide the background against which change can occur. 
<br>Attachment notions

<br>Secure
<br>Curious
<br>Improvisation
<br>Uncertainty
<br>Insecure
<br>Avoid strangeness
<br>Stick with the familiar


<br><br>
<br>Instead of conflict in the family arising out of one person's pathology which extends to influence another's behavior, family scripts are encoded in all family members' minds, but each family member plays a particular role. Therefore, each member of the family can be taught to see how their role contributes to the problem, rather than asking the 'sick one' to reown the bad object and working through these issues. 
<br><br>
<br>Reduce strategies that undermine problem-solving abilities (i.e., triangulating, scapegoating, etc.)
<br>Reduce strategies that undermine security (threats about leaving, control, etc.)
<br>Move toward collaboration rather than coercion and blame. 
<br>Re-edit scripts so the roles are fillable by the individuals in the family. 
<br>Move closer to an ideal script in which a wide scope of improvising is possible. 
<br>Develop a hopeful script. 
<br>Promote ownership of family's success, attributable to them not you as the therapist. 
<br><br>
<br>This is still important for the therapist to attend to. The therapist needs to contain the family's emotions in a way so as not to become another player in their script. Therapists own scripts can also be replayed, thus it is essential that the therapist understand their own family script. Byng-Hall outlines methods for staying out of the script and for containing emotional impact:

<br>Staying out:

<br>Use teams, get supervision, have a clear plan, use circular questioning
<br>Containing:

<br>Reflecting on the process, seeing emotions as valuable information, differentiating your script from the family's, share your emotional experience with the family. 






<br><br>
<br>Absolves people of responsibility for their behavior (it is my mother's fault)
<br>Lack of empirical testing
<br>Tautological thinking:

<br>Make an interpretation, it is rejected, patient is resistant, you must be onto something. 


<br>Perspective is individualist or dyadic without revision. 
<br>Deterministic, linear thinking (it is my mother's fault)
<br>Blaming the victim (you put yourself in this situation, because of what your mother did)
<br>Mother blaming
<br>Long process

<br><br>
<br>This is the cornerstone construct for Nagy's work. 
<br>Trust
<br>Loyalty (split, invisible)
<br>Entitlement (destructive)
<br>All of these influence justice and fairness in relationships and are transmitted through generations. 
<br><br>
<br>Ontic: 'I-Thou' relationship, or dialogue
<br><br>
<br>Revolving Slate, justice and fairness

<br>All humans have worth and should be provided with 'due care.'
<br>When we don't get the care we deserve we develop symptoms
<br>We develop destructive entitlement which continues the cycle. 


<br><br>
<br>Multidirected partiality
<br>Acknowledgement/accountability/crediting
<br>Exoneration
<br>Therapist use of self: you need to believe/live the theory and examine your own entitlements. 
<br><br>
<br>Family Transaction &amp; Power
<br>Relational Fairness/Ethical Dimension
<br>Ontic
<br>Facts
<br>Psychology
<br><br>
<br>Dimension II:

<br>Strong emotional reactions (anger, shame)
<br>Behaviors (control-seeking or chaotic/risky) 

<br>Nay point to a destructive entitlement. As humans, we are born with value and are entitled to do care. When we do not get that, we develop a destructive entitlement. We seek others to meet our needs. We treat our partner as an object rather than a person in a relationship. 




<br>Dimension III (Transactions):

<br>Rigid or chaotic structures
<br>Power struggles
<br>High conflicts
<br>Conflicts over 'nothing'


<br><br>
<br>Violation of trust

<br>


<br>Destructive entitlement

<br>


<br>Parentification

<br>Parent using the child to get the parents do care needs met. 


<br>Overgiving

<br>Over functioning, one of the partners decides what is wrong and how to fix it. They decide what is wrong with the other person and how they need to fix it. Getting into someone else's lane.


<br>Not making 'claims'

<br>People not claiming self. People not holding themselves accountable.


<br>Loyalty conflicts or its 'invisibility'

<br>


<br><br>
<br>Restoring trust and balance of fairness in relationships
<br>Opening relational resources
<br>Opening a dialogue about fairness
<br>Direct address
<br>Presenting options 
<br>Enhancing an individual's capacity to consider the needs of others and acknowledgement of their acts
<br>Enhancing an individual's capacity to stand up for his/her own needs and to do self-validation through acts
<br>Earned merit and due consideration = balance
<br><br>
<br>Not neutral 

<br>Multidirected Partiality

<br>Not being neutral, being multidirectedly partial that you acknowledge each person's perspective and saying 'I get it. I understand why you may think that way.' You want the couples to learn how to validate someone else's perspective. Not agreeing with it, but just expanding the ability for a person to have compassion for others. Getting couples to ask for what 
<br>You have been with me long enough you should know. Opening up of relational issues. 
<br>People cannot be in a relationship and give nothing. Keep looking for their contribution. Want couples to validate each other and themselves. 
<br>As people acknowledge that other people make contributions (due consideration), we feel that we are getting the due consideration. 


<br>For couples therapy - considering


<br>Transitional
<br>Nonjudgmental
<br>Facilitating - 'sowing seeds and opening doors' and giving moratorium

<br>But - therapy still can be 'short-term'


<br>Avoids becoming parentified
<br>Therapists' own relational histories may resonate with those of their clients

<br>'Self-of-the-therapist' issues may prevent clinicians from keeping a balanced stance towards members of the family
<br>Therapist does not need to be liked by their clients. Why is it so important that your clients like you? Should your clients get better for you to be a good therapist?

<br>Myth of Fusion: 

<br>Human's must come to grips with 'aloneness.' Once we accept our aloneness then we have to make meaning for our lives. 
<br>"We believe people who love us should 'just know' what we need."
<br>We have to accept we are a self. Once we accept our aloneness, we must make meaning of our lives. 


<br>Freedom and Responsibility
<br>Humanistic Psychology:

<br>Humans are good and move toward growth if unhindered. 


<br><br>
<br>Whitaker and others claim to be a-theoretical. However, Whitaker was a systems theorist and used ideas from humanistic psychology and psychoanalytic theory to guide his therapy. 
<br><a data-href="Jay Haley" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/strategic-family-therapy/key-figures/jay-haley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jay Haley</a> thought he could change a family behind a mirror by telling a therapist what to do. Experiential therapists did not believe this is true. They want the family to be open to their emotional experience and thoughts they are having. 
<br>Anti-Technician:

<br>Rather than a-theoretical, Whitaker and other experiential therapists are anti-technician. Manipulation does not encourage open experiencing. 


<br><br>
<br>Through feeling expression, families are able to balance separateness and connectedness. 
<br><br>
<br>Always 'becoming' or moving forward, toward growth. 
<br>Emotions/affect are validated and nurtured. Rules create balance: respect for affect and getting along. 
<br>Permeable boundaries which encourage expression of intimacy needs, differentiation, bonding, conflict expression/resolution, problem solving, and playfulness. 
<br><br>
<br>Symptoms develop when affect is blocked, impulses are denied and feelings are suppressed. 
<br>Boundaries and processes are rigid: holding themselves together is more important than experiencing life. 
<br>Superficial experience of emotion, self-denial, lack of empathy, lack of commitment, inability to handle conflict
<br>Little awareness, little sense of choice, flow of behavior is blocked because of unexpressed emotion.
<br><a data-href="Carl Whitaker" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/carl-whitaker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carl Whitaker</a> suggested that there were 3 contexts to our symptoms:

<br>'Driven Crazy' in an interpersonal context in which person is belittled or disqualified.
<br>'Going Crazy' a state of temporary disorganization.
<br>'Acting Crazy' an adaptation to the context.


<br><br>
<br>Increased personal integrity, greater freedom of choice, less dependence, expanded experiencing. 
<br>Strengthening the family as a system by increasing connectedness within the nuclear family and across generations. Enhance ability to support the completion of developmental tasks. 
<br><br>
<br>Battle for Structure
<br>Battle for Initiative
<br>Working Phase
<br>Termination
<br>Use of non-rational, symbol, and metaphor. 
<br>Use of self is paramount: any technique comes from the therapist's creativity. 
<br>Create a new therapeutic environment to alter the family's interaction in hopes of producing a different affective experience. 
<br>Interrupt rigid, repetitive cycles
<br>Activate and allow for constructive anxiety or confusion. 
<br>Expand the presenting problem
<br>Encourage and support any new decision (freedom to choose). 
<br>Create trans-generational boundaries. 
<br>Create a therapeutic supra-system in which the therapist and family are aligned, and the therapist still has the ability to differentiate (get in and get out).
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Self-Worth:

<br>How people learn to be people


<br>Communication:

<br>The ways people use to work out meaning with one another (Placating, Blaming, Computing, Distracting, Leveling/Congruence)

<br>Placating (peacekeeper)
<br>Blamer (im not happy its your fault)
<br>Computing (have to have a rational explanation, ultra rationale)
<br>Distracting (acts out when there is stress, someone who uses humor)
<br>Leveling/Congruence 




<br>Rules:

<br>The rules people use for how they should feel and act, which eventually develop into the family system. 
<br>Freedom to comment:

<br>What can you say
<br>To whom can you say it
<br>How do you go about it if you disagree or disapprove of someone or something
<br>How do you question when you do not understand
<br>Taboo subjects
<br>Taboo feelings
<br>Expressing affection
<br>Secrets


<br>Overarching goal may be to loosen up the system so there is freedom to comment. Maybe you say it yourself, maybe use family sculpting, 


<br>Link to Society:

<br>How the family interacts with the outside world


<br><br>
<br>When communication patterns are rigid (other than congruence) and continual, and you can't comment on that.
<br>Symptoms are symptoms of the system
<br>Symptoms are created through the process of interaction
<br><br>
<br>Low self-worth
<br>Communication is indirect, vague, not honest
<br>Rules are rigid and non-negotiable
<br>Link to society is fearful, placating, and blaming
<br><br>
<br>Congruence (you the therapist must be congruent) (as a therapist, when you have a sense of what is going on in the room, you say it<br>
“Recording 20240412103404.webm” could not be found.<br>
)<br>
- Only with congruence can we know each other fully and we can use our differences creatively. 
<br>Focus of intervention

<br>Helping people change and grow in:

<br>Communication
<br>Beliefs about being able to grow
<br>Restoring the use of all the senses




<br>Therapist use of self is key (as with all experiential models)

<br>To alleviate symptoms you have to intervene in the process in a way that won't replicate their process.


<br>Conditions for Chage

<br>Trust
<br>Development of awareness
<br>Development of understanding
<br>Development of awareness of options
<br>Practice


<br>Universal goal for all families

<br>Development of self-worth
<br>Freedom to comment


<br><br>
<br>Techniques should emerge from the therapist/client interaction. 
<br>Techniques are only useful in a context of trust.

<br>These processes are simultaneous and constant as the system adapts and also maintains its integrity. 
<br><br>
<br>When continuity and the need to accommodate to change become integrated in the system then the system is flexible and stable at the same time.

<br><br>
<br>Symptoms:

<br>What is different about families that are 'healthy' and families that develop symptoms?
<br>How do symptoms develop?

<br>They would not be repeated if it was not supported by the system.

<br>How can we intervene to change the way the family operates given the theory?
<br>What is the focus of the intervention?

<br>Is it having them act in a certain way? What is the focus?

<br>
Read 'Publishing in Graduate School: Tips for New Graduate Students'

<br>
Read OSU Authorship Guidelines

<br>
Read 'Writing and Procrastination' by Kerry Ann Roquemore

<br>
Writing is a skill that you exercise and develop over time. 

<br>
Work towards peer review papers rather than chapters. Books in HDFS are not written often. 

<br>
Publishing may get denied. The paper may not fit. Journals show their desk rejections online. HDFS journals is minimal (10%-20%). Usually rejected for fit, editor may not like your topic, 

<br>
3 reviewers if paper has potential, reviewers are people in my field who give extensive paragraph, 3 primary options (accepted (very rare), revise and resubmit (common, substantial changes need to be made, may need to do a couple times for it to be accepted), rejections (happens frequently, still getting feedback, feedback is always something you can improve))

<br>
Time you submit to when you get it back (3-5 months usually to get paper back)

<br>How much time you take on a paper will vary
<br>Average time is about a year to a year and a half (if paper is accepted by place you submitted) (publishing early matters)
<br>Revise and resubmit


<br>
Institute of Medicine, standards of authorship, 

<br>
Are your consultations based on this person teaching you how to do it and you do it on your own, or it is them just doing it for you. That could change authorship. 

<br>
You want your work to serve multiple purposes and how can I make a paper out of it?

<br>Talk to faculty when ideas are flowing to understand if your idea is something that you can actually make happen


<br>
Be broad on what you are choosing to work with others. Be thoughtful if project will be a drag on my time or be something that excites me. 

<br>
Saying yes to something means you are saying no to something else.

<br>
Beyond presenting

<br>Go to conference if being paid to go. 
<br>Conference program, look at what is closely related to what you do, methods that you are interested in, go to keynote speakers (Good way to get important sense of what is going on in field, even if not directly related)
<br>You should be going to the majority of sessions every day. 
<br>Networking

<br>Conference is great place to meet people
<br>Reach out to professor in advance
<br>Best thing you can do at conference is network with other fellow students.

<br>The likelihood that an element will be selected from the population for inclusion in the sample. In a census of all the elements of a population, the probability that any particular element will be selected is 1.0. If half the elements in the population are sampled on the basis of chance (say, by tossing a coin), the probability of selection for each element is one half, or 0.5. As the size of the sample as a proportion of the population decreases, so does the probability of selection.

<br>A place for you to lay out your methodological approach prior to collecting and analyzing data (quantitative or qualitative).
<br>Your methods may be changed (and strengthened through the first stage of review). But this also ensures acceptance as long as the project is completed as described, regardless of results. 
<br><br>
<br>Uploaded and stored (typically publicly), but not typically reviewed. 
<br>A place for you to lay out your methodological approach prior to collecting and analyzing data (quantitative or qualitative).
<br>When submitting to a journal after getting results, being able to cite your own pre-registration is useful and looked upon positively. 
<br><br>
<br>Research Questions
<br>Justification for Questions (Including a Literature Review)
<br>Detailed Methods and Analysis Plans
<br><br>
<br>Look at journals
<br>Look at registries for pre-registrations:

<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="Https://osf.io/registries" target="_blank">Https://osf.io/registries</a>


<br><br>
<br>Essentially the introduction and methods section of a journal article
<br>Lots of details

<br>Deciding these things up front leads to better science (reduces the temptation to make decisions that are easy, like stopping data collection early, or likely to give significant findings).


<br><br><br><br>
<br>Allows outsiders to see your intentions
<br>Guides the design of your methods

<br>Specificity is key. 

<br>Without it, your intentions remain unknown and you cannot design a quality study. 
<br>Don't jump to methods too quickly. 




<br><br>
<br>Proof
<br>Originality
<br>Relevance
<br>Ethical
<br>Personal (Not necessary)
<br><br>
<br>Aims (broad)
<br>Research Questions (specific)
<br>Hypotheses (not always)
<br>Outcomes (expected contribution to knowledge)
<br><br>
<br>Contributes to existing knowledge

<br>Contribution doesn't have to be huge
<br>Replication is a contribution


<br>Being able to express relevance clearly and in non-exaggerated terms is a critical research skill. 
<br>Use the current literature (and the real world) to demonstrate relevance. 
<br>Literature review is an analysis, not a summary. 
<br>Use it to:

<br>Show what you are building off of
<br>Show what you are adding

<br>Filling a gap is not enough justification




<br><br>
<br>Can you do it? Can you do it well? Can you do it in a timely manner?
<br>Money
<br>Time
<br>Your time is your most important resource. 
<br>Do not take on a project that you will lead if it only leads to one paper (except for in very rare circumstances).

<br>Try to commit to doing 3 papers on a topic

<br>More efficient time use (e.g., read similar literature)
<br>Looks good when others are evaluating your CV




<br><br><br>
<br>This is a key writing skill that you will need to do for every paper you write. 
<br>And for your Registered Reports/Pre-Registrations
<br>Hook the reader in. 
<br>2-3 paragraph formula
<br><br><br>
<br>Explain the larger context that this study will inform. 
<br>Start big and then work down to the end of the paragraph to set up something more specific that is important to know. 
<br><br>
<br>Flows directly from the earlier points. If studying X is important, then here is what I am doing. 
<br>State the basic aims/hypotheses/questions and give the briefest overview of the data and methods (focusing on strengths).
<br><br>
<br>Explain the potential impact of the specific things you lay out in the prior paragraph. That could be theoretically, it could be in terms of policy, it could be in terms of filling holes, etc. 
<br>This is hard. 
<br>It can be combined with paragraph 2
<br><br><br>
<br>Your questions for your Registered Report have to have purpose, relevance, and feasibility. 
<br>If qualitative, consider these your 'initial questions.'
<br>Either way, they need enough specificity to guide your research plan. 
<br>We often have an overarching aim/question or two and then questions that build on them. 

<br>2-4 research questions are most common. 


<br>
<br>Either edit the questions you have already prepared or developed new questions for your registered report. 
<br>Discuss your questions (and their purpose, relevance, and feasibility) with your partner.

<br>As a partner, think about the logic and organization of the outline.

Research Ethics and IRB]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Two course principles that come through today:

<br>Think deeply and early about all decisions you make in your research.
<br>Be transparent about decisions you make and practices you use. 


<br>What is ethical?
<br>What approvals do I need to get?
<br>Avoiding harm:

<br>Stress and mental health risk is a key potential harm in HDFS research. 
<br>But other things too - job performance, etc. 
<br>Avoid undue intrusion

<br>Only ask what is necessary

<br>(Example: immigration status)


<br>Harm threshold: only amount of stress the participant would experience in day to day life. 




<br>Informed consent for minors (under 18):

<br>Parents consent, minors assent
<br>Parents provide written consent
<br>Minors can choose not to participate even if their parents consent (e.g., babies in a lab)
<br>Has to actually inform (thorough, readable, understandable)
<br>Has to be voluntary

<br>Power issues

<br>Student research?


<br>Voluntary throughout the study
<br>Only applies to activities covered in the signed consent form




<br>Consent should be in writing unless you have a waiver. 

<br>Online surveys; phone surveys


<br>Exceptions to informed consent for active research are rare. 
<br>Misrepresentation or deception

<br>Avoid as much as possible
<br>Examples of acceptable or unacceptable deception
<br>When is it acceptable?

<br>Justified (necessary to get valid answers)
<br>Low risk
<br>Provides debriefing




<br>Maintaining confidentiality

<br>Changing more than names
<br>Who is around when data is being collected

<br>Just participating can breach confidentiality depending on study inclusion criteria


<br>Securing data

<br>Always stay up-to-date on current procedures
<br>Always immediately de-identify and sexurely store key

<br>Amending your study
<br>Knowing what to submit (transparency):

<br>Look at other examples
<br>Use their templates (e.g., informed consent forms)
<br>Ask them questions (but ask your colleagues first)
<br>Describe all study activities (including recruitment and consent)
<br>How are you reducing harm? How are you maintaining confidentiality?
<br>Risks and benefits

<br>Requires careful thought in our research design and our presentation of our results
<br>What are the costs of HARKing?

<br>Type 1 Error
<br>Narrow Theory
<br>Distorted Science

Measurement and Capturing the World Accurately]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>What are the biggest challenges social scientists face when trying capture meaning in the real world? What strategies are helpful to overcoming these strategies?
<br>What is one construct that you are interested in capturing in your research? Thoroughly describe 3 different ways you could capture it in a study (Be creative!!!). How will you determine if your measurement strategy is 1) valid and 2) appropriate for the population you are studying?
<br><br><br>
<br>Why do researchers HARK and/or use their flexibility in their publications?

<br>Significant findings get published
<br>Desire to tell a good story
<br>Hindsight bias
<br>Need for speed


<br>How do we as a field reduce HARKing and problematic use of flexible decisions?

<br>Demand transparency
<br>Change incentive structures
<br>Use of pre-registration to:

<br>Force less flexibility after the data is collected
<br>Allow reviewers to see a priori decisions


<br>Encourage replication
<br>Encourage/mandate data sharing


<br>Ensuring appropriate use of your findings

<br>How can researchers ensure that there is appropriate use of their findings?

<br>Discussion sections
<br>Engaging with media
<br>Not overstating relevance of findings to practice and policy - especially if exploratory work (e.g., not pre-registered, no replications)




<br><br>
<br>Our desire to advocate can cause ethical challenges. 

<br>Harm to particpants (e.g., zone of privacy)
<br>Ways that we present findings and interpret findings


<br>Something to always be aware of and thinking about when making decisions. 
<br><br>
<br>Discuss early and often
<br>Follow professional guidelines (and journal guidelines)

<br><br>
<br>Goal of understanding the world accurately (truth-seeking etc.)
<br>Want valid results

<br>Validity is how we think through likely accuracy of our research
<br>Measurement validity=closeness to the truth; are we capturing the concepts we seek to capture?


<br><br>
<br>How do you decide what measures to capture in a study?

<br>Start with your research question. 


<br>Conceptualization:

<br>What are the concepts we are interested in?
<br>How do we define them?
<br>How do we define them in ways that are measurable?

<br>Specific
<br>Able to be captured


<br>Need to do for both objective (e.g., income) and abstract (e.g. happiness)


<br><br>
<br>Operationalization:

<br>The process of developing valid measurement of the variables in a study
<br>E.g., choosing measures for survey developing observation protocols, developing experimental manipulations


<br>Independent Variable

<br>Predictor


<br>Dependent Variable 

<br>Outcome


<br>Control Variable (Covariate)

<br>We think they matter for both the predictor and outcome. We want to make sure the associations we are looking at are not just 


<br>Moderating Variable (Changes the association you are looking at)
<br>Mediating Variable (Process)
<br>Need to conceptualize and operationalize all of these variables in advance. 
<br><br>
<br>Goal is to use measures that are reliable and valid

<br>Look to theory for help with conceptualization 
<br>Look to prior empirical research for help with measure selection


<br>When possible, choose measures for which reliability and validity has already been established. 

<br>However, you will still need to demonstrate this within the sample you collect/use.


<br><br>
<br>Measures cannot be valid if they are not reliable. 
<br>Reliability:

<br>Degree to which a measure produces a consistent answer when the phenomenon being studied is not changing


<br>Test-Retest
<br>Internal Consistency
<br>Interrater Reliability
<br>You should be prepared to report on internal consistency and interrater reliability within your own research. 
<br>Reliability lets you know if you are capturing something meaningful, but not if it is what you are intending to capture. 
<br><br>
<br>Are we capturing what we want to be capturing?

<br>Capturing psychological constructs is really hard. 

<br>Harder than a lot of constructs in physical sciences. 
<br>How can we capture constructs better?

<br>Use multiple measures (Kagan)

<br>Natural Observations
<br>Self-Reports
<br>Physiological
<br>Other Reporters
<br>Lab Tasks






<br>Challenges of multiple measures
<br>Lack of correlation

<br>Multiple reasons:

<br>Role of context
<br>Individual perceptions


<br>Brings complications, but can brings us closer to truth
<br>Lorenz and the multitrait model
<br>Think about Venn dyagrams and where shared and unique variance comes from


<br><br><br>
<br>Just because a measure works for one group of people does not mean it will work for another. 

<br>Huge problem in our field. 


<br>Choose measures that have been shown to be valid in populations you are studying. 
<br>Use measurement invariance testing to make sure the measures are working for subgroups in your population.

<br>Reliability

<br>Reliability lets you know if you are capturing something meaningful, but not if it is what you are intending to capture. 
<br><br>
<br>Face Validity

<br>Does a test measure what it's supposed to measure?


<br>Content Validity

<br>Assess whether a test is representative of all aspects of the construct


<br>Criterion Validity

<br>Evaluates how accurately a test measures the outcome it was designed to measure


<br>Discriminant Validity

<br>Measures whether constructs that theoretically should not be related to each other are, in fact, unrelated. 


<br><br>
<br>The measures we choose will eventually become the variables in our statistical analyses
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Continuous Variable" data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous</a>

<br>Variable can assume an infinite number of real values within a given interval (e.g., income)


<br>Count

<br>Individual piece of count data (e.g., number of kids)


<br>Ordinal

<br>Categorical variables with ordered possible values; ratings about opinions or perceptions, or demographic factors that are categorized into levels or brackets


<br>Categorical

<br>Dichotomous - only 2 categories (e.g., employed or not)
<br>Characteristic that can't be quantifiable


<br>Always measure things with as much precision as possible
<br>If possible, measure things continuously

<br>You can always collapse things into categories later. (e.g., age [use birthday and day of assessment], hours worked per week [can make part-time/full-time later])


<br>Descriptive Statistics

<br>Want to understand your data
<br>Check for variability
<br>Check for normality
<br>Check for unusual data (e.g., bots)
<br>Check for outliers

<br>Have plan ready in advance


<br>Look at reliability statistics
<br>Look at associations among independent variables

<br>Is a latent variable warranted? (unmeasured variables that is believes to influence responses to a number of survey items)


<br>Do not look at associations (even correlations) among independent variables and dependent variables (HARKing)


<br><br>
<br>Qualitative research also needs to demonstrate rigor. 

<br>Looks very different
<br>Validity is about ensuring appropriate conclusions are drawn - based on what informants provide and theoretical lens being used
<br>Rigor occurs throughout the research process, not just at the beginning or the end (also true for quantitative work)


<br>Role of verification
<br><br>
<br>Role of verification

<br>Iterative process between the data and the literature


<br>Responsiveness

<br>Requires knowing your data, knowing how to listen, and knowing how to synthesize
<br>Flexible in way of processing data


<br>Sampling

<br>Saturation
<br>Seeking negative cases


<br>Audit trails
<br>Member checks
<br><br>
<br>You need to demonstrate how your data or data collection plan is valid. 
<br>Quantitative studies: reliability and validity; prior studies; how does this measure capture the constructs you are talking about in your literature review and research questions?
<br>Qualitative studies: What steps are you taking to ensure rigor?
<br><br><br>
<br>The literature review/introduction will direction follow your opening 2-3 paragraphs. 
<br>Goal is to explain the rationale for the work you are doing. 

<br>Not to comprehensively summarize every related study ever
<br>Show your work builds off of prior theory and empirical work
<br>Highlight the unique contributions of your work


<br><br>
<br>Although you may not review every related study, you need to do a thorough literature review to understand how your study relates to others and how your study fits. 

<br>Focus on peer-reviewed journal articles
<br>Try to get a sense of paper by looking at abstract and skimming before committing to fully reading


<br>To do this more effectively, you should plan out the sections of your literature review in advance
<br><br>
<br>Based on your questions
<br>Provide an organization/headings for your literature review
<br>Your questions may be a series of questions (each will become a header in your literature review/introduction)
<br>Or your questions may build upon each other
<br><br>
<br>Your sequential logic becomes the headers for your introduction
<br>And it ensures that you know the 'argument' for each section (because you have the arrows drawn and connections made already)

<br>Note: your argument does not mean you ignore findings that don't support your hypothesis - you use them as arguments as to why your research is needed. 


<br>Ultimately, should match your first 2/3 paragraphs, methods, results, and discussion. 
<br><br>
<br>Keep your headings general and big picture
<br>Consider ending with a, 'The present study...' section
<br>May have to include a conceptual or theoretical paragraph somewhere

<br>Often easier to discuss theory within your aims-based headings


<br>Try not to use jargon, simple words instead
<br>Do not repeat yourself even if it is written in a different way (e.g., put another way)
<br>Do not provide laundry list of extant literature; instead, synthesize
<br><br>
<br>What is it? Is it attainable?
<br>Think about research you have read recently? Do you think they have adequately discussed generalizability?
<br>Big takeaways:

<br>Being as thoughtful as possible about our sampling plan before collecting data is going to help us create higher quality research. 
<br>Be transparent about the ways in which your research is or is not generalizable. 
<br>Getting good samples is really hard. Your research doesn't have to be perfect (remember no study is).


<br>Sample Generalizability:

<br>Can findings based on a sample be applied to the larger population from which the sample was drawn?
<br>Need for 'thick description'


<br>Cross-Population Generalizability

<br>Can findings from a study of one population be applied ot other populations?
<br>Usually infers in universality (although doesn't have to)


<br><br>
<br>Sampling is unnecessary if all the units in the population are identical (e.g., blood)
<br>But what about people?

<br>Are fundamental psychological processes the same across all people (universal)?


<br><br>
<br>When random sampling is not possible
<br>Availability (Convenience) Sampling:

<br>Take who you can get
<br>Exploratory or qualitative research
<br>Intro to psych!


<br>It is okay to use convenience sampling but you need to be aware of and acknowledging your limitations. 
<br>Quota Sampling:

<br>Make sure sample represents certain characteristics in the population (but can't know all characteristics, and not random)
<br>This is not as good as random/probability sampling but is still a much improved strategy over convenience sampling. 


<br>Purposive Sampling:

<br>Studying a subset of limited group
<br>Studying 'key informants'
<br>High on internal validity


<br><br>
<br>Population:

<br>The entire set of individuals or other entities (e.g., families, schools) to which study findings are to be generalized
<br>Census = study the whole population


<br>Sampling Frame

<br>A list of all the elements in a population


<br>Sample

<br>A subset of a population used to study the population as a whole


<br>Two factors that make it easier to get a representative sample: 

<br>Larger samples are more likely to be representative

<br>Sample size does matter in quantitative research
<br>Both for generalizability and power
<br>However, unthoughtful sampling doesn't improve much with larger samples. 


<br>It is easier to derive a representative sample from a homogenous population (i.e., can have a smaller sample)


<br><br>
<br>Allows us to know in advance how likely it is that any element of a population will be selected.

Studying Diverse Populations]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Cases (individuals, families, etc.) are only selected on the basis of chance
<br>Keep in mind:

<br>You must know the population (your sample frame)
<br>Poor response rates makes your sample nonrandom and thus nonrepresentative


<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Cluster Sampling" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/cluster-sampling.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cluster Sampling</a>:

<br>Random sample of clusters is drawn
<br>Random sample of elements within each selected cluster is draw
<br>At least to stages of sampling
<br>Really helpful for studying populations with large geographic area OR when it is easier to sample from groups (e.g., within classes instead of randomly at OSU)
<br>When cluster sampling is used, sampling weights are also used to make sure the descriptive information of the sample will match that of the population. 


<br><a data-href="Stratified Random Sampling" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/stratified-random-sampling.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stratified Random Sampling</a>:

<br>To ensure that various groups are included in your sample

<br>Proportionate:

<br>Random sampling in direct proportion to groups in population


<br>Disproportionate:

<br>Proportion of each group does not match population
<br>Pros of Disproportionate Sampling

<br>Facilitate group comparisons
<br>Enable the study of within group processes
<br>They still allow for population-level generalizability








<br><br>
<br>Why should we strive for population representative sampling

<br>Importance for policy or practice (We don't want to recommend changes that aren't based on research that is representative of the full population those changes would impact.)


<br>How?

<br>Narrow our populations of interest (e.g., Columbus instead of the US)
<br>Work on large teams
<br>Use secondary data


<br><br>
<br>How do you get a full list of your population

<br>Phone numbers
<br>Addresses


<br>What is your population is subjective? (e.g., likely voterts, experienced trauma) - need to operationalize wel
<br>Really hard to do for large populations with individual-level units
<br>Easier with something like hospitals or schools
<br>Easier to do with more targeted populations (e.g., OSU) but still confidentiality issues
<br><br>
<br>How do you actually reach the individuals that were randomly selected to be sampled?
<br>Who actually is willing to participate?

<br>If participation rates are incredibly low, are our samples still representative?


<br><br>
<br>Who stays in our sample?
<br>Another way that our sample can end up biased in longitudinal work

<br>Generalizability concerns (e.g., what if families experiencing poverty dropout at much higher rates)
<br>Causal validity concerns (e.g., what is the individuals experiencing the most acute depressive symptoms are more likely to leave our study of a new therapy model?)


<br>Are design and statistical ways to reduce the impact of this problem but still needs to be avoided as much as possible. 
<br><br>
<br>You will likely work a lot with quota or convenience sampling in  your quantitative work. That's okay but:

<br>Recognize the limits of your works generalizability
<br>Think about the balance across types of validity
<br>See if there are representative samples available to use to answer your questions

<br>Pair multiple datasets (e.g., a representative secondary dataset with less great measurement with a datasetr you collect with great measurement)<br>
What do we learn across studies?




<br>Again, the goal is to do valid, high quality research and to be transparent about how the strengths and limitations of our work shape its contributions to our knowledge and understanding of the world. 
<br>Aim for the best sampling plan, but recognize it may not happen immediately. 
<br>Putting your sampling plan into a pre-registration that details your target population (even if not random sampling), planned sample size, and strategies for recruitment helps you establish a solid plan. 

<br>Talk to others who do similar research. How do they find participants?

<br>Diversifying our samples is not enough; we need to think critically about how our work (and our methods) acknowledge/incorporate/ignore systems of power and oppression in the world
<br><br>
<br>Placing onus on individuals or groups rather than structures and environment
<br>Moving beyond disparities to what creates these disparities
<br>Thinking about strengths-based approaches
<br><br>
<br>Should we control for things like race, gender identity, immigration status?

<br>Within-group analyses ideal
<br>Using moderation to understand key processes also ideal
<br>When not available, controlling for these things is another option, but need to think through and justify why or why not


<br><br>
<br>What is structural racism?

<br>Moving beyond the individual
<br>Policies, lived environments, etc. 


<br><br>
<br>Individuals hold multiple identities
<br>Commonly examined in qualitative work, but important for quantitative research as well
<br>Key principle:

<br>Cannot simply add up the experiences of multiple marginalized identities - need to understand the complex ways in which multiple identities shape experiences


<br><br>
<br>Between Group

<br>Default comparison group
<br>Inability to look at how processes vary across groups
<br>Assume homogeneity


<br>Within Group

<br>Highlight unique processes within groups
<br>Allow for examination of heterogeneity within a population


<br><br>
<br>Measurement invariance

<br>Do measures operate in the same way for different groups of people?


<br>Easy to test statistically in a latent framework

<br>Do items hang together the same way? (reliability)
<br>Does the measure have the same construct and discriminant validity?


<br>If we don't ensure our measures are appropriate for the participants we are studying, we are not going to get closer to truths about the world. 
<br><br>
<br>Understand that your own bias shapes the question
<br>How would answering that question enhance children's lives?
<br>The potential solution (s)
<br><br><br>
<br>Problem focused
<br>What is missing that we must go find?
<br>Leads to depression, dysfunction, and learned helplessness
<br><br>
<br>Opportunity focused
<br>What is present that can be leveraged and build on?
<br>Leads to innovation and meeting the needs of the community. 
<br><br>
<br>Acknowledign your positionality

<br>Researcher
<br>Other identities


<br>Building relationships with organizations, community laders, and community members
<br>Identifying your sample

<br>Based on the literature about that sample
<br>With deedback from community members
<br>Attending to any comparisons within your sample and how you will provide context for them


<br>Ensuring sample is not confounded by race/income

<br>If it is, generalize your findings specifically to the sample study is drawn from


<br>Ensuring sample is representative of the communities being studies
<br>Ensuring that pan-ethic and racial groups effect the heterogeneity

<br>If they do not, address this when discussing your work. 


<br><br>
<br>Research measures should accurately and truthfully capture your data of interest
<br>Use of inappropriate measures can lead to biased findings

<br>Leading to deficit framing of your population


<br>Do not be race 'mute' or 'blind' when choosing measures

<br>Interrogate race when identifying what to measure and how to measure it


<br>Measures should yield equitable data for BIPOC participants
<br>Do your measures allow for your sample's BIPOC, strengths to be highlighted?

<br>If no, you need to re-assess your measurement choice


<br>Reliable and valid for your population

<br>Culturally relevant


<br>What do you do when the measures for your variables of interest do not have reliability or validity estimates for your population?

<br>Identify multiple forms of measure

Casual Validity]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>Correlation does not equal causation. 
<br><br>
<br>Rule out other explanations. 
<br>Make sure timing works (cause happens before effect).
<br>Is there a plausible mechanism?
<br><br>
<br>Causality can only be inferred from research design. 
<br>Statistical significance does not mean causality. 
<br>No statistical analysis alone can lead to causal findings. 

<br>Needs to be in combination with appropriate research design. 


<br><br>
<br>Self-selection
<br>Endogeneity

<br>Third variables
<br>Common cause
<br>Omitted variables 


<br><br>
<br>Randomized Experiments/Randomized Control Trials

<br>Best causal validity (when done right)
<br>Still have to work about equivalence and artifacts


<br>Natural Experiments/Quasi-Experiments

<br>Have exogeneity which provides some causal validity
<br>But still have to rule out alternate explanations


<br>Observational Designs

<br>Observational = no external agent causing change like in an experiment or quasi-experiment
<br>Are NOT causal!

<br>But we can take steps to rule out alternative explanations, which brings us closer to causal validity




<br><br>
<br>How do RCTs get around 3 rd variable problem?

<br>Random assignment
<br>Ensures that charactertistics of the individuals (or families, schools, etc.) are not related to your independent variable (treatment)
<br>So, the relationship between your treatment and your outcome (dependent variable) is not influence by 3 rd variables

<br>Randomized is the method to get causal estimates




<br><br>
<br>Randomization ensures that your treatment is independent from characteristics of your sample/3 rd variables but not that the treatment group and control group are equivalent

<br>In large numbers, they usually are.


<br>Need to check for statistical equivalence - also known as baseline equivalence
<br><br>
<br>Artifacts are issues that can arise in RCTs that may bias your results and reduce your ability to make causal statements
<br>Hawthorn Effect

<br>Individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed


<br>Placebo Effect

<br>A substance that has no therapeutic effect, used as a control


<br>Contamination

<br>When the members of one group in a trial receive the treatment or are exposed to the intervention that is meant for the other group. The result is a minimization of any real difference that exists between the groups. 


<br>Demoralization

<br>Issue in which those in the control group become resentful of not receiving the experimental treatment. 


<br>Non-Compliance

<br>Any failure to adhere to requirements for conducting research that may reasonably be regarded as presenting a genuine risk of substantive harm to the safety, rights, or welfare of human research participants. 


<br>Attrition

<br>Loss of study units from a sample; the selective dropout of some participants who systematically differ from those who remain in the study

<br>Something occurs outside of researcher control that leads to pseudo-randomization

<br>Casino opening
<br>Laws changing
<br>Airports closing


<br>Provide plausible exogeneity (the change is unrelated to characteristics of those treated or untreated)
<br>Need to check for artifacts as in random controlled trials

<br>Plus other potential biases
<br>Other things changing, hidden 3rd variable problems. 


<br><br>
<br>Are similar to natural experiments but often involve more researcher intervention. (Quantify what determines how to give treatment)
<br>Regression discontinuity

<br>Does going to kindergarten shape behavioral and brain development?
<br>Key is that the assignment variable (e.g., cutoff) is quantifiable. 


<br>Instrumental variables
<br>Matching techniques

<br>Choosing an appropriate comparison group


<br>These are not fully causal but provide better approximations than most. 
<br><br>
<br>Most common quantitative approach in HDFS
<br>Some things are hard/unethical to randomly assignment and not likely to occur in natural experiment design. 
<br>But they are always suspect to 3rd variables (hence not causal)
<br>How do we improve causal validity in observational designed

<br>Establish time ordering
<br>Have a plausible mechanism
<br>Rule out 3rd variables using covariates


<br>How do we choose 3 rd variables to rule out?

<br>The influence of attending a private school (as compared to public) on reading achievement
<br>The influence of financial security on relationship quality


<br>Control variables need to be carefully planned out based on your research question and plausible 3rd variables. 
<br>Need to be planned out in advance so that:

<br>You actually collect them
<br>You don't fall suspect to p-hacking


<br>Use of proxies as covariates
<br>Don't use mechanisms as covariates
<br><br>
<br>Statistical significance helps us rule out chance as a reason for any associations we find in our studies (random controlled trials or observational)

<br>But doesn't establish causality


<br>Confidence intervals provide more information
<br>Remember, causality does not mean certainty

<br>Probabilistic nature of social science


<br><br>
<br>Randomized Experiments/Randomized 
<br><br>
<br>Length of overall study
<br>Frequency of follow-ups

<br>How intense are follow-ups?

<br>Phone, lab?
<br>Long, short?
<br>Emotional draining?




<br>Match to theory and your conceptualization

<br>But recognize practical limitations and tradeoffs.

<br>Three reasons you should care about data management:

<br>Federal funders are moving to requiring a data management plan
<br>You need to share your data when the grant is over

<br>You'll need a plan that will have your data ready to share publicly by the time you're done.


<br>Science is more interesting when it's true:

<br>Data management makes your data and your conclusions more accurate.




<br>Some researchers are very uncomfortable with data sharing. 

<br>They make 3 basic arguments:

<br>It was my idea to collect these data. 
<br>I did all the work
<br>It's against the ethos of science




<br>This will be required for federal grants:

<br>Data should be owned by the public that funded it
<br>Allows data to have a wider reach
<br>Makes sharing with other authors easier
<br>Keeps data archived and accessible long-term


<br><br>
<br>The Inter-University consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
<br>Lots of resouirces on how to share
<br>Good confidentiality and maintenance policies
<br>OSU already pays for a site license so it is free
<br><br><br>
<br>Where you're going is dependent on collecting good information.
<br>Important to have analyses in mind when choosing what to collect
<br>Be thoughtful of how you present and word questions to your participants. 

<br>Make sure your instructions are clear.


<br>One of the first things you have to do is select measures. 
<br>You can't answer a question you haven't measured on your participants. 
<br>It is important to select ones that reliably and validly measure what you want to know. 
<br>Document everything. 

<br>It is hard to remember what you measured, when you measured it, or why you measured it. Your best defense is well documented protocols, a good codebook, documentation of what all of your variable names mean. 


<br><br>
<br>Key to success with any project is writing things down. 
<br>Future you won't remember what current you decides to do today, or why you decided to do it. 
<br>Protocols are written documentation of the decisions you make when designing your data collection. 
<br>They are living documents that should be continuously updated. 
<br>They have two important points:

<br>The decision made

<br>Document who made the decision and when
<br>The decision is a rule to be implemented across the project


<br>A rationale for why the decision was made. 


<br><br>
<br>Think about someone else using your data later, and what they will need to know. 
<br>Every project has at least two investigators:

<br>You
<br>Future you


<br><br>
<br>Inclusionary criteria for participants
<br>Recruitment procedures
<br>Assessment administration
<br>Training of project staff
<br>Communication with participants
<br>ID schemes
<br>Protocol Example:
<br><br><br>
<br>Can convey lots of information (but doesn't have to)
<br>Most important thing is that you make a rule and don't change
<br>Once a participant has an ID don't change
<br>Don't change it
<br>We always have a protocol for:

<br>What an ID looks like
<br>When an ID gets assigned
<br><img alt="Dataset ID Example.png" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/dataset-id-example.png">


<br><br>
<br>The shortened digital representation of each variable in your dataset

<br>Column names


<br>Important that all variable names are unique
<br>Variable names follow a rule:

<br>Develop a naming convention for yourself
<br>Be consistent across datasets (and projects if possible)
<br>For item level data, always put the number of the item LAST. 
<br>Global variable naming protocol:

<br>XXXX#YYY or PPVT1001

<br>X: Short Survey / Scale
<br>#: Timepoint
<br>Y: Unique Identifier




<br>You can make your own rule, but make sure you document them. 
<br>Don't change them.


<br><br>
<br>A codebook is a key translating what you give participants into the data you store. 
<br>Necessary to link between the items given and the variables in your database. 
<br>Makes interpretation and analysis easier later. 
<br><br>
<br>Variable values follow similar rules
<br>Keep them consistent across your project
<br>Document them in the codebook
<br>Think about someone else using your data later, and what they will need to know. 
<br>Hack:

<br>If you have a dichotomous variables, don't name it after the construct.
<br>Name it after a category, such that 1 = yes or has that attribute. 

<br>For the question: Is your house green or red? (Bad: 'HouseColor'; Good: 'HouseGreen')


<br>With multiple response questions, make sure the order of options makes sense. (Bad: '-20k, 10k, &lt;10k, &gt;20k'; Better: -&lt;10k, 10k, 20k, &gt;20k)


<br><br>
<br>Tracking your participants (master list, consort, change form)
<br>Tracking data collection (on the fly messiness, scheduled and completing data)
<br><br>
<br>A master list is a list of every person the project touches. 
<br>You may have a sub-master-list, which contains only those participants who you have assigned an ID. 

<br>How do you determine who gets an ID?
<br>You make a decision and you write it down and you don't change it. 


<br>The master list is a living document from which nothing should ever be deleted
<br>Contains basic demographic and contact information
<br>This is the lifeblood of the project - how you determine who needs to be assessed and when
<br>All information in the master file needs to be stored as letters or numbers
<br><br>
<br>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
<br>Primarily concerned with RCTs
<br>Consort's diagram is a useful framework for documenting your study.

<br><br>
<br>Participants in studies are transient. 
<br>Keeping track of movement of participants is important. 
<br>You can keep track of this in multiple ways:

<br>The Master List
<br>A separate excel log
<br>A form or digital form


<br><br><br>
<br>Backing up your data is one of the most essential steps in data processing. 

<br>This may mean scanning or copying paper data or a more sophisticated digital system. 


<br>Try to make sure that your department/university has a file server. 

<br>Shared drive


<br>Allow for multiple computers to access the same datafiles. 
<br>Easier to set back-ups. 
<br><br>
<br>Every data set has some problems. If you don't think you have data problem, then you haven't looked at it yet. 
<br>Data needs to be cleaned to be used meaningfully. Be flexible because data cleaning is hard. 
<br>Avoid manually-entered questions. 
<br><br>
<br>Create an organizational system for the data files. 
<br>Create a system for tracking issues and resolutions (codebook/protocol)
<br>Ensure variables and values match those in the codebook
<br>Run descriptives on key variables/calculated scores
<br>Do the means make sense across ages/grades/timepoints?
<br>Eyeball the data
<br>Compare actual data capture to data in database

<br>Final inclusion of SSRS in Released Publishable Database:<br>
- Total scores and standards scores<br>
- For each of the two subscales<br>
- At each of the three time-points<br>
- For each of the two raters (parents and teachers)<br>
<img alt="Codebook Example 3.webp" src="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/lib/media/codebook-example-3.webp">
<br><br>
<br>After final dataset is made, never touch it again. 
<br>Make a copy of the final, clean dataset. Store it somewhere separate as backup.

(Denscombe, 2010, p. 17)<br>“the purpose of the research is something that needs to be understood concisely, precisely and right from the beginning.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)<br>“a clear vision of the purpose of research provides a crucial basis for evaluating the research” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)<br>“This allows readers to evaluate the research by providing benchmarks against which to judge the extent to which the research has been successful.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)<br>“a clear vision of the purpose of research provides a good platform from which to conduct the investigation. This applies whether the research uses a quantitative, a qualitative, or a mixed methods approach” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)<br>“Clarity of purpose also calls on the researcher to identify a relatively narrow and precise area for investigation rather than setting out to investigate some general area of interest. It requires the researcher to focus attention on specific aspects, specific questions, specific issues within the broader area of interest.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)<br>“unless some quite specific topic is pinpointed, there is the very real danger that: • researchers will ‘bite off more than they can chew’; • researchers will flounder in a sea of vast quantities of issues and data; • time will be wasted on the collection of unnecessary information; • time will be wasted on meanderings up blind alleys before a clear direction becomes evident; • vague questions might lead to vague answers.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 22)<br>“Social research questions must be, in principle, testable. Explanations and theories must be open to proof or disproof” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)<br>“The research should also offer something new.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)<br>“The literature review is particularly important” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)<br>“To offer something new or different, the research needs to build on existing knowledge and link to what is already known on a particular topic or issue.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 23)<br>“Good research avoids the pitfall of being over-ambitious in terms of its scale and its scope.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)<br>“it is essential that the research does not set out to do something that is illegal or immoral.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)<br>“the project researcher should ensure that his/her activities accord with ethical standards and codes of conduct that operate for the discipline, the profession and the country in which the research is located.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)<br>“descriptive research, which provides detailed accounts of events or situations in order to gain a clearer picture of what is going on.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)<br>“explanatory research, which is mainly concerned with cause–effect relationships. It builds on well-established theories with a view to developing them and using them to make predictions that can be tested. It aims to explain why things happen.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)<br>“exploratory research, which investigates new areas and which seeks to generate new theories and concepts.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 24)<br>“The rights and interests of participants and others directly affected by the research will be taken into consideration. The research will be conducted in accord with an appropriate code of research ethics. Approval will be sought from a relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. The research will be conducted in an honest, open and transparent manner – as far as it is possible.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)<br>“Ethics refers to the system of moral principles by which individuals can judge their actions as right or wrong, good or bad” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)<br>“researchers need to introduce a moral perspective to the way they design and conduct their investigations.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)<br>“need to consider what will be acceptable in the context of the values of the wider society in which the research is conducted” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 73)<br>“The motivation for researchers to operate ethically should be a matter of professional integrity” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)<br>“‘The acceptability of social research depends increasingly on the willingness of social researchers to accord respect to their subjects and to treat them with consideration.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)<br>“Research that does not do this will damage the reputation of social research” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)<br>“without the good will and trust of the public large parts of social research will become starved of information.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)<br>“Research” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)<br>“must take account of the moral and legal climate of the time and the boundaries this places on the topics of investigation that are deemed acceptable and the nature of the methods of investigation it tolerates.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 74)<br><br>
<br>Ground rule: Research should produce findings from which generalizations can be made.

<br>Either the research is based on a sample of people, events, or data that are representative of the wider population (generalizability).
<br>Or sufficient information is given about the characteristics of the sample or the cases used in the research for judgements to be made about the extend to which findings can be expected to apply more widely (transferability).
<br>Or the people, events, or data included in the research have been chosen because of their particular characteristics and the belief that these characteristics will be helpful for generating and developing theories (theory relevance).


<br>“A generalization involves drawing some conclusion about a whole group or category of things on the basis of information drawn from particular instances or examples. On the basis of what is found to exist in a relatively few instances or examples, propositions are made about the nature and qualities of the whole class.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 195)

<br>“Researchers usually wish to feel confident that their findings have been based on samples that are either representative of, or have particular characteristics that are significant for the analysis of, the broader class of thing being investigated. Another reason centers on the researcher's wish to produce generalized knowledge in the form of theories.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 195-196)

<br>“The concern with generalizations relates to the way findings from specific pieces of research lend themselves to the development of propositions that work very widely – possibly universally – and that contribute to establishing rules or theories about the workings of social phenomena.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)

<br>Continue to be a crucial aspect of good research for all but a small minority of those operating under the umbrella of ‘social research’
<br>Can be justified in different ways depending on the nature of the particular research and its underlying assumptions
<br>Need to be incorporated into the rationale for the research.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)


<br><br>
<br>“the criteria for selection are the crucial starting point when it comes to generalizations.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)
<br>“the selection of the items to be included in the study needs to be done on a logical basis – a basis that allows generalizations from the data to be defended as reasonable and justifiable – and within social research there are broadly two approaches to this matter. One way is to go for a representative sample. This tends to be favored by relatively large-scale survey research using quantitative data and a positivistic approach. The alternative is to select the items for study on the basis of their particular characteristics. Smaller-scale research involving case studies, qualitative data and an interpretivist approach tend to rely on this.” (Denscombe, 2010, p. 196)
<br>Do the findings from the research apply elsewhere?

<br>Have the criteria for selection of the people, events, or data been described and justified?
<br>Reflecting the criteria for selection, have an adequate number and appropriate diversity of people, events, or data been included in the research?
<br>Does the description of the sample or cases used in the research allow comparisons with others of their type?


<br><br>
<br>Research tends to focus on a reduced number of instances of the thing under investigation. It investigates a sample or it investigates specific cases. 

<br>To what extend do the findings from the sample or case apply to other instances that were not included in the study?


<br>To be representative, samples need to:

<br>Cover all relevant types
<br>Have these types in proportion to the volumes found in the whole population


<br>A representative sample includes a balanced cross-section of all of the relevant instances. This justifies generalizing from the findings of the sample. 
<br>To achieve representativeness:

<br>Use of random samples. 

<br>Provided that the units included (people, observations, etc.) in the research are sufficiently large and are chosen on a genuinely random basis, the end result ought to be representative of the total population from which they were drawn. 


<br>There is the selection of samples by quotas. On the basis of attributes of the population which are already known, the researcher can select samples deliberately to include all the relevant types and to cover these types in proportion to their profile in the total population. 


<br>It is not always easy for researchers to obtain a sample that qualifies as 'representative' according to these strict criteria. It demands that we know relevant details about the whole population. 

<br>Social researchers frequently rely on a less stringent version of representativeness in which the principle remains the same but the rigor of selection of the sample is relaxed somewhat. The principle is still that the instances used for the research allow for the findings of the research to be extrapolated to other instances not included in the research. 
<br>The researcher does not claim that the sample necessarily meets all the criteria of representativeness. The claim is that the instances used for research are 'typical'.

<br>The word 'typical' carries with it some notion of being standard, of being normal, of being usual. It suggests that any findings from the sample will apply elsewhere because the instances included in the sample have no particularly unusual characteristics that mark them out from the rest. 
<br>While claims to conducting research on 'typical' instances certainly retain the need to identify key features relevant to the investigation, the sample might not include all of the relevant categories. 
<br>The claim to generalizability, however, persists through the emphasis on: 

<br>Including the main type
<br>Achieving some balance of the numbers in each category






<br><br>
<br>A case study approach is used when a researcher's focus is on a limited number of instances. 

<br>Researchers can make the strategic decision to concentrate their investigation on one or a few cases in order to allow greater depth to their research, more attention to the dynamics of the situation, better insights that come from a detailed knowledge and understanding of a specific example. (Qualitative researchers favor this strategy)
<br>Example:

<br>There is almost no chance of getting a sample that is large enough and widespread enough to satisfy the criteria for being representative, in a statistical sense, of the whole 'population.' 

<br>The selection tends to rely on a more purposeful process in which examples are chosen for their particular qualities, as opposed to being chosen with no regard for their individual traits (random) or being chosen with respect to some general category (quota).






<br>There are 4 grounds on which cases might be chosen to reflect their particular qualities:

<br>Researchers can justify generalizations from their case study (or small sample) if they can establish that the instance included in the research was typical of other instances. 

<br>The basis for the generalization is that whatever was found in the one instance actually studies was likely to appear in other instances because there was nothing unusual, nothing special, about the case that was investigated. 


<br>Social researchers can opt to focus on instances that are anything but representative or typical. 'Extreme' instances may be selected deliberately because they have certain qualities that exaggerate the influence of a particular factor that is of interest to the researchers. 

<br>Things might be visible in these circumstances simply because the situation is extreme or special, and that these might be impossible to detect in more 'watered down' instances. Things become visible here that would remain hidden under typical circumstances. (It can suggest the way things might develop if typical instances start to shift towards the special or extreme. The special/extreme example might act to alert is to factors that would otherwise have remained hidden under the typical circumstances. What was detected in the extreme instance should be looked for in the typical.)


<br>Researchers might decide to focus on instances which would appear to present a least likely scenario in terms of the theory or proposition they are investigating. 

<br>Following the commitment to testing theories to destruction and challenging existing theories or suppositions through attempting to 'falsify' them, there is clear logic to choosing instances that might be expected to 'go against the grain' and prove the theory wrong. 


<br>The selection of a case might reflect the fact that it constitutes an event or situation that is a special case - a one-off or extremely rare occurrence. 

<br>It is almost certain that such events or situations are beyond the control of the researcher in the sense that he or she could not organize for them to happen, as in an experiment. The timing and the location of the event will be something to which the researcher responds rather than initiates. 




<br><br>
<br>The degree to which the findings from the small number of events or cases being studies might be expected to apply elsewhere can be addressed by comparing and contrasting the nature of the specific units of study with the broader population of such units that exist. 
<br>The selection of instances for research can be based on their usefulness in terms of the contrast they offer with other instances chosen to be included in the research. The researcher can deliberately set out to select examples that provide a stark contrast with one another and that represent the widest variation possible within the thing being studied. 

<br>Choosing them to achieve a maximum variation allows the research to use the comparative method, controlling for key variables such as size and location, to see what other factors might appear to be linked with these. 


<br>Selection on the basis of comparison can be useful:

<br>It can allow an element of 'triangulation' between alternatives. The researcher is able to see how a certain thing works in two or more very different settings. 
<br>It is useful where the research design is emergent. Where the researcher selects cases as part of an unfolding path of discovery, then the idea that has emerged from the one example can be compared with the next sample, which might be consciously chosen as one that is different.

Reaction Papers]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>To develop your writing and critical thinking skills, both of which are essential for success in  graduate school and beyond, you will be turning in weekly reaction papers. These papers will be  written in response to the readings for that week. What should you talk about in your reaction papers? 
<br>The papers should be a comment on the theory and research for that week. It can be an idea for further research or theory, a new way of applying one of the articles, a criticism, or an integration or comparison between two or more articles. 
<br>Do not summarize. I have read the articles already. In these papers I am expecting you to come up with an original idea that in some way extends our understanding of the topic. At the end of each reaction paper, you should pose at least one discussion question. Some considerations when posing your questions: 

<br>Your question should be related to the thought/reflection that you develop (i.e., provide a rationale for asking the question)—I am as interested in your thought processes as I am in the question itself. If you question the methodology of a particular study, be sure you are clear as to why there may be a methodological problem.
<br>Possible answers the question; (i.e., Don’t ask rhetorical questions and try to ask questions that go beyond the material); 3.) 
<br>Avoid asking the same questions every week; 4.) Be sure the question is discussable.  


<br>Papers should be about 2 pages, double-spaced. 
<br>You are required to turn in 11 reaction papers, but you will have opportunity to write one for 13 weeks. I will take the 11 highest grades.  
<br>You will upload your paper to Carmen by 11:59pm the Tuesday before class—this will allow time for me and your classmates (see below) to integrate your questions into the presentation and discussion for a give article.

 <br>
<br>Theory is a creative process of moving from observation to theory. 

<br>Use imagination, experience, literature, or intuition to generate theory
<br>Use justification to provide logical account connecting observation to theory


<br>Interplay between all three—starts with abduction to generate and develop theory, then deduction to develop/test theory – induction helps make sense of testing theory.

<br>Based on observed changes across countries throughout the world that are experiencing different paces of industrialization (things like the industrial revolutions, advances in germ theory, access to clean water, hygiene, food availability, and wars)
<br>Good summary:

<br>This is a state of high birth and death rates culminating in low population growth overall.
<br>With a consistently high birth rate and decreasing death rate, population growth surges.
<br>As the birth rate falls and the death rate remains low, the population continues to increase.
<br>Traditionally considered to be the final stage, this is one of demographic stabilization, in which both birth and death rates are low. This means that the overall population stays fairly low.
<br>This final, contested stage may predict higher or lower fertility levels depending on which theorist you ask.

 <br>
<br>The Institute for Population Research &amp; Census are examples of what demographers do.
<br>May sound familiar as you often need to include “demographics” in your research projects.
<br>Traditionally defined as studying three population processes, fertility, mortality, and migrations. 

<br>More modern conceptualizations are social demography that seek to study population processes that may not fully align with these big three (e.g., Family Demography is a big field).


<br>Family Demography typically two types of studies:

<br>Careful tracking and measurement of families at either a given time point or trends over time. 
<br>Focus on the social, cultural, and economic correlates, precursors, and consequences of family structure and transitions.

<br>A theoretical concept like family cohesion in a contextual theory might appear in a hypothesis as a set of survey questions about how close people in a family feel to one another, in a narrative description as an informant’s story about family celebrations, or in an empirical generalization as the frequency of family meals.

<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Every theory we discuss is limited in some way because it presents a particular way of view the world or a particular phenomenon.&nbsp; 
<br>Assumptions of the theory help us understand the limitations or boundaries of a particular theory.

<br>Examples: 

<br>Economic and exchange theories

<br>Assume that all behavior is reducible to rewards/costs of behavioral exchanges. 


<br>Attachment theory (<a data-href="Attachment Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/attachment-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attachment Theory</a>)

<br>Assumes that our template for socializing with people can be primarily explained by the relationship with have with a primary attachment figure. 


<br>Family Systems Theory (<a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a>)

<br>Assumes all behaviors are linked to the larger social unit of analysis. While each of these are partly true, not every interaction we have in a relationship is rationale (e.g., Exchange theory: sometimes we make costly decisions in a relationship even when we know another behavior my help the relationship are we more motivated for ourselves or the relationship?


<br>Attachment theory

<br>Although our relationship with primary caregivers are important in childhood, attachment theory doesn’t necessarily deal with genetic, personality, or environmental constraints/affordances that can shape these relationships; Family systems: although family dynamics are powerful, where is the role of autonomy and self-efficacy that can explain shifts away from embedded family norms and patterns of behaviors?)






<br><br>
<br>Concepts are the key features of a theory. 
<br>These are the ideas/concepts (often variables) that we measure and focus on when we think of theory. 

<br>For example, if you were interested in conducting a study around (social exchange, attachment, or family systems theory) what would you potentially be interested in measuring in your study? – give an example if none come up). 
<br>Exactly, concepts are the ideas/constructs that allow us to think/apply the theory to something we are interested in studying.


<br><br>
<br>These are the hypotheses based on the assumptions and constructs in a given theory.

<br>For example, one proposition we might pull from social exchange theory is that in a relationship, when potential alternatives (e.g., other partners) seem more rewarding than our current relationships, we could expect someone might choose to end the relationship or cheat. 
<br>For attachment theory, we could hypothesize that when someone is high in the anxiety dimension of attachment, they might seem more reassurance from their partner than someone lower in anxiety. For family systems, we could hypothesize that when families have rigid boundaries, it may be harder to intervene and change a child’s problematic behavior than if the family had less rigid boundaries.


<br><br>
<br>Ontology = ways of being

<br>The world is knowable, but the focus is on the mechanism that governs people within social structures.

<br>Throughout the semester, we will talk about theories that are grand/abstract/critical—they present a big picture way of viewing the world. To mid-range or lower-range theories that attempt to explain and provide specific hypotheses about families or specific family behaviors/outcomes. 

<br>This idea is helpful to keep in mind as not all theories are well-suited for every level of analysis. 
<br>Some theories may be better suited for certain methodologies than others.

<br>Contextual Theory

<br>Connects abstract theory to the real world. (This is the world we primarily work in as family scientists).
<br>These are more testable theories.

<br>A theoretical concept like family cohesion in a contextual theory might appear in a hypothesis as a set of survey questions about how close people in a family feel to one another, in a narrative description as an informant’s story about family celebrations, or in an empirical generalization as the frequency of family meals. 
<br>Descriptive statements are more about observable/measurable concepts.

<br>Theory is a creative process of moving from observation to theory. 


<br>Use imagination, experience, literature, or intuition to generate theory
<br>Use justification to provide logical account connecting observation to theory


<br>Interplay between all three—starts with abduction to generate and develop theory, then deduction to develop/test theory – induction helps make sense of testing theory.

<br>Theory could be deductive or inductive by to research to falsify the theory. The theory is only true because it has not been falsified. The more it holds up, the more we can be confident it’s a reliable theory.

<br>Multiple frameworks operate simultaneously, but also within each framework, there is a ”normal science” paradigm for each theory within sub-disciplines.

<br>Give examples—spanking research by Liz Gershoff, minority vs minoritized


<br><br>
<br>Using contextual theory, fam scientists have integrated multiple philosophies (e.g., the uncertainty of measurement conceptualized through alphas and p-values to inform falsification/hypothesis testing).

<br>Also, family scientists are skeptics that many concepts are made up and can never know if they fully match Reality.
<br>Also use operationalization (logical empiricists) to measure concepts while acknowledging that they may imprecisely match theory and observation.
<br>“When it comes to theory testing, most family theorists are aware of the limits of falsification, but within those limits are comfortable employing its procedures. “
<br>“Most family scientists believe in verification, sometimes implicitly using Bayesian concepts of probability, so that our confidence in an abstract or contextual theory increases with additional empirical support.”
<br>“However, family scientists believe that an accumulation of differently flawed observations can begin to approximate the boundaries of Reality. “


<br>“Family scientists are mostly reasonable realists who anticipate that there is probably a “Real World” out there; we really do believe there are families. However, we also recognize that there are many distinct but overlapping perspectives (frameworks) from which family life can be multiple and simultaneously understood. “
<br>“Family scientists are reasonable skeptics who recognize that many, if not most, of our concepts are made up from our imaginations, and that we will never know how much—or if—they match Reality.”

<br>“Supernatural explanations for disease, divine spheres for planetary motion, falling objects seeking their proper place, and the “invisible hand” of economics were replaced by germs, gravity, and individual preference schedules do . Why people think they are ill, where a falling object “wants” to be: these sorts of meaning-based explanations are no longer proposed. In these historical cases, meaning explanations have been replaced by causal explanations.


<br>“In the end, both realists and skeptics agree that there are limits to what we can know, so whether improved explanations are closer to Truth as realists claim or more useful as practical understanding as skeptics claim, it doesn’t actually make a difference in what we do with our explanations. “
<br><br>
<br>Who defines the concepts? How often do we reevaluate the theoretical frameworks that outline our understanding of families?
<br>How might theoretical frameworks help control the ways in which family life is defined and understood within research? Thoughts about theory as described through metaphor? Is our ability to describe theory through metaphor a signal of the utility/practicality of a theory?
<br>Will family science have its Newton, who will create a new, grand theoretical framework to replace all the current ones? Coleman (1990) –would it be useful to have a grand theory of family dynamics?
<br>What might be some examples of the “challenge of meaning” in HDFS/family science/ your own area?

<br>The Institute for Population Research &amp; Census are examples of what demographers do.
<br>May sound familiar as you often need to include “demographics” in your research projects.
<br>Traditionally defined as studying three population processes, fertility, mortality, and migrations. 

<br>More modern conceptualizations are social demography that seek to study population processes that may not fully align with these big three (e.g., Family Demography is a big field).


<br>Family Demography typically two types of studies:

<br>Careful tracking and measurement of families at either a given time point or trends over time. 
<br>Focus on the social, cultural, and economic correlates, precursors, and consequences of family structure and transitions. 


<br><br>
<br>“Diverging Destinies” framework, articulated by McLanahan (2004), indicates that families are increasingly dissimilar across social class lines, often proxied by educational attainment.
<br>A theme you will notice about a lot of demographic and sociological explanations is that they take an economic or structural approach to understanding families, marriage, child-birth, and development.

<br>Most young people still aspire to marriage, yet current trends suggest a retreat from marriage.
<br>Declining in married adults partly explained by older age at first marriage (delay in marriage) and fewer people getting married (retreat from marriage).

<br>Lower marriage rates for Black Americans (i.e., growing black-white differences in marriage rates). But also true for Hispanic and AINA than White and API women) – Why though?


<br>Those with higher SES more likely be married (true for White and Black women).

<br>May be explained by economic “readiness” the people link to marriage (it has become a luxury good), which is not as available to those without college degrees.
<br>May be explained by marriage market availability and mass incarceration.


<br>Second Demographic Transition and the “singles are coming”
<br>Remarriage and divorce remain common.

<br>Longer time to remarriage for black and Latina women compared to white women.
<br>Highest remarriage rates for higher educational levels


<br>Post-divorce cohabitation may be replacing marriage given the high divorce rate.
<br>Remarriage = more stepfamilies.
<br><br>
<br>Divorce rates increased steadily between 1960 and rates remain high since 1970s, but divorce rates have declined since 1980s (though still historically high). 

<br>May continue to decline as younger adults have lower divorce rates. Paired with older ages of marriage, young adults who marry may also be a select group of more committed people.


<br>Greater divorces rates among older Americans (i.e., 50+) has been called the “<a data-href="Grey Divorce" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/theoretical-perspectives-on-the-family-(hdfs-8820)/key-terms-and-concepts/grey-divorce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grey Divorce</a>”

<br>Largely driven by baby boomers who had high rates of dissolution to begin with.


<br>Divorce is dramatically stratified by education with up to 60% of those without HS or GED getting divorced (isn’t it expensive? And might this contribute to income inequality given that divorce and relationship dissolution is typically costly?).

<br>Smaller educational difference for Black women compared to White women, but overall the differences between White and Black women, Black women’s marriages were more likely to dissolve.


<br>“Since the early 2000s, the relationship between divorce rates and unemployment rates has been negative; that is, when unemployment went down, the divorce rate went up, and when unemployment went up (as during the Great Recession), divorce rates went down”

<br>Small effects
<br>Recessions delayed rather than forgoing divorce.
<br>When men become unemployed when separated, tend to delays divorce.
<br>When in economic straights, may be likely to forgo divorce unless remarriage is on the horizon. 


<br><br>
<br>Marriage may be delayed but people are still not delaying living with intimate partners.
<br>Rates of cohabitation with different gender partner sped up since the 1970s.
<br>Most women cohabitate by there mid-late twenties.

<br>Cohabitation also common among those 50+.
<br>Very common to live with a spouse beforehand.
<br>Marriage or dissolutions following cohabitation within 2-3 years.


<br>Lower likelihood of cohabitation if at least a bachelor’s degree. College-educated women were more likely to transition into marriage from cohabitation than less educated women.
<br>Cohabitation is more of a steppingstone to marriage, especially for the more economically disadvantaged
<br>Decoupling of marriage and childbearing, as evidenced by increase in cohabitation and retreat from marriage.

<br>Increase in non-marital births largely attributed to cohabitating couples.


<br>Cohabitation used to be associated with marital instability, but more recent studies do not show this trend.

<br>Explanations were selection (cohabitators had more positive attitudes towards divorce).
<br>Experiences while cohabiting deterred people from marriage (trial marriage hypothesis).
<br>White women who cohabited were more likely to divorce compared to Black and Mexican American women.
<br>Cohabitation may stabilize remarriage.
<br>Explanation for disappearing cohabitation may be the normative nature of it. Research from other countries supports this idea.


<br><br>
<br>Fertility rates of in US have largely declined since 1970s, with a slight increase between 1990s and 2007, after which they continued to fall – this is the case across racial/ethnic groups.

<br>Decline since 2007 largely due to declines in birth among young women.


<br>Teen births are at an all-time low.
<br>US has higher TFR than most European countries, but still below replacement level fertility.
<br>Great recession reduced fertility somewhat among younger women, but its unclear if this is a termporary or a longer-term effect.
<br>Big decline in fertility for Hispanic immigrants, likely because the recession reduced immigration from Mexico.
<br>Not clear why “Longer term structural changes, especially the decline of manufacturing and construction, also depress fertility; thus fertility rates may be unlikely to rebound soon (Seltzer, 2019).”
<br>Educational differences in children are relatively small, but more educated women tend to have fewer children.

<br>However, recent evidence suggests that fertility rates are increasing among women with advanced degrees.

<br>May be explained by these women's ability to outsource childcare, availability of childcare has increased, and spouses participate more in childcare.\
<br>Women college graduates also delay childbirth.




<br>40% of all births are to unmarried women – also, something like 30% - 50% of pregnancies are unintended

<br>This tends to be more common for women with less than HS degree (also a group that is less likely to get married and more likely to get divorced.)
<br>Non-marital births are increasing for white women, which has contributed to smaller differences in non-marital child birth differences between white/black women.


<br>Multi-partner fertility has increased

<br>14%-25% in general — higher in unmarried families and cohabitating families.
<br>Less associated with martial fertility in stepfamilies and non-marital fertility.


<br>Covid led to a baby “bust.”
<br>Same-gender unions

<br>Somewhere between 500-800k married same gender couples.


<br>Married and cohabitating same-gender couples tend to have higher SES.

<br>More schooling
<br>Both partners employed
<br>Slightly more white
<br>Higher median household income


<br>Male same-gender couples tend to have higher SES (because of patriarchy).
<br>Same-gender couples are less likely to have children (there are many barriers to having children if they aren’t from a previous relationship).

<br>Higher rates of childrearing among female same-gender couples.


<br>Education gradient in child rearing is more dramatic at higher than lower levels of education for same-gender couples (they have fewer children).
<br>“Same-gender couples with children in the home tend to have less education, lower median incomes, and higher poverty rates than different-gender parents despite the fact that same-gender couples as a whole have higher incomes and education than different-gender couples.”

<br>When controlling for relevant factors, children in female same-sex couple households have similar poverty rates as those in different gender households.


<br>"Controlling for education, demographic, marital status, and health measures, lesbian women and gay men are not more likely to be poor than heterosexuals, but bisexual women and men are more likely to be poor (Badgett, 2018).” 

<br>We don’t really understand why bisexual people have poorer outcomes.


<br>Adoption rates are higher among same-gender unions

<br>Still lots of challenges in accessing pathways to parenthood and adoption.


<br>Overall decline in parenthood among same-gender couples.
<br>Greater dissolution among female same-gender couples.

<br>COVID social distancing impacts

<br>Reinforcing relationship hierarchy
<br>Isolate those living alone
<br>More time with cohabitating partners -&gt; relationship breakdown
<br>Most childcare responsibilities for single parents

<br>Less time with parents
<br>Non-coparents parenting more


<br>Expose

<br>Of Polycule to public
<br>To COVID (for large networks)




<br>Yet, following these best practices has the potential to create or reinforce a relationship hierarchy among cohabiting and non-cohabiting partners or further isolate individuals living alone, according to Sheff (2020 b). In addition, more time among cohabiting partners and disagreements about social distancing practices could lead to tensions and relationship breakdown (Sheff, 2020 a). Single parents or parents working at home in particular may need to take on additional childcare responsibilities (Goldberg et al., 2021), potentially leading to less time with partners or non-coparent partners spending more time with children.
<br><a data-href="Queer Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/theory/queer-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Queer Theory</a>

<br>Include members who are not biologically or legally connected, and the queer sexuality when they form relationships with more than one person: disentangle romantic, sexual, and coparenting relationships; and include same-gender partners. 

<br>May openly challenge heteronormative assumptions


<br>Not all relationship styles do this

<br>May prioritize safety




<br>Methods

<br>No discussion of the gender composition of the relationships


<br>Include members who are not biologically or legally connected, and they queer sexuality when they form relationships with more than one person; disentangle romantic, sexual, and coparenting relationships; and include same-gender partners. However, CNM relationships differ in their degree of compliance with and challenges to heteronormativity. For example, some polyamorous parents try to “pass” as monogamous, whereas others come out and actively compel institutions or other people to recognize their families (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2010).
<br><br>
<br>Decreased contact

<br>Connection across distance
<br>Distance from children

<br>Parents with less time with parents tended to not be cisgender women: only one of these seven parents was a cisgender woman or only a biological parent; rather, three were trans or nonbinary, two were cisgender men, and most were a&nbsp; combination of stepparents, nonbiological parents, biological parents, and adoptive parents.
<br>Pandemic may have more of an impact on parent–child relationships when one or more characteristics of parents deviates from the dominant heteronorm of the primary parent (i.e., female, biological).
<br>The children lived with other parents prior to the pandemic, and in others, parents made the decision for children to live with different caregivers such as grandparents or coparents during the pandemic due to risk of exposure (e.g., parent was a frontline worker) or socialization considerations (e.g., the desire to give the child more time with other family members).
<br>"A relationship, shared,&nbsp; a family, we decided it would be good for my kid to spend some time with my ex. Once that happened I have been able to visit my boyfriend twice (after 3 months apart). Both the kid and my ex is happier for the kid being up there.” Hsin-Yi’s account illustrates one way of resolving the desire to see their boyfriend and limit networks of risk exposure while also allowing their child to spend more time with other coparents.




<br>Changing dynamics and configurations at home

<br>More time at home

<br>•This practice of incorporating multiple partners into a living unit could be beneﬁcial in having a “large, robust household” to combat isolation, but also introduced challenges related to sharing space and dividing time among partners. Isabella, a bisexual white polyamorous stepmother to a toddler, elaborated:

<br>Fortunately, even those who discussed the stress of living in close quarters commented on the skills and strengths that they possessed as people who engaged in CNM, which enabled them to effectively communicate about their needs and boundaries.
<br>But one thing polys are pretty good at is sort of working through issues as they arise.”“Several parents spoke to the strengths of their communication and conflict resolution skills.
<br>Another approach to spend more time with partners while avoiding some of the complications of moving everyone into the same house was creating multi-household quarantine pods, which sometimes further challenged heteronormative notions of family through the intentional and collaborative construction of small communities.




<br>Increased parenting responsibility

<br>Significant stress and desire for greater social support.
<br>Support for parents was generally appreciated both by children and co-parents. 




<br>Negotiating risk

<br>For some, this involved a process of pausing and unpausing CNM relationships as participants made decisions about safety and relative risk.
<br>Newly exploring CNM, the pandemic seemed to at least temporarily foreclose the possibility of opening the relationship.
<br>For other participants with established relationships, the labor and thought that went into seeing existing partners appeared to take priority over the work of trying to safely meet new partners.
<br>Others noted their reluctance to meet with new individuals given the politicization of responses to COVID-19.
<br>Perhaps because those in CNM relationships often have significant experience communicating needs and boundaries to partners (including negotiating expectations around safer sex behaviors), many participants mentioned the conversations they have with partners about COVID risk without characterizing them as challenging or conflictual.
<br>Differences in protective measured ended some relationships.


<br><br>
<br>In what ways are boundaries, as discussed by <a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a>, may be limiting to our understanding of CNM relationships? Is this concept limiting to our understanding of this population? Or is this concept purely expansive in our understanding of this relationship type?
<br>During the pandemic, parents had less contact with partners outside of the home and focused more on the children and the biological mother or father of the children. Did the pandemic change the family processes?

<br>Conflict affected child behavior problems through parent-to-child hostility in all family configurations except mother-child hostility in unrelated pairs (stepparents?)
<br>Genes (relatedness, low serotonin)

<br>Anger mediated association between parenting hostility and child health only for those with low serotonin. 


<br>Inclusion of Siblings

<br>Child trauma symptoms is higher when siblings are treated more harshly and more parenting stress; consistent parenting for siblings; older sibling influence of delinquency (bidirectional)


<br>Inclusion of dyadic and triadic processes (e.g., <a data-href="Triangulation" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/triangulation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangulation</a>)
<br>Family-level constructs (e.g., boundary disturbances associated with emotional dysregulation)


<br>Specificity (Identification of moderating factors that suggested for whom or under what conditions associations are salient) ( <a data-href="Moderation" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/moderation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Moderation</a>)

<br>Moderation (e.g., meta-analyses; associations between chronic health condition and sibling well-being - stronger for older siblings and when illness was life-threatening)

<br>Advanced the literature by examining moderators that provided important information regarding participant characteristics, sample features, and research methods. 
<br>The positive association between parents' marital hostility and young adolescents' internalizing problems was significant only when parents' marital cooperation was low (Zhou &amp; Buehler, 2019)


<br>Latent class analyses (e.g., association between child effects and harsh parenting strong for those behaving poorly)
<br>Conceptual distinctions (e.g., everyday conflict vs. <a data-href="Acculturation" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/glossary/cft-keywords/acculturation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acculturation</a> -based conflict)

<br>Importance of time in the study of family processes and child and adolescent well-being. 
<br>Future Directions

<br>Examination of emotion, cognitive, physiological, and behavioral regulation within and between diverse families
<br>Continue research that considers dyadic, triadic, and family-level regulation
<br>Focus on studying and enhancing family strengths and reducing risks

<br>Continue investigations of gender as a moderator


<br>Increased attention to family processes

<br>Family Diversity

<br>More diverse families (e.g., more inclusive definitions of 'family' - same-sex, between-group comparisons, rural AA families, low-income families)


<br>Cultural Adaptations

<br>(e.g., FSM)
<br>Revisioning of these theories (<a data-href="Family Systems Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/family-systems-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Systems Theory</a> to include historical time and choice with racial socialization)




<br>Importance of time in the study of family processes and child and adolescent well-being

<br>Diary Diary Studies

<br>(e.g., self-blame associated with you feeling more anger on days with higher conflict)


<br>Longitudinal Studies

<br>(i.e., growth curves, cross-lagged models)
<br>Identifying developmental periods (e.g., violence during toddler and early childhood associated with IPV at age 23)
<br>Intergenerational association (e.g., accumulation of family conflict across generations)
<br>Changes in family processes (e.g., increased marital conflict associated with children's later disruptive behavior and family conflict in adolescence associated with later youth depressive symptoms)
<br>Reciprocal associations (e.g., child anxiety associated with parental hostility but reverse not true when considering other behaviors; reciprocal association between maternal sensitivity and child emotional regulation)




<br>Strengths in family functioning

<br>Strengths:

<br>Reflected in processes that have the potential to be associated with greater child and youth positive development or fewer (or less severe) developmental difficulties or adjustment problems.

<br>Closeness, support, shared fun




<br>Future directions
<br>Main takeaways

<br>Move beyond markers of child adjustment problems and focus more of positive aspects of well-being (e.g., emotion regulation, healthy sleep, positive affect, positive racial-ethnic identity)
<br>Development and reformulation of conceptual models that account for diversity in families
<br>The importance of studying everyday lives of families was highlighted and research methods like audio recording and daily diaries were crucial in furthering this area
<br>Cross-lagged designs and growth curves were used often
<br>There is a lot of variability both within and between families that needs to be studied.

<br>Individual attributes influence a person's social and economic environments. 


<br>Hardship conditions are expected to affect family functioning and individual adjustment primarily through the economic pressures they generate. The <a data-href="Family Stress Model" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Family Stress Model" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Family Stress Model</a> proposes that economic pressures include (a) unmet material needs involving necessities such as adequate food and clothing, (b) the inability to pay bills or make ends meet, and (c) having to cut back on even necessary expenses (e.g., health insurance and medical care). 
<br>When economic pressures is high, parents are at an increased risk for emotional distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, anger, and alienation) and for behavioral problems (e.g., substance use and antisocial behavior). According to the model, these emotional or behavioral problems predict increased marital conflict and reduced marital warmth, and this process diminishes nurturing and involved parenting.

<br><br>Purpose of Review:<br>
<br>The purpose of this review is to highlight the major advancements in our understanding of consensually nonmonogamous (CNM) relationships—or intimate relationships between three or more people who are non-exclusive sexually and/ or emotionally. We aim to review key insights from research on the benefits (i.e., diversification of need fulfillment) and challenges (i.e., continued stigma) of CNM relationships and how research on CNM highlights some limitations of the existing theories of relationships.<br>
Recent Findings 
<br>The last two decades have seen a trend towards increasing diversity of family structures. Although monogamy remains the most common relationship structure, CNM relationships are increasing in prevalence and in interest to both lay people and researchers. Recent research has begun to uncover novel insights into who is more likely to be drawn to and engage in CNM, how CNM relationships compare to monogamous relationships, and the potential benefits and challenges of engaging in CNM relationships.<br>
Summary 
<br>While people in CNM relationships still experience stigma, for those who desire such relationships, CNM can be a viable and healthy alternative to monogamy, and may even help people meet more of their needs through diversifying need fulfillment across multiple partners. Despite this, many existing relationship theories are not inclusive of CNM relationship experiences and aspects of existing theories of positive relationships and sexuality may not extend to people in CNM relationships. Moving forward it is important to consider whether our concepts and measures are inclusive to people in diverse relationships, including those in CNM relationships.

<br><br>A key purpose of theorizing in family science is to develop explanations of family phenomena. There are other purposes for which theory might be constructed (Klein &amp; White, 1996; Schneider, 2006; Swedberg, 2014), but in this chapter, I will discuss theory for the purpose of explanation (Bengtson et&nbsp; al., 2005a; Fine &amp; Fincham, 2013a). Theories are created by theorizing, and theorizing is thus any process by which a researcher develops explanations. While theorizing is about understanding the world, metatheorizing is about understanding theorizing. One may distinguish three different kinds of metatheorizing (Ritzer, 1988): • Metatheorizing to summarize, interpret, and/or critique (the contents of) prior theory. • Metatheorizing to propose rules for effective theorizing. This includes textbooks on theorizing (D.&nbsp;C. Bell, 2009; Chafetz, 1978; Hage, 1972; Swedberg, 2014). • Metatheorizing to describe and evaluate methods of theorizing, largely conducted by philosophers (e.g., Godfrey-Smith, 2003; Hempel, 1965; Popper, 1965; Staley, 2014). This chapter will emphasize the third type of metatheorizing, a discussion which will naturally touch to some extent on metatheorizing of the second type.<br><br>

<br>Author: Smock, Pamela J; Schwartz, Christine R;  
<br>Journal: Journal of Marriage and Family, 
<br>Pages: 9-34
<br>Year: 2022 
<br><br>The authors review demographic trends and research on families in the United States, with a special focus on the past decade. They consider the following several topics: (a) marriage and remarriage, (b) divorce, (c) cohabitation, (d) fertility, (e) same-gender unions, (f) immigrant families, and (g) children’s living arrangements. Throughout, the authors review both overall trends and patterns as well as those by social class and race–ethnicity. The authors discuss major strands of recent research, emphasizing emerging themes and promising directions. They close with a summary of central patterns and trends and conclude that recent trends are not as uniform as they tended to be in earlier decades, making the description of family change increasingly complex.<br><br>

<br><br>Family systems theory holds special significance for the field of family science. In fact, a family systems perspective, or seeing the whole as greater than the sum of the individual parts, is “core” to the discipline’s identity and much of what makes family science “a unique and unified discipline.” Consequently, this chapter describes the origins of general systems and family systems theories, outlines the theory’s core assumptions and key concepts, describes three middle-range theories of note, identifies limitations of the theory, and offers suggestions for growth and expansion of systems theory. In order to demonstrate how a theoretical framework can be challenged by collectivist culture, we use empirical exemplars highlighting Asian American family science in an illustration. This endeavor seems timely given that this chapter is written during the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-Asian racism is on the rise in the United States.<br><br><br><br>
<br>Systems theory emerged in the 1920 s when <a data-href="Ludwig von Bertalanffy" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/people-in-cft/ludwig-von-bertalanffy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a>, an Austrian biologist, proposed a systems approach in the production and implementation of defense systems in order to optimize efficiency, success, and network interactions.
<br>In 1954, von Bertalanffy, along with biomathematician Anatol Rapoport, economist Kenneth Boulding, and physiologist Ralph Gerard founded the Society for General Systems Research.
<br>In the late 1940s, independent from von Bertalanffy, Norbert Weiner, a philosopher and mathematician, tried to unite mechanists, who saw living organisms functioning like machines, and vitalists who saw little connection between laws governing living and nonliving things. Weiner (1948) contributed the principles of homeostasis and self-regulation through feedback. 
<br><br>
<br>Before the 1900s, there were no theories dedicated to analyzing families. 
<br>The concept of the family system was fundamental to Talcott Parsons’ structural functional theory, the most important paradigm in the field of sociology during the 1940s and 1950s. Parson and Bales (1955) identified a four-role family system to include the instrumental leader, the expressive leader, the instrumental follower and the expressive follower.
<br>Structural functional theory was more concerned about conformism in defense of the system to the point of neglecting the system’s equally important need for, and capacity to, change.

<br><br>This article distills insights from historical, sociological, and psychological perspectives on marriage to develop the suffocation model of marriage in America. According to this model, contemporary Americans are asking their marriage to help them fulﬁll different sets of goals than in the past. Whereas they ask their marriage to help them fulﬁll their physiological and safety needs much less than in the past, they ask it to help them fulﬁll their esteem and self-actualization needs much more than in the past. Asking the marriage to help them fulﬁll the latter, higher level needs typically requires sufﬁcient investment of time and psychological resources to ensure that the two spouses develop a deep bond and profound insight into each other’s essential qualities. Although some spouses are investing sufﬁcient resources—and reaping the marital and psychological beneﬁts of doing so—most are not. Indeed, they are, on average, investing less than in the past. As a result, mean levels of marital quality and personal well-being are declining over time. According to the suffocation model, spouses who are struggling with an imbalance between what they are asking from their marriage and what they are investing in it have several promising options for corrective action: intervening to optimize their available resources, increasing their investment of resources in the marriage, and asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating the fulﬁllment of spouses’ higher needs. Discussion explores the implications of the suffocation model for understanding dating and courtship, sociodemographic variation, and marriage beyond American’s borders.<br><br>

<br>Marriage is a means to various ends, a pathway through which people pursue certain goals. 
<br>Historical changes in American marriage since the late 1700 s, the time of the nation's founding, adopting the perspective that America has witnessed three dominant models of marriage. 

<br>The first, which extended from the late 1700 s until around 1850, was a practical model in which marriage was primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their economic, political, and pragmatic goals. 
<br>The second, from around 1850 until around 1965, was a breadwinner-homemaker model (which included romanticized and companionate subperiods) in which marriage was primarily oriented towards helping spouses meet their passion and intimacy needs. 
<br>The third, from around 1865 until today, was (and continues to be) a self-expressive model in which marriage was (and is) primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their autonomy and personal growth needs. 


<br>The primary functions of marriage have ascended Abraham Maslow's (1943, 1954/1970) hierarchy of needs, which, from bottom to top, encompasses physiological needs, safety needs, belonging and love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. 
<br><br>
<br>The Suffocation Model
<br>These tenets build upon three properties of Maslow's theory of human motivation. 

<br>The first property is that needs people seek to fulfill are arranged hierarchically, with lower needs typically possessing greater motivational priority than higher needs. 
<br>The second is that relative to the successful pursuit of higher needs (to achieve mastery, to experience personal growth, etc.) is more likely to require self-insight, and the development of such self-insight frequently requires considerable cognitive and psychological effort over a sustained period. 
<br>The third is that the fulfillment of higher needs yields especially high levels of happiness, serenity, and richness of life. 


<br><br>
<br>One central means through which Americans seek to fulfill their needs is through their marriage, especially as their access to nonspousal significant others has declined. 
<br>Since the nation's founding, the extent to which Americans look to their marriage to help them fulfill their lower needs has decreased, whereas the extent to which they look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs has increased. 
<br>Just as the pursuit of higher needs frequently requires substantial insights into the self, looking to the marriage to help individuals fulfill their higher needs frequently requires that each spouse have substantial insight into the partner, and the development of such insight into the partner, and the development of such insight typically requires considerable communication and responsiveness over a sustained period. 
<br>Even as Americans increasingly look to their marriage to help them fulfill their higher needs, they have, on average, reduced their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage. 
<br>In conjunction, the resource imbalance, resulting from the trends described in Tenets 2, 3, and 4 - insufficient investment to meet the emphasis on higher needs - has undermined spouses' marital quality and personal well-being (although those spouses who manage to invest sufficient resources experience especially strong marital quality and personal well-being). 
<br>Spouses experiencing the adverse effects described in Tenet 5 have three general options for ameliorating or reversing these consequences:

<br>Optimizing their usage of the resources that are available
<br>Increasing their investment of time and psychological resources in their marriage
<br>Asking less of the marriage in terms of facilitating their higher needs. 


<br><br>
<br>The contemporary American model of marriage is the product of a succession of cultural developments that altered marriage's raisons d'etre over time. These raisons d'etre shifted from:

<br>Economics, politics, and pragmatism (late 1700s to 1850)
<br>Passion and affection (1850 to 1965)
<br>Self-expression and personal growth (1965 to the present)


<br>Burgess and Locke (1945) characterized the shift from the first to the second emphasis as a transition from institutional to companionate marriage, and Cherline (2009) characterized the shift from the second to the third emphasis as a transition from companionate to individualistic, or self-expressive, marriage. 
<br>It is important to recognize that, as with biological evolution, cultural evolution is more of a tinkering process than an engineering process. 
<br><br>
<br>Sociologist Ernest Burgess characterized institutional marriages as formal institutions that were strictly regulated by law, social norms, and religion. (<a data-href="Institutional Marriage" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/Institutional Marriage" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Institutional Marriage</a>)

<br>According to Burgess, farm families dominated the marital landscape prior to the last few decades of the nineteenth century. In early America, strong and stable marriages were essential to the welfare of family members and the larger community. Family members relied on one another to meet basic needs, including economic production, child care, education, and elder care. Marriage also created bonds between families that facilitated the sharing of resources. Because cohesive, stable, and interconnected families were necessary for survival, society had an interest in regulating marriage and the behavior of individual spouses. 


<br>In this model, the stability of the family was more important than the needs of the individual family members. Children typically were not allowed to marry without parental permission, and divorce was unacceptable except in the most extreme cases of abuse or abandonment. The raisons d’ˆ etre of marriage were, both directly and indirectly (via broader social processes), related to lower needs in Maslow’s hierarchy. Spouses looked to their marriage to help them fulfill physiological needs such as having enough food to eat, keeping warm in the winter, and having a place to sleep in inclement weather. Spouses also looked to their marriage to help them fulfill safety needs such as being protected from violent attack, having a predictable daily existence, and maintaining a sense of economic security.
<br>In many late-1700 s American communities, market economies were strengthening, which began to enable young Americans to work for wages outside their home and to settle at greater distances from their family of origin. At the same time, the influence of Protestant churches, which had historically exerted substantial control over young adults’ marital choices, was declining. These changes dovetailed with an Enlightenment-era worldview that valued the so-called natural passions, including love and romantic desire. Such economic, geographic, and philosophical developments began to reduce the influence of parental approval in marital decisions, which afforded individuals greater freedom in selecting a spouse, trends that rapidly accelerated staring around 1850. 
<br><br>
<br>Even with the trend toward wage labor outside the home, there was still a need for someone to attend to domestic tasks. For a wife to specialize in domestic production was often efficient, especially given women’s unique biological contributions to childbearing and early childrearing, and having women adopt the homemaking role aligned with prevalent views of women as delicate, virtuous, and sensitive. 

<br>As wives' labor became less central to household economic success, society shifted to sentimental reasons for marriage. 

<br>"As the new rules surrounding marriage relaxed, a new idea gained prominence: rather being based on a code of obligations to society and religion, marriage should be based on ties of affection and companionship between spouses.   "

<br><br>This article addresses the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), family processes, and human development. The topic is framed as part of the general issue of health disparities, which involves the oft-observed positive relationship between SES and the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical well-being of adults and children. A review of recent research and theory identiﬁes three general theoretical approaches that provide possible explanations for the association between SES and individual development: the social causation, social selection, and interactionist perspectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates support for the social causation view that SES affects families and the development of children in terms of both family stress processes (the family stress model) and family investments in children (the family investment model). However, there also is empirical support for the social selection argument that individual characteristics lead to differences in SES. Especially important, recent research is consistent with an interactionist approach, which proposes a dynamic relationship between SES and developmental change over time. Drawing on the combined set of research ﬁndings, the article concludes with the description of an interactionist model that serves as a heuristic for future studies of the links among SES, parenting behaviors, and child development.<br><br>

<br>Title: Romantic Love Conceptualized as an Attachment Process, 
<br>Author: Kazan, Cindy; Shaver, Phillip;  
<br><br>This article explores the possibility that romantic love is an attachment process—a biosocial process by which affectional bonds are formed between adult lovers, just as affectional bonds are formed earlier in life between human infants and their parents. Key components of attachment theory, developed by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and others to explain the development of affectional bonds in infancy, were translated into terms appropriate to adult romantic love. The translation centered on the three major styles of attachment in infancy—secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent—and on the notion that continuity of relationship style is due in part to mental models (Bowlby's "inner working models") of self and social life. These models, and hence a person's attachment style, are seen as determined in part by childhood relationships with parents. Two questionnaire studies indicated that (a) relative prevalence of the three attachment styles is roughly the same in adulthood as in infancy, (b) the three kinds of adults differ predictably in the way they experience romantic love, and (c) attachment style is related in theoretically meaningful ways to mental models of self and social relationships and to relationship experiences with parents. Implications for theories of romantic love are discussed, as are measurement problems and other issues related to future tests of the attachment perspective.<br><br>
<br>Keywords: 
<br><br><br>
<br>Bowlby's major purpose was to describe how infants become emotionally attached to their primary caregivers and emotionally distressed when separated from them, although he also contended that 'attachment behavior [characterizes] human beings from the cradle to the grave.'
<br>The purpose of this article is to explore the possibility that Attachment Theory, designed primarily with infants in mind, offers a valuable perspective on adult romantic love.

<br>For our purpose, which is to create a coherent framework for understanding love, loneliness, and grief at different points in the life cycle. 


<br>Love appears to take multiple forms. 
<br>They have not said how the healthy and unhealthy forms git together in a single conceptual framework. 

<br><a data-href="Attachment Theory" href="https://osuhdfs1-fjkg1gw3g-millielynnashs-projects.vercel.app/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/attachment-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attachment Theory</a> not only provides such a framework, but it also explains how both healthy and unhealthy forms of love originate as reasonable adaptations to specific social circumstances. 


<br>Attachment theory deals with separation and loss and helps explain how loneliness and love are related. 
<br>Attachment theory links adult love with socioemotional processes evident in children and nonhuman primates; it places love within an evolutionary context. 
<br><br>
<br>When a human or primate infant is separated from its mother, the infant goes through a predictable series of emotional reactions. 

<br>The first is protest, which involves crying, active searching, and resistance to others' soothing efforts. 
<br>The second is despair, which is a state of passivity and obvious sadness. 
<br>The third, discussed only with reference to humans, is detachment, an active, seemingly defensive disregard for and avoidance of the mother if she returns. 


<br>The attachment system, as Bowlby called the complex constellation of attachment feelings and behaviors seems have evolved to protect infants from danger by keeping them close to the mother. When very young, a human infant can do little more than cry, make eye context, smile, and snuggle in to encourage its mother to keep it near. Once mobile, however, it can actively pursue its mother and vocalize to her. 

<br>When an infant is healthy, alert, unafraid, and in the presence of its mother, it seems interested in exploring and mastering the environment and in establishing affiliative contact with other family and community members. Researchers call this using the mother as a secure base. 


<br>Attachment theory can be summarized in three propositions:

<br>The first [proposition] is that when an individual is confident that an attachment figure will be available to him whenever he desires it, that person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will an individual who for any reason has no such confidence in the availability of attachment figures, or lack of it, is built up slowly during the years of immaturity - infancy, childhood, and adolescence - and that whatever expectations are developed during those years tend to persist relatively unchanged throughout the rest of life. The third proposition concerns the role of actual experience. It postulates that the varied expectations of the accessibility and responsiveness of attachment figures that individuals develop during the years of immaturity are tolerably accurate reflections of the experiences those individuals have actually had. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 235)


<br>Ainsworth's research suggested a mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her infant's signals and needs during the first year of life are important prerequisites. Mothers who are slow or inconsistent in responding to their infant's cries or who regularly intrude on or interfere with their infant's desired activities (sometimes to force affection on the infant at a particular moment) produce infants who cry more than usual, explore less than usual (even in the mother's presence), mingle attachment behaviors with overt expressions of anger, and seem generally anxious. If, instead, the mother consistently rebuffs or rejects the infant's attempts to establish physical contact, the infant may learn to avoid her. 

<br>Delineated three styles or types of attachment, often called secure, anxious/ambivalent, and avoidant. 

<br>Infants in the anxious/ambivalent category frequently exhibit the behaviors Bowlby called protest, and the avoidant infants frequently exhibit the behaviors he called detachment. 




<br>According to Bowlby, working models (which we will also call mental models) and the behavior patterns influenced by them are central components of personality. 

<br>The claim of cross-situational and cross-age continuity is still controversial but is supported by a growing list of longitudinal studies from infancy through the early elementary school years. 


<br>Continuity, according to Bowlby (1973), is due primarily to the persistence of interrelated mental models of self and social life in the context of a fairly stable family setting:

<br>"Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables:

<br>Whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection
<br>Whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. 


<br>Logically these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming." (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238)


<br><br>
<br>No one has attempted to conceptualized the entire range of romantic love experiences in a way that parallels the typology developed by Ainsworth and her colleagues. Nor has anyone with an interest in romantic relationships pursued Bowlby's idea that continuity in relationship style is a matter of mental models of self and social life. Finally, no one has explored the possibility that the specific characteristics of parent-child relationships identified by Ainsworth et al., as the probable causes of differences in infant attachment styles are also among the determinants of adults' romantic attachment styles. 
<br><br>
<br>We expected roughly 60% of adults to classify themselves as secure and the remainder to split fairly evenly between the two insecure types, with perhaps a few more in the avoidant than in the anxious/ambivalent category. 
<br>In a summary of American studies of three types of infants Campos et al., (1983) concluded that 62% are secure, 23% avoidant, and 15% are anxious/ambivalent.
<br><br>
<br>We predicted that the most important love experience of a secure adult would be characterized by trust, friendship, and positive emotions. 

<br>For avoidant adults, love was expected to be marked by fear of closeness and lack of trust. 
<br>Anxious/ambivalent adults were expected to experience love as a preoccupying, almost painfully exciting struggle to merge with another person. 

<br>This last style is similar to what Hindy and Schwarz (1984) called anxious romantic attachment and Tennov (1979) called limerence.




<br><br>
<br>Respondents' working models of self and relationships were also expected to differ according to attachment style. 

<br>Secure types should believe in enduring love, generally find others trustworthy, and have confidence that the self is likable. 
<br>Avoidant types should be more doubtful of the existence or durability of romantic love and believe that they do not need a love partner in order to be happy. 
<br>Anxious/ambivalent types should fall in love frequently and easily but have difficulty finding true love. 

<br>They should also have more serf-doubts than the other two types because, unlike avoidant respondents, they do not repress or attempt to hide feelings of insecurity.




<br><br>
<br>We expected respondents of the three types to report different attachment histories. According to the theory, 

<br>Secure respondents should remember their mothers as dependably responsive and caring
<br>Avoidant respondents should report that their mothers were generally cold and rejecting
<br>Anxious/ ambivalent respondents should remember a mixture of positive and negative experiences with their mothers. 


<br><br>
<br>Because the attachment needs of insecure respondents are unlikely to be fully met, avoidant

<br>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
<br>
<br>The family's holistic quality represents the unique entity created by the combination of individual members. 
<br>The parts of a system work together to create something new and distinct. (Think of a cake. When the individual ingredients are combined, they create something totally new. Each ingredient plays a unique part in the quality of the cake as they interact). 
<br>In family systems, these new systems-level properties or behaviors emerge as a result of the transactions of the parts and are known as emergent properties rather than purely summative qualities
<br>
<br>Family systems are comprised of interdependent parts.
<br>
<br>When one part of the system changes, all parts will be affected. Reverberations can be felt throughout the system. 
<br>
<br>Family systems are self-reflexive and self-regulating.
<br>
<br>Systems are cybernetic and utilize feedback to maintain themselves and to achieve goals. While early family systems theorists focused on families' inclinations toward homeostasis or change resistance, contemporary theorists also note adaptive changes made possible as a result of family self-regulation. 
<br>Communication in human systems facilitated the family's ability to create meaning, monitor behavior and attain goals, and modify plans and future goal-directed activities based on feedback. 
<br>
<br>Individual and family behavior must be understood in context. 
<br>
<br>Family systems have boundaries that demarcate families from their environments, indicating who is in and out of the family system. A family receives input or 'energy, matter, and information' from its environment returns output to the environment. This interchange of inputs and outputs generates change for both the family and the environment in which it is nested.

<br>Abraham Maslow, a psychologist, developed a 'Hierarchy of Needs' framework to show human potential (1943). 
<br>He argues that a human being cannot achieve 'self-actualization' at the top of the hierarchy without having first met his needs at the lower levels.
