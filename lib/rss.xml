 <br><br><br>The Chernobyl disaster occurred on April 26, 1986, during a late-night safety test on Reactor No.4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine. The accident was precipitated by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK-1000 reactor and operator errors. In particular, the RBMK reactor had an unstable design (a positive void coefficient), meaning a loss of coolant could accelerate the nuclear reaction, and its control rods had graphite tips that initially increased reactivity when inserted (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output could increase if cooling,other safety mechanisms have been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=output%20could%20increase%20if%20cooling,other%20safety%20mechanisms%20have%20been" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). During the test, operators disabled critical safety systems and drove the reactor to a low-power, unstable state. A sudden power surge ensued when they attempted an emergency shutdown, leading to massive energy buildup.<br>Moments later, a steam explosion blew apart the reactor core, followed by a second explosion (likely hydrogen or another steam blast) that demolished the reactor building and exposed the core to the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The blasts ignited fires, including a graphite fire in the reactor core, that burned for ten days. The underlying causes trace to poor safety culture and secrecy in the USSR at the time. An investigation later concluded that the accident was “the result of a flawed reactor design… operated with inadequately trained personnel,” exacerbated by Cold War isolation and lack of safety culture (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The April 1986 disaster at,lack of any safety culture" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20April%201986%20disaster%20at,lack%20of%20any%20safety%20culture" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In short, inherent reactor vulnerabilities and human mistakes combined to trigger the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.<br><br><br>The immediate human toll of Chernobyl was severe. Two plant workers were killed on the night of the explosion – one instantly, and another shortly after from injuries (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the days that followed, dozens of firefighters and first responders who heroically fought the fires received extremely high radiation doses. <a data-href="Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)</a> devastated many of them: 28 emergency workers died from ARS within a few weeks (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In total, roughly 30 people died in the initial aftermath (plant staff and firefighters) as a direct result of the explosions and acute radiation exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive materials in many parts,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=radioactive%20materials%20in%20many%20parts,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Dozens more suffered serious radiation injuries.<br>Soviet authorities evacuated the surrounding population as the scale of the disaster became evident. The nearby company town of Pripyat (population ~49,000) was not informed of the danger on the first day. Only 36 hours after the accident, on April 27, buses finally moved all Pripyat residents out, turning it into a ghost city (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion zone was established 36,8" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=exclusion%20zone%20was%20established%2036,8" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Over the next two weeks, the evacuation zone was expanded to a 30 km radius, ultimately relocating about 116,000 people by mid-May 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In the years following, evacuations and resettlement continued as more contaminated villages were emptied – eventually some 350,000 people in total were relocated due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,result of the accident%2C but" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,result%20of%20the%20accident%2C%20but" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Evacuees left behind homes and belongings forever; many received only moderate radiation doses (most under 50 mSv, though some got higher) during the short delay (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=match at L324 evacuated received,received 100 mSv or more" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=match%20at%20L324%20evacuated%20received,received%20100%20mSv%20or%20more" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The sudden displacement and fear caused significant trauma among the population.<br>Offsite, there were no immediate deaths, but radiation sickness symptoms did appear in some of the local populace soon after (e.g. headaches, metallic taste). Tens of millions across Europe were exposed to low levels of fallout (see environmental impact below), and children in affected areas were given iodine tablets in some regions to block radioactive iodine uptake. The psychological shock and confusion were immense – for Soviet citizens who were kept largely in the dark initially, and for neighboring countries alarmed by the drifting radiation.<br><br>The Chernobyl accident caused an unprecedented release of radioactive material into the environment. The initial explosion and subsequent fire ejected at least 5% of the reactor’s radioactive core into the atmosphere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the Effects of Atomic Radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). A towering plume of radioactive gases and particles drifted with the winds for over a week. The most intense fallout blanketed areas close to the plant. A 4-6 km² pine forest immediately downwind was saturated with radiation; the trees literally died and turned rust-red within days, earning it the name the “Red Forest.” This 600-hectare patch of woodland absorbed lethal doses (up to ~100 Gray), killing the pines and many small animals in the area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Soviet crews later bulldozed and buried about a square mile of this forest to remove the highly contaminated biomass ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=down and buried about a,The Soviet nuclear power authorities" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=down%20and%20buried%20about%20a,The%20Soviet%20nuclear%20power%20authorities" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). In the worst-hit zones, animals also succumbed – for example, horses on an island 6 km away died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by extreme radioiodine exposure (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Livestock had to be slaughtered and crops were ruined across large swathes of land. Water and soil near the site were severely contaminated; radiological “hot spots” (with dangerous levels of cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, etc.) dotted the map in northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.<br>The radioactive plume did not stop at the Soviet borders. Within two days, winds carried radionuclides into Eastern and Northern Europe. On April 28, sensors at the Forsmark nuclear plant in Sweden (over 1,000 km away) detected radiation, forcing an investigation that revealed the source was Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant%2C,rising radiation levels%2C but a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=the%20Forsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%2C,rising%20radiation%20levels%2C%20but%20a" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). As the cloud spread, rain-outs deposited contamination in patches across Europe. Notably, parts of Belarus (to the north) received heavy fallout, as did areas of Scandinavia, Poland, Austria, and the UK. In the United Kingdom, for example, radioactive cesium from Chernobyl fell on upland pastures; in the immediate aftermath, the government restricted the movement of some 4.2 million sheep across 9,700 farms to prevent tainted meat entering the food supply (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Some of these farm restrictions remained in place for decades (the last were lifted in 2012) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) – a testament to the persistent environmental impact. Across Europe, a wide range of foods (milk, leafy vegetables, wild game, mushrooms, etc.) had to be tested or discarded in 1986 due to fallout contamination.<br>In the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, the environment was badly scarred. The reactor fire belched radioactive iodine-131, cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium and other isotopes into the air (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_blank">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). Iodine-131 (with an 8-day half-life) delivered high doses to the thyroids of grazing animals and children who drank local milk in the first weeks, causing later thyroid disorders. Heavier elements fell close to the plant, creating an extremely hazardous zone within ~10 km. The Pripyat River and Dnieper water basin were threatened by runoff; emergency crews dug up topsoil and built dams to prevent contaminants from spreading through waterways. Despite these efforts, ecological damage was acute: plants died, and some animal populations in high-dose areas crashed or stopped reproducing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After the disaster%2C four square,a factor of 20 because" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=After%20the%20disaster%2C%20four%20square,a%20factor%20of%2020%20because" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The immediate environmental legacy of Chernobyl was a poisoned landscape – an estimated 77 kilograms of radioactive material were lofted into the atmosphere, traveling as far as 2,000 km away (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end burning graphite in the,United States%2C India and Kuweit" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=end%20burning%20graphite%20in%20the,United%20States%2C%20India%20and%20Kuweit" target="_blank">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>), and leaving a footprint of contamination that would last for generations.<br><br>The Chernobyl disaster had significant immediate political repercussions, both domestically within the Soviet Union and internationally. In the USSR, the accident exposed the deep flaws in the Soviet government’s crisis management and secrecy. Initially, authorities were slow to admit the severity of the situation. Local evacuations were delayed and the broader public was not informed promptly. Only on April 28 – two days after the explosion, once Swedish monitors raised global alarm – did the Soviet government make a brief 20-second announcement on state TV acknowledging an accident at Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An investigative commission has been" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=20,An%20investigative%20commission%20has%20been" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). This minimalist statement offered few details, reflecting the regime’s instinct to cover up bad news. Such lack of transparency put citizens at risk and angered neighboring countries. Gorbachev himself did not publicly address Chernobyl until May 14, 1986, more than three weeks later. The delay and initial secrecy eroded public trust. Soviet citizens in Ukraine and Belarus, seeing helicopters overhead and troops moving without clear explanation, felt a sense of betrayal that they were not immediately warned of the invisible danger.<br>Internationally, Chernobyl proved to be a public relations disaster for the Soviet Union. The USSR was criticized for its failure to promptly alert the world and for rejecting outside help initially. The incident strained relations with Western Europe – for example, Sweden, Finland, and others demanded explanations as radioactive clouds crossed their territories. The political fallout added pressure on Soviet leadership to be more open and cooperative. The disaster became a catalyst for Glasnost (openness): it demonstrated the deadly cost of government secrecy. Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that “the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl… even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union” five years later (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls The nuclear meltdown at,The commission was to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.gorby.ru/en/presscenter/publication/show_25057/#:~:text=Chernobyls%20The%20nuclear%20meltdown%20at,The%20commission%20was%20to" target="_blank">VIEW: Turning point at Chernobyl — Mikhail S Gorbachev</a>). While historians debate the extent of Chernobyl’s role in the USSR’s dissolution, it undeniably undermined the credibility of Soviet authorities. The tragedy spurred newfound environmental activism and public questioning of nuclear safety in the Eastern Bloc. In summary, the immediate political consequence was a profound shock that forced the Soviet government to confront its own shortcomings, setting in motion changes that transcended the issue of nuclear power.<br><br><br>In the decades since 1986, extensive studies have been conducted on Chernobyl’s health impact. The most clear-cut long-term health effect has been a sharp increase in thyroid cancer cases among those who were children or adolescents in affected areas at the time of the accident. Radioactive iodine-131 released from the reactor accumulated in pastures and was ingested via milk; this led to an epidemic of thyroid disorders. By 2005, over 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported in exposed children/teens (notably in Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Fortunately, thyroid cancer is largely treatable – the vast majority of patients survived. As of 2011, 15 deaths had been attributed to these Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Aggressive screening and treatment campaigns in the 1990s saved many lives. Aside from thyroid issues, major epidemiological surveys have not conclusively linked the Chernobyl accident to a generalized increase in other cancers or health effects in the broader population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), “apart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). In particular, studies have not found a definitive rise in leukemia, solid tumors, or birth defects that can be attributed to Chernobyl radiation exposure in the general population (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of contaminated dairy products and,233" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20contaminated%20dairy%20products%20and,233" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>However, it is important to note that estimating long-term deaths is complex and subject to debate. Low-dose radiation effects are hard to tease out from normal cancer rates. Some scientific models project that over the lifetime of those exposed, Chernobyl’s fallout could cause a few thousand excess cancer deaths (for example, one projection suggested about 4,000 future cancer deaths among the higher-exposed groups in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are expected from other causes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=,are%20expected%20from%20other%20causes" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Other analyses, often using the linear no-threshold model, predict higher numbers – for instance, a 2006 report (TORCH) estimated 30,000 to 60,000 worldwide cancer deaths in the long run due to Chernobyl (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Anti-nuclear organizations have cited figures in the tens of thousands as well (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Anti,146" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). These larger estimates are controversial and not universally accepted; they rely on statistical assumptions and include very low-dose regions where any effect would be too small to measure. The consensus of bodies like the WHO and UNSCEAR is that outside of thyroid cancers, Chernobyl’s long-term health impacts (while tragic on an individual level) have been limited in scope relative to initial fears (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in the most contaminated areas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=radiation,in%20the%20most%20contaminated%20areas" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Nonetheless, each of those statistics reflects personal tragedies and serious illnesses that have affected thousands of families.<br>Beyond physical health, the psychological and social effects have been profound. The disaster uprooted entire communities and created an enduring sense of fear. Studies have found elevated rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse among Chernobyl evacuees and residents of contaminated areas ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=2015%29" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). The term “radiophobia” has been used to describe the chronic fear of radiation exposure that many people carry, sometimes causing more harm (in stress and mental health) than the radiation itself. Being labeled a “Chernobyl victim” or “survivor” led to social stigma and hopelessness in some cases (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Populations in affected areas often reported worse self-assessed health than objective medical exams would indicate, due to perceived danger (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental health from exaggerated radiation,239" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=mental%20health%20from%20exaggerated%20radiation,239" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Thus, a major long-term impact of Chernobyl has been on mental health and community cohesion. The disaster also had inter-generational aspects: while studies (including a 2021 whole-genome study) have not found evidence of significant genetic mutations passed to children of survivors or liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1929 Chernobyl liquidators,generational genetic effects.[ 223" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1929%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,generational%20genetic%20effects.%5B%20223" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>), young people from the region have grown up under the shadow of Chernobyl’s legacy, which influences their social and economic opportunities.<br>In summary, nearly 39 years on, Chernobyl’s health legacy is a mixed picture. There have been thousands of thyroid cancers (largely survivable), and possibly some increase in other cancers and health issues among the most exposed, but no mass epidemic of radiation-induced disease outside those categories that can be unambiguously demonstrated (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The trauma and displacement caused by the disaster, however, left lasting scars on public health in the form of psychological distress and disrupted lives.<br><br>Paradoxically, the long-term ecological effects of Chernobyl include both persistent environmental contamination and the revival of wildlife in the abandoned zone. In the immediate aftermath, Chernobyl created one of the most radioactive environments on the planet, devastating local ecosystems. Yet over time, as humans withdrew from the area, nature has shown a remarkable capacity to rebound in many respects.<br>On the negative side, the environment remains contaminated with long-lived radionuclides that will persist for decades or more. Isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life ~30 years) and strontium-90 (half-life ~29 years) still taint the soil and vegetation in the Exclusion Zone and beyond. In the worst hot spots (e.g. the Red Forest and near the reactor), soil and plant life are loaded with radionuclide levels that inhibit normal biological processes. Studies have found increased mutation rates in many organisms: one analysis showed plant and animal mutation rates in the Chernobyl region were up to 20 times higher than normal background levels (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). There is evidence of elevated mortality and reduced reproductive success in some species living in the most contaminated areas, consistent with radiation-induced genetic damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses of 150–200&nbsp;Sv.,169" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=doses%20of%20150%E2%80%93200%C2%A0Sv.,169" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). For example, some birds in high-radiation zones have been observed to have smaller brain sizes or cataracts, and fewer insects (like bees, butterflies, spiders) are found in these areas in some studies. Trees in certain plots grow more slowly due to radionuclide uptake. Forest ecosystems have been altered: the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) in soil were initially impaired by radiation, leading to a thick layer of semi-decomposed leaf litter that persisted for years. Even today, wild boar in parts of Germany and Austria still show high cesium levels from eating Chernobyl-tainted mushrooms and soils (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported,lamb industry in Norway were" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Agricultural%20Authority%20reported,lamb%20industry%20in%20Norway%20were" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The United Kingdom restricted the,in Scotland were lifted in" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20restricted%20the,in%20Scotland%20were%20lifted%20in" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). And periodic wildfires in the Exclusion Zone can remobilize radionuclides, as burning plants release cesium and strontium back into the air – a concern that persists each fire season. Thus, ecologically, Chernobyl created a chronic environmental hazard in the contaminated regions: a “dirty” ecosystem where radioactive elements circulate and will slowly decay over generations.<br>On the other hand, the absence of human activity in the vast Exclusion Zone has allowed wildlife to flourish in unexpected ways. With 2,600 km² of land (in Ukraine) largely free from people, the area has become an unintended wildlife sanctuary. By the 2010s, biologists conducting long-term censuses observed that many large animal populations were thriving. A 2015 scientific study using animal track counts and camera traps found no evidence of reduced mammal abundance in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone compared to similar uncontaminated nature reserves – in fact, populations of elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves were as high or higher than in less disturbed reserves (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The study concluded that chronic radiation had not significantly affected these wildlife populations; instead, the removal of humans (and associated activities like farming, hunting, logging) allowed nature to rebound vigorously (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Subsequent research and observations have noted an increase in biodiversity: the Exclusion Zone now hosts species rarely seen in the region for decades prior. Wolves roam in large numbers (some estimates suggest the zone has one of the highest densities of wolves in Europe) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Lynx and Eurasian brown bears – species that were once extirpated locally – have been spotted within the zone. Endangered European bison have been reintroduced and are breeding. The Przewalski’s horse, a rare wild equine, was released into the zone in the 1990s and now herds of these horses graze the grasslands of Chernobyl. Moose, foxes, badgers, wild boar, deer, and dozens of bird species inhabit the forests and marshes. Even the Pripyat town itself and derelict buildings are used by wildlife (e.g. nesting birds, small mammals). In essence, in the long term, Chernobyl’s ecosystem has transformed into a unique experiment: a landscape of high radiation pockets but flourishing wildlife, illustrating the resilience of nature when freed from human pressures (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some scientists have termed it a “accidental wildlife reserve.” Photographic evidence and surveys by organizations like the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve (established by Ukraine in 2016) document robust ecosystems, though still affected by the residue of contamination.<br>It’s important to balance this picture: radiation is certainly not “good” for wildlife, and in highly contaminated spots the damage to organisms is real (for instance, smaller creatures with short lifespans show higher mutation impacts). Scientists continue to debate the extent of sublethal effects on Chernobyl’s wildlife – some studies find more genetic abnormalities or shorter lifespans in animals from radioactive hot spots, while others point to the abundant population numbers as a sign of adaptation or tolerance (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora and fauna also suffered,of people since the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=Flora%20and%20fauna%20also%20suffered,of%20people%20since%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). The likely reality is that many species have been able to recover because the benefit of habitat free from humans outweighs the detriments of the radiation levels they experience (which for most of the zone are low to moderate now). The Chernobyl zone has thus become a living laboratory for studying chronic low-dose radiation on ecosystems, with ongoing research that will inform ecology and radiobiology for decades. From an ecological perspective, Chernobyl’s legacy is a landscape of contrasts: lingering contamination and altered biological processes, alongside a teeming revival of wildlife in what has become one of Europe’s largest rewilded areas.<br><br>The Chernobyl disaster’s ramifications extended into the geopolitical and policy realm, influencing nuclear energy policies and international cooperation. In the Soviet Union, as mentioned, Chernobyl was a catalyst for Glasnost and political reform. It forced Soviet leadership to cooperate more with international authorities – for example, in August 1986 (just months after the accident), the USSR sent a delegation to the IAEA in Vienna to openly present details of the accident to the world, a notable break from past secrecy ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were subsequently restarted but all,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=were%20subsequently%20restarted%20but%20all,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ). Gorbachev’s policies of openness were reinforced by the recognition that hiding disasters was untenable. In the bigger picture, Chernobyl “led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union.” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The Chernobyl disaster was a,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20Chernobyl%20disaster%20was%20a,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Some commentators even argue that the disaster contributed to the fall of the USSR by exposing its systemic problems and costing enormous resources – as noted earlier, Gorbachev later said Chernobyl was a more important factor in the Soviet collapse than his own reform efforts (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C particularly between East and,his program of liberal reform" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=cooperation%2C%20particularly%20between%20East%20and,his%20program%20of%20liberal%20reform" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>On the international stage, nuclear safety was fundamentally re-examined. Chernobyl was the first nuclear accident to directly result in radiation fatalities (and remains one of only two Level 7 accidents, along with Fukushima 2011). This spurred a wave of new protocols and cooperation. Western and Soviet-bloc experts began collaborating to prevent another Chernobyl. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was established, linking operators from over 30 countries to share safety information and peer reviews (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since 1989%2C over 1000 nuclear,in the Nuclear Power Industry" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Since%201989%2C%20over%201000%20nuclear,in%20the%20Nuclear%20Power%20Industry" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The IAEA implemented the Convention on Nuclear Safety (adopted in 1994), a treaty that committed nations to international nuclear plant inspections and higher safety standards (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many other international programmes were,June 1994 is another outcome" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Many%20other%20international%20programmes%20were,June%201994%20is%20another%20outcome" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Design changes were rapidly instituted for RBMK reactors – all remaining RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania, etc.) were retrofitted with safety upgrades: e.g. adding neutron absorbers, faster shut-down systems, and eliminating the positive void coefficient at low power (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications have been made to,see Post accident changes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=Modifications%20have%20been%20made%20to,see%20Post%20accident%20changes" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) so that a Chernobyl-type runaway reaction “is now virtually impossible” in those reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). International aid (through organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped finance these safety improvements and the eventual decommissioning of Chernobyl’s other reactors.<br>Public opinion toward nuclear energy also shifted significantly after Chernobyl, especially in Europe. The accident fueled anti-nuclear movements and policy reversals in several countries. For example, in Italy, Chernobyl triggered a national referendum in November 1987 in which over 80% of voters chose to abandon nuclear power; as a result, Italy shut down its existing reactors and scrapped plans for new ones (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C only the widespread popular,a question of individual conscience" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/nuclear-power-no-thanks-aftermath-chernobyl-italy-and-nuclear-power-referendum-1987#:~:text=However%2C%20only%20the%20widespread%20popular,a%20question%20of%20individual%20conscience" target="_blank">Nuclear Power, No Thanks! The Aftermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the Nuclear Power Referendum of 1987 | Environment &amp; Society Portal</a>). In West Germany, large anti-nuclear protests took place, and although Germany did not immediately phase out nuclear (that came later), Chernobyl planted seeds of skepticism that eventually contributed to Germany’s decision to end nuclear power by 2022. Other countries like Austria (which had completed a nuclear plant but never fueled it, due to a referendum) felt vindicated. Even far from Europe, Chernobyl had an impact: nations such as the United States and UK reviewed their emergency preparedness; some countries paused or scaled back nuclear projects. The accident underscored that a nuclear disaster is not confined by borders, leading to improved international radiation monitoring networks and emergency response coordination (for instance, the EU created rapid notification systems for nuclear incidents).<br>Geopolitically, Chernobyl also imposed huge economic costs on the USSR (and later Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) – estimated hundreds of billions of dollars over time – contributing to economic stress. Belarus in particular, which received around 70% of the fallout, spent up to 25% of its national budget on Chernobyl consequences in the late 80s and 90s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In the aftermath of the,Ecology of the Chernobyl Catastrophe" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20the,Ecology%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Catastrophe" target="_blank">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More than 1,borne particles drifted to" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chernobyl-today-0#:~:text=More%20than%201,borne%20particles%20drifted%20to" target="_blank">Chernobyl today | UNESCO</a>). This influenced those republics’ politics and relations; for example, arguments over how to pay for Chernobyl recovery were part of the rising tensions in the dissolving Soviet Union. In Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, Chernobyl left a legacy that shaped its environmental and energy policy – the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl (Unit 3) was only shut down in December 2000 as part of an agreement with Western countries that provided financial aid for safer energy projects ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).<br>In summary, the long-term political and geopolitical impact of Chernobyl was far-reaching. It accelerated the end of the Soviet era, prompted a global reckoning on nuclear safety, fostered East-West scientific cooperation, and strengthened international regulatory frameworks. It also invigorated citizen movements and influenced national policies on energy. The world’s nuclear industry after 1986 underwent significant reforms in training, reactor design, risk communication, and emergency planning, all under the shadow of lessons learned from Chernobyl.<br><br><br>Right after the explosions, an urgent priority was to extinguish the fires and contain the damage at the power plant. In the early hours of April 26, plant workers and local firefighters rushed to the scene with no full knowledge of the radiation hazard. A fire raged on the roof of Unit 3 (adjacent to the destroyed Unit 4) as well as throughout the wreckage of Unit 4. Fire brigades worked feverishly to douse the flames and keep them from spreading to other reactor buildings. By 5:00 AM, most of the external fires (on the roof and around the building) were extinguished, thanks to these responders – many of whom absorbed massive radiation doses in the process (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). However, inside Reactor 4, the graphite core fire was burning like a giant ember, uncontrollably spewing radiation. It continued to burn for ten days, not fully going out until May 6, 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The immediate priority was to,until 10 May 1986%3B it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20immediate%20priority%20was%20to,until%2010%20May%201986%3B%20it" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) when there was no more material left to burn.<br>To combat the reactor fire, the Soviet authorities initiated unprecedented measures. Within 24 hours, the military organized helicopter drops to smother the exposed core. Pilots flew directly over the glowing reactor, dumping load after load of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron into the inferno. In total, more than 5,000 tonnes of these materials were dropped from the air in the weeks after the accident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). It was an incredibly dangerous mission – roughly 600 Soviet helicopter pilots and crew participated, many receiving high radiation doses as they hovered above the destroyed reactor (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The intent was to choke the fire and absorb neutrons to prevent any renewed nuclear chain reaction. (Later analysis suggests much of the dropped material did not stay in the core but the effort likely helped cool and bury the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of helicopters dropping more than,pilots risked dangerous levels of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=of%20helicopters%20dropping%20more%20than,pilots%20risked%20dangerous%20levels%20of" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>).) Firefighters also pumped water into the reactor ruins until fears of a steam explosion in the basement halted that approach. Additionally, teams of engineers drained and vented the plant’s steam suppression pools under the reactor (the “bubbler” pools) to remove water and prevent a potential secondary steam explosion that could have ejected even more radioactivity. This harrowing drain operation required three men to enter radioactive flooded corridors – an oft-cited act of bravery (they survived due to quick work and later medical care).<br><br>Once the immediate crisis of fire and potential further explosions was under control, the focus shifted to cleaning up the massive radioactive mess – a task that would take years. The Soviet Union marshaled an enormous workforce for this, later known as the “liquidators.” These were civil and military personnel conscripted to liquidate (eliminate) the consequences of the accident. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 600,000 people from all over the USSR were officially recognized as Chernobyl liquidators (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_blank">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). They included firefighters, soldiers, engineers, technicians, miners, medical staff, and even volunteers. In 1986–87 alone, about 240,000 recovery workers were on site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_blank">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>). Many were young conscripts in the Soviet Army sent to do manual decontamination work.<br>The liquidators’ tasks were varied and often perilous. In the immediate aftermath, one critical job was to clear the highly radioactive debris from the roof of Unit 3 and the surroundings of Unit 4. Chunks of graphite core and reactor fuel had been hurled onto the rooftops and ground. Radiation on the roof was so intense (up to 10,000 R/hour in some spots) that even 1-2 minutes of exposure could deliver a dangerous dose (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Remote-controlled robots were attempted to shovel debris, but most failed quickly due to the radiation frying their electronics. Thus, human soldiers – dubbed “bio-robots” – had to do it. Working in shifts of only about 40 to 90 seconds each, men sprinted onto the roof, shoveled a few scoops of debris over the edge, and ran back, never to return to that spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1173 Chernobyl liquidators,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1173%20Chernobyl%20liquidators,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl liquidators from the military%2C,cleared from the roof was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Chernobyl%20liquidators%20from%20the%20military%2C,cleared%20from%20the%20roof%20was" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). Each did only one or two trips. By this method, the rooftops were cleared enough to allow construction of the shelter later.<br>Other liquidator crews decontaminated the ground: they used bulldozers and hand tools to scrape up topsoil, which was radioactive, and buried it in trenches. They washed down buildings, roads, and even livestock to remove fallout. A special substance called “Barda” (a sticky resin) was sprayed over large areas by trucks and helicopters to trap radioactive dust and prevent it from re-aerosolizing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters regularly sprayed large areas,2018%2C parked in a field" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=Helicopters%20regularly%20sprayed%20large%20areas,2018%2C%20parked%20in%20a%20field" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). In Pripyat and other evacuated towns, teams went house to house to collect and dispose of irradiated belongings and to euthanize abandoned pets and livestock (to prevent them from spreading contamination). Miners were brought in to tunnel underneath the reactor; they excavated a cavity and poured concrete to create a cooling slab under the smoldering core (“corium”) lava, to prevent it from melting through to groundwater – this prevented a potential groundwater contamination catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of trees were cut down. Contaminated vehicles, helicopters, and equipment were taken out of service – many were buried or dumped in a vehicle graveyard in the Zone (some remain there to this day, rusting and still radioactive (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The official contaminated zones saw,up effort lasting seven" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=The%20official%20contaminated%20zones%20saw,up%20effort%20lasting%20seven" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>)).<br>The liquidators often worked under harsh, hasty conditions with inconsistent protection. Early on, many were not fully informed of the risks. They wore simple cotton jumpsuits or ill-fitting lead aprons and rudimentary respirators, if anything. As time went on, safety measures improved somewhat, but thousands of liquidators exceeded recommended radiation doses (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match at L1258 ,99" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#:~:text=match%20at%20L1258%20,99" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster - Wikipedia</a>). The average dose for the ~600k liquidators is estimated at about 120 mSv (12 rem) per person (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According to the WHO%2C 240%2C000,3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_liquidators#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20240%2C000,3" target="_blank">Chernobyl liquidators - Wikipedia</a>), which is significant (roughly 50 times a typical yearly background dose). Some individuals, particularly those in 1986 roof and core cleanup, received much higher doses (several Sieverts in a few cases). Many liquidators later suffered health issues, and they are honored today for their sacrifice. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus commemorate Liquidators’ Day (often on December 14, the date in 1986 when the reactor was declared sealed) to remember their contributions. These efforts by the liquidators were crucial in reducing the ongoing risk from Chernobyl – they mitigated what could have been a far worse environmental outcome by working to contain and confine the radioactive materials.<br><br>A monumental engineering task in 1986 was to entomb the destroyed Reactor 4 to stop further radiation release. Immediately after the accident, Reactor No.4 was an open wound spewing radioactivity, so the Soviet government undertook the construction of a massive containment structure known colloquially as the “sarcophagus.” Design work began just weeks after the accident, and construction started in June 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Despite the extreme conditions, within 206 days – by late November 1986 – the sarcophagus was completed and put in place over Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June 1986 Completed November 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=30,June%201986%20Completed%20November%201986" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The design of the sarcophagus,The seams of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=The%20design%20of%20the%20sarcophagus,The%20seams%20of" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). (Some sources cite completion in November, others in early December, but essentially seven months after the disaster.)<br>The sarcophagus was essentially a hastily built steel and concrete shield, erected around the ruins to contain the radiation. It was enormous – over 50 meters tall – and had to be assembled largely by machines and remote welders because radiation levels near the core were deadly. Engineers improvised, often working by remote control or from cranes, to bolt together steel panels and pour concrete over the reactor building’s remains. By its completion, the “Object Ukrytie” (Object Shelter, the official name) encased about 200 tons of radioactive corium (lava-like melted core fuel), plus an estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust and debris inside the wreckage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building of the Chernobyl Nuclear,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=building%20of%20the%20Chernobyl%20Nuclear,1" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive contamination  of the,1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=radioactive%20contamination%20%20of%20the,1" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). This ad-hoc containment prevented these materials from directly escaping to the environment. The sarcophagus also incorporated ventilation to prevent heat and gas buildup, and it sealed off the reactor from rain, which would otherwise leach radioactivity into the ground.<br>Structurally, the sarcophagus was supported in part by the ruined walls of Reactor 4 and was not hermetically tight, but it dramatically reduced radiation emissions from the site. By late 1986, radiation levels around the plant had dropped significantly due to the containment and natural decay of short-lived isotopes. This allowed the other reactors at Chernobyl (Units 1, 2, and 3), which had been shut down after the accident, to be restarted over the next year with added safety upgrades. (They continued operating for years under observation; Reactor 2 was closed in 1991 after a turbine hall fire, Reactor 1 in 1996, and Reactor 3 – the last – in 2000 ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit further release of radioactive,Vienna%2C Austria%2C in August 1986" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=limit%20further%20release%20of%20radioactive,Vienna%2C%20Austria%2C%20in%20August%201986" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ) ( <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating the undamaged reactors,53" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html#:~:text=operating%20the%20undamaged%20reactors,53" target="_blank">Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident | NRC.gov</a> ).)<br>The sarcophagus, while a feat given the circumstances, was understood to be a temporary solution with an expected lifespan of perhaps 20–30 years. By the late 1990s, it had deteriorated – the immense radiation and weathering caused cracks and weakened joints. Authorities installed jacks and braces in 1998 to prevent a collapse of the sarcophagus, as it was by then unstable (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C the sarcophagus is largely,is located within a large" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus#:~:text=Structurally%2C%20the%20sarcophagus%20is%20largely,is%20located%20within%20a%20large" target="_blank">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus - Wikipedia</a>). Still, it remained an essential barrier keeping the radioactive inventory of Reactor 4 confined. The success of the initial sarcophagus was that it limited the contamination largely within the 30 km Zone and allowed recovery work to continue around the site with manageable radiation levels.<br><br>Recognizing the sarcophagus was aging, an international plan was developed to provide a more robust, long-term containment. This led to the New Safe Confinement (NSC) – an enormous arch-shaped structure built to enclose the old sarcophagus and reactor building entirely. The NSC was a project funded by a consortium of nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (managed by the EBRD), with design/construction by Novarka (a French-led team). Construction began in 2012. Unlike the original sarcophagus, which was built in place, the NSC was assembled on a clean pad a short distance away and later slid over Reactor 4. By 2016, the colossal assembly was complete, and in November 2016 the entire 36,000-tonne arch was pushed 327 meters on rails to cover the reactor and old sarcophagus (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and preparatory work onsite was,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=and%20preparatory%20work%20onsite%20was,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling equipment were fitted in,based structure ever built" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=handling%20equipment%20were%20fitted%20in,based%20structure%20ever%20built" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

The NSC is designed to last at least 100 years, with a robust steel frame covered by stainless cladding. It is airtight and equipped with cranes and robotic equipment on the inside. The primary purpose of the NSC is not only to keep radioactive dust from escaping, but also to enable the future dismantling of the dangerously unstable old sarcophagus and the removal of the remaining nuclear fuel and debris inside Reactor 4 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The hermetically sealed building will,using as few personnel as" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20hermetically%20sealed%20building%20will,using%20as%20few%20personnel%20as" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).

This will be an extremely challenging task, scheduled to take decades – essentially the final phase of cleaning up Chernobyl.<br>With the NSC in place, the site is far more secure. The new structure prevents water intrusion, controls the environment around the reactor (humidity, etc.), and has filter systems to ensure no radioactive particles leak out during future dismantling work. As of today, the NSC has successfully isolated Reactor 4: radiation levels around the plant have declined further, and the risk of the old sarcophagus collapsing (which could have released dust) is mitigated. In February 2022, during the Russian invasion (discussed later), the NSC’s integrity was maintained despite military occupation of the area. A very recent incident on 14 February 2025 saw a drone strike hit the NSC’s roof, breaching its outer and inner steel panels, but radiation levels remained stable and no radioactive release occurred (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This event underscored the NSC’s importance and resilience.<br>In addition to the NSC, other cleanup infrastructure has been built: for example, a new Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISF-2) was constructed to safely store used nuclear fuel from the remaining Chernobyl reactors, completed in 2020 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent nuclear fuel storage facility,and cold tests took place" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=spent%20nuclear%20fuel%20storage%20facility,and%20cold%20tests%20took%20place" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Waste processing plants and monitoring systems have been established to manage the tons of radioactive waste generated by decommissioning and cleanup. The overall containment strategy is now long-term stewardship: maintain the new shelter, gradually dismantle the old one, remove and dispose of radioactive materials in a safe manner, and ensure the surrounding environment is protected.<br>Through these massive efforts – from the bravery of the 1986 liquidators to the high-tech engineering of the NSC – the Chernobyl site has been transformed from an open reactor wreck to a contained and monitored facility. While full remediation (removal of all radioactive material) will take many more decades if not centuries, the risk of another release has been vastly reduced. Chernobyl has gone from an active crisis to a case of long-term containment, serving as a stark lesson and model in nuclear disaster management.<br><br>Nearly four decades on, Chernobyl today is a very different place than it was in 1986. The reactor is silent and enclosed, nature has reclaimed much of the evacuated zone, and what was once a symbol of nuclear catastrophe has also become a site of scientific study, remembrance, and even tourism. This section covers the current conditions, including radiation levels, the status of the Exclusion Zone, ecological developments, and human activities like tourism and restoration projects, incorporating the latest available updates.<br><br>Ambient radiation levels in the Chernobyl region have dropped significantly since 1986, due to radioactive decay and cleanup efforts. Immediately after the accident, radiation in close proximity to the reactor could be fatal within minutes. Today, aside from a few hot spots, most of the Exclusion Zone has radiation levels that are within safe limits for short-term visits. For perspective, normal natural background radiation is about 2 mSv (millisieverts) per year (which is ~0.0002 mSv/hour). In much of the Exclusion Zone, current dose rates are only a few times above background or even equal to background in some areas (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_blank">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). For example, walking around in Pripyat town for an hour might give a dose on the order of a few microsieverts – negligible in health terms. The ghost city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl plant’s perimeter, and main roads have been sufficiently decontaminated or decayed that short visits are not dangerous with basic precautions. The New Safe Confinement ensures that Reactor 4’s remains emit virtually no radiation into the outside environment; all major radioactive materials are contained within sturdy structures.<br>However, radioactive “hot spots” remain in certain parts of the Exclusion Zone, and these are unsafe for extended exposure or habitation. The most notorious is the Red Forest just west of Reactor 4. Radiation there is still extremely high – on the order of 0.4 mSv per hour (400 µSv/h) in some patches, which is “thousands of times higher than background levels and dangerous to live in” (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_blank">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). A person standing in the Red Forest for an hour could receive as much radiation as they normally would in several months. Needless to say, nobody is allowed to linger there, and it’s off-limits to tourists (even driving through the area, guides take care to roll up windows and not stop). Other localized hot spots include some parts of the reactor complex’s vicinity, areas where radioactive metal equipment lies in the open, or where fallout concentrated in 1986. These spots are well-mapped by authorities; warning signs mark areas of higher radiation.<br>Importantly, the radiation today is not uniform – it’s very heterogeneous. While one spot might be 0.4 mSv/h, a few hundred meters away it might drop to 0.004 mSv/h. Overall, chronic radiation levels have “plummeted” compared to the initial aftermath, and wildlife and even occasional workers can exist in the zone with only low-level exposure outside the hotspots (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether chronic radiation has any,chronically exposed to low levels" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=whether%20chronic%20radiation%20has%20any,chronically%20exposed%20to%20low%20levels" target="_blank">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As time passed and the,lower than typical background radiation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife#:~:text=As%20time%20passed%20and%20the,lower%20than%20typical%20background%20radiation" target="_blank">Chernobyl’s impact on wildlife is still debated by scientists | Knowable Magazine</a>). Long-lived isotopes like cesium-137 have undergone over one half-life since 1986, meaning roughly half of the initial amount has decayed away. Shorter-lived isotopes (iodine-131, xenon-133, etc.) disappeared long ago. The areas that remain dangerous are primarily those with concentrated transuranic elements (like parts of the reactor debris with plutonium) or where cesium and strontium were deposited most densely (e.g. forest floor litter).<br>As of today, experts consider the Exclusion Zone safe for controlled access – scientists, workers, and tourists routinely enter for limited periods. The key is limiting time in higher-dose areas and not ingesting any contaminated materials (no eating berries or mushrooms from the zone, for example, as they concentrate radionuclides). The Ukrainian authorities have an extensive radiation monitoring network on-site. According to reports, even after incidents like forest fires or military occupation (more on that below), radiation levels remained “within normal limits” for the zone and did not pose a danger outside the immediate area (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>A recent real-world “stress test” of Chernobyl’s stability occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl site and occupied the Exclusion Zone for about five weeks. During that time, there were concerns about disturbances to radioactive soil. Indeed, Ukrainian officials reported a spike in gamma radiation readings, likely because Russian military vehicles churned up contaminated dust in the Red Forest with their movements (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl nuclear plant,military machinery through the exclusion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant,military%20machinery%20through%20the%20exclusion" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>).

(There were unconfirmed reports of some Russian soldiers later suffering radiation sickness.) Thankfully, despite the tense situation, no major structural damage occurred at Chernobyl’s containment facilities during the occupation. The plant’s power was cut for a time (raising concern about cooling of spent fuel storage), but backup systems and eventual reconnection prevented any incident (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L174 The Chernobyl,on safety as a result" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20The%20Chernobyl,on%20safety%20as%20a%20result" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match at L195 The SNRIU,first time since 23 February" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L195%20The%20SNRIU,first%20time%20since%2023%20February" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). In late March 2022, Russian troops withdrew, and Ukrainian authorities regained control of the site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022 the Zaporizhzhia&nbsp;plant in southeastern" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,2022%20the%20Zaporizhzhia%C2%A0plant%20in%20southeastern" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). The episode highlighted that Chernobyl, while largely safe and stable, is still a sensitive site that needs protection. It also demonstrated the resilience of the New Safe Confinement and other systems – they withstood the human disruptions without releasing radiation.<br>Another very recent event was the February 2025 drone strike mentioned earlier. A drone (attributed to Russian forces amid the ongoing conflict) detonated on the roof of the NSC. It managed to puncture the outer and inner steel layers of the NSC’s roof in one spot (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). This was a serious incident, but the redundancy of the NSC’s design meant that even with those holes, no radioactive dust escaped. The IAEA confirmed that radiation levels inside and outside the structure stayed normal (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but&nbsp;that radiation levels were stable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy#:~:text=,but%C2%A0that%20radiation%20levels%20were%20stable" target="_blank">Ukraine: Russia-Ukraine War and Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association</a>). Repairs are presumably planned to maintain full integrity. This event underscores that while the radiological condition of Chernobyl is under control, human factors and security remain relevant to its safety.<br>In summary, Chernobyl is not a ticking time bomb now, but a contained contaminated site. Current radiation levels in most areas pose minimal risk for brief exposures, and the worst areas are well-restricted. There is no fission or reaction occurring – the reactor fuel is inert and cooling for decades. The main ongoing safety focus is monitoring and managing the remaining radioactive materials to prevent any environmental release (especially during future fuel removal operations). With the new shelter and strong institutional oversight (even during conflict, international eyes like the IAEA are watching Chernobyl), the site’s condition is stable. It is safe enough for scientists, workers, and even tourists, provided regulations are followed, but it remains unsafe for normal habitation or unrestricted land use in the foreseeable future.<br><br>The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is the officially designated area that surrounds the nuclear plant, from which routine habitation is excluded due to contamination. It was initially a 30 km radius circle, but over time it has been adjusted to cover the regions of highest fallout. Today, the CEZ in Ukraine spans roughly 2,600 km² (1,000 sq miles), an area nearly the size of Luxembourg. It is a mix of forest, marsh, and abandoned villages and towns. To the north, across the border, Belarus maintains its own 2,200 km² Polesie State Radiation-Ecological Reserve – effectively an extension of the Exclusion Zone. Combined, the whole Chernobyl affected zone is about 4,300–4,400 km² of mostly evacuated land. Within the Ukrainian CEZ, the borders are secured by patrols and checkpoints. One cannot simply wander in; access is controlled by the Chernobyl Zone Authority under Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.<br>The zone remains almost completely devoid of permanent residents. In the chaotic months after the disaster, some residents—especially older folks—were heartbroken at the thought of never returning to their homes. Despite official prohibition, a number of evacuees later snuck back into the Exclusion Zone and resettled in their old villages. These people are known as the “samosely” (self-settlers). Over the years, authorities generally tolerated their presence in small numbers. At their peak in the late 80s and early 90s, around 1,200 samosely lived in the zone; today (as of the 2010s), only an aging few dozen to a couple hundred remain, as many have passed away due to old age (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The plant operators' town of,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=The%20plant%20operators%27%20town%20of,Most%20of%20those" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most of those" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=30,Most%20of%20those" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). These residents live mostly in the outer parts of the zone, subsisting off gardens and pensions – they often say they’d rather face radiation in their beloved homes than live in alien cities. They do receive occasional visits from doctors and supplies, but for the most part they live simply and accept whatever risk exists. Their presence is a poignant human facet of the zone, though they are a tiny exception.<br>For everyone else, the Exclusion Zone is a strictly controlled area. The infrastructure of the zone consists of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant industrial site (where a few thousand workers and security personnel commute for monitoring and projects, working in shifts but not living there), and the town of Chernobyl (about 15 km south of the reactor). The town of Chernobyl (not to be confused with the plant itself) actually still functions as an administrative center for the zone – a few hundred staff, scientists, and officers live there on rotations. It has dormitories, an operational canteen, and even two small hotels for visitors. However, this is not a “normal” town – it’s more like a base camp, since everyone there is on limited stay and monitored for radiation dose.<br>The rest of the zone is characterized by abandoned settlements. Pripyat, once a model city of 50,000, remains empty and decaying – an urban time capsule of Soviet life in 1986. Dozens of villages similarly lie in ruins or are being reclaimed by vegetation. Over 200,000 hectares of the zone are wild land with no active human use. There are checkpoints at the 30 km and 10 km boundaries where dosimeters are used to check vehicles for contamination on exit.<br>Economically and administratively, the Exclusion Zone has been put to some new uses in recent years (covered under “Tourism and Development” below, like solar farms and scientific research). But its status is essentially that of a restricted environmental reserve. In 2016 Ukraine designated the Exclusion Zone as a national biosphere radiological reserve, recognizing its unique environment. There has even been discussion by Ukrainian officials of seeking UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Pripyat and Chernobyl’s cultural landscape, to preserve it as a memorial and scientific site. (In 2021, on the 35th anniversary, Ukraine formally started the process to nominate the CEZ as a World Heritage Site (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible Unesco World Heritage Site" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ukraine-proposes-chernobyl-unesco-world-heritage-site-180976567/#:~:text=,possible%20Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site" target="_blank">Ukraine Seeks to Designate Chernobyl as a Unesco World Heritage ...</a>), though the war has interrupted these plans.)<br>The security of the zone came under threat during the 2022 Russian invasion, as noted. For the first time, armed conflict intruded into the CEZ. During the Russian occupation, not only was there concern of accidental damage, but also reports of looting (even theft of radioactive lab samples) and disruption of wildfire management. Post-occupation, Ukraine has to demine parts of the zone due to mines left behind. The episode highlighted that the Exclusion Zone remains important strategically – it was a pathway for Russian forces towards Kyiv. After Russian withdrawal, Ukraine reasserted full control and the zone is back to being off-limits except for authorized personnel. The IAEA now has a permanent monitoring presence at Chernobyl as well.<br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone persists as a largely evacuated territory. It functions as a combination of a radiological reserve, an outdoor laboratory, a memorial landscape, and a buffer around the reactor site. With each passing year, the zone’s identity shifts more towards preservation and research. It stands as a remarkable example of how a large area, once meant for human habitation, has transformed following a technological disaster. Current conditions ensure that the zone will remain set apart for many years to come – a place where time stopped in 1986, now gradually being reclaimed by nature, and cautiously visited by those seeking to understand and remember Chernobyl’s lessons.<br><br>One of the most intriguing aspects of Chernobyl today is its thriving wildlife and transformed ecosystem. As mentioned in the long-term effects section, the removal of humans has allowed many animal populations to rebound dramatically. The Exclusion Zone has effectively become a wildlife sanctuary – arguably one of the most unexpected nature preserves in the world.<br>Surveys and field research in the 2010s documented an abundance of large mammals. Wolves are considered the top predator in Chernobyl’s food chain now, and they range freely. A 2015 census using track counts and helicopter surveys found that Chernobyl’s wolf population was several times higher than in nearby non-contaminated reserves; prey like deer and wild boar were also plentiful (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). The researchers reported “no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance” in the zone, noting that wildlife was doing well in the absence of people (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2015 the published results,a unique sanctuary for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202015%20the%20published%20results,a%20unique%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). This is not to say radiation has no effects, but any potential subtle effects have not prevented populations from growing. Another study published in 2015 in Current Biology concluded the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a “unique sanctuary for wildlife” with greater biodiversity than before the accident, due to human absence (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>).<br>Numerous species have returned to the area. For instance, the Eurasian lynx, absent in the region for decades due to hunting and habitat loss, now prowls the forests again. Brown bears have been observed moving through the zone (these had long been gone from this part of Ukraine). The European bison, an endangered species, was introduced to the Ukrainian zone in the 2010s and has since formed a small herd. Przewalski’s horses – critically endangered wild horses native to Central Asia – were released in the late 1990s as an experiment; they thrived and now about 100 of them roam the grasslands near Pripyat, grazing around abandoned villages. Elk (moose) populations are stable, and wild boar are so numerous that they spill out of the zone into surrounding farmland. Birdlife is rich as well: species like black storks, white-tailed eagles, eagle owls, and others are commonly seen. Even rare species like the globally threatened Greater Spotted Eagle have been recorded nesting in the zone. The wetlands in the Pripyat River floodplain inside the CEZ serve as important habitat for migratory birds. Lakes and ponds hold healthy fish populations (famously, the cooling pond of the plant has giant catfish that tourists love to watch – though their size is due to age and lack of fishing, not “mutations”).<br>Scientists continue to study these animals to see how chronic radiation exposure might be affecting them. Some findings are intriguing: for example, Chernobyl’s birds have been found to adapt by producing more anti-oxidants to counter radiation’s oxidative stress. A study on Chernobyl’s wolves has even tracked them leaving the zone, suggesting the zone might be a source of animals repopulating other areas (raising the question of whether they could carry mutations outward – though no evidence of any harmful spread has been observed). Another recent study (2023) on roundworms in the soil found that even after 1,000 generations in Chernobyl’s radionuclide-laden earth, the worms showed an ability to tolerate the radiation without significant genome damage (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the resurgence of a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://research.uga.edu/news/from-disaster-zone-to-living-laboratory-chernobyl-provides-test-bed-for-uga-researchers/#:~:text=,the%20resurgence%20of%20a" target="_blank">From disaster zone to living laboratory: Chernobyl provides test bed ...</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation,genomes of microscopic worms" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/march/worms-chornobyl-pnas.html#:~:text=Tiny%20Worms%20Tolerate%20Chornobyl%20Radiation,genomes%20of%20microscopic%20worms" target="_blank">Tiny Worms Tolerate Chornobyl Radiation - NYU</a>). This hints at potential resilience or repair mechanisms developed by life in the zone.<br>That said, not every creature is thriving. Invertebrates and small mammals have shown mixed results in studies – some have reduced populations in high radiation sectors. Tree growth can be stunted in those areas. There have been reports of some partial “mutations” or anomalies: for instance, a higher frequency of albino barn swallows, or rodents with cataracts. But overall, the ecosystem functions: trees grow, leaves decompose (albeit slower at first), water bodies have oxygen and life, and a full trophic web (plants → herbivores → carnivores) is in place.<br>The Exclusion Zone’s ecology has also benefited from deliberate protections. Since people aren’t farming or logging, forests have matured and expanded. In Belarus’s Polesie Reserve, there are large tracts of primeval-feeling forest that are home to lynx and wolves. Ukraine’s side set up the Chernobyl Biosphere Reserve to coordinate ecological conservation and research.<br>Interestingly, the zone provides a case study on rewilding – showing how quickly wildlife can reclaim an area when humans leave. Within 5-10 years of the evacuation, animals from surrounding regions started moving in. Now, Chernobyl is cited as evidence that nature can be remarkably resilient. The United Nations Environment Programme noted that the land around Chernobyl has become “a haven for wildlife” in the absence of human activity (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers have found the land,become a haven for wildlife" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20the%20land,become%20a%20haven%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank">How Chernobyl has become an unexpected haven for wildlife - UNEP</a>). Some have even called it Europe’s own Serengeti (though that’s hyperbole; it is a rich temperate forest ecosystem, not a tropical savanna).<br>It’s crucial to remember the wildlife success does not mean radiation is “good” for animals – rather, it underscores how damaging human habitation can be for wildlife, by comparison. Chernobyl removed the anthropogenic pressures (hunting, farming, pollution other than radiation), and wildlife moved in despite the radiation risk. The long-term genetic consequences for these animal populations are still being studied. But as of now, the biosphere of Chernobyl is vibrant. Visitors often report seeing tracks of wolves and boar everywhere, hearing bird songs in empty villages, or even catching sight of a wild horse galloping across the steppe. It’s a striking contrast: a site of human catastrophe has, over time, transformed into an “accidental wilderness.”<br>In summary, the current ecosystem in the Chernobyl area is a mixture of contamination and regeneration. Forests have overtaken former towns; animals roam where people once worked and played. The zone stands as a unique refuge for biodiversity in Eastern Europe, with higher wildlife abundance than before 1986 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence of radiation on mammal,to the absence of humans" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=influence%20of%20radiation%20on%20mammal,to%20the%20absence%20of%20humans" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Ongoing research in this living laboratory will continue to inform us about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation on living organisms and about nature’s capacity for resilience after human departure.<br><br>In recent years, Chernobyl has evolved into a destination for controlled tourism and a site for innovative projects aimed at finding some positive purpose for the Exclusion Zone. Disaster tourism, or “dark tourism,” has grown around Chernobyl, driven by curiosity, education, and the eerie allure of its post-apocalyptic landscape. At the same time, Ukraine has launched efforts to utilize the zone for renewable energy and scientific advancement, turning a place of tragedy into one of renewal.<br>Tourism: In 2011, Ukraine officially opened Chernobyl to tourism, recognizing the public interest and the zone’s educational value (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In 2011 Chernobyl was officially,tourist attraction%2C with many visitors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=In%202011%20Chernobyl%20was%20officially,tourist%20attraction%2C%20with%20many%20visitors" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>). Since then, visiting Chernobyl has been possible via licensed tour operators. Tourists must apply in advance, submit their passport details (since it’s a secure area), and they enter on guided tours usually from Kyiv. These tours stick to relatively safe routes; visitors carry dosimeters and are briefed on safety (like not touching vegetation, not sitting on the ground, etc.). Typical tours include stops at the Chernobyl town (to see memorials and equipment graveyards), the Kopachi village ruins (where only a kindergarten building remains as a reminder), the Pripyat city (where one can carefully walk the deserted streets and see sites like the abandoned amusement park, swimming pool, and overgrown city square), and a distant view of the Reactor 4 complex and NSC from a safe distance. Some tours also visit the giant Duga-1 radar (“Russian Woodpecker”) – a huge abandoned Soviet radar installation in the zone. Tourists pass through radiation control gates when exiting to ensure they haven’t inadvertently picked up contamination (in practice, brief visitors rarely do).<br>Chernobyl tourism remained somewhat niche until the late 2010s when it saw a boom. The success of the 2019 HBO “Chernobyl” miniseries brought a surge of interest – tour agencies reported bookings jumping by 30-40% after the show aired (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One Chernobyl tour agency reported,which has attracted outstanding" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hbo-show-success-drives-chernobyl-tourism-boom-idUSKCN1T51OF/#:~:text=One%20Chernobyl%20tour%20agency%20reported,which%20has%20attracted%20outstanding" target="_blank">HBO show success drives Chernobyl tourism boom - Reuters</a>).

These visitors come from all over the world, drawn by historical interest, a taste for adventure, or even wildlife photography. The Ukrainian government even considered expanding tourist infrastructure given the demand.<br>Tourism has had positive effects: it raises awareness of the disaster’s lessons and provides income (each visitor pays fees that support zone maintenance and local communities outside the zone). Guides emphasize that Chernobyl is a site of remembrance – there are memorials to firefighters and evacuees, and many tours include meeting an actual evacuee or a liquidator who can share their story. Visitors are often struck by the poignancy of places like Pripyat: an empty nursery with children’s toys still there, or murals peeling off school walls – snapshots of 1980s Soviet life frozen in time. This “open-air museum” aspect is why preservationists have pushed for UNESCO status, to protect it from decay and looting.<br>Tourism was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again in 2022 because of the war. As of 2023, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tourist access is suspended for security reasons. But prior to that, Chernobyl had firmly established itself as a tourist destination, and it likely will again when conditions normalize. It’s not a Disneyfied experience – the trips are somber and heavily managed – but it provides a powerful insight into nuclear history and its consequences.<br>Restoration and Development Projects: While the land will be unsafe for farming or regular habitation for a long time, Ukraine has sought creative ways to utilize the Exclusion Zone. One idea has been to turn it into a hub for renewable energy. The reasoning: the zone has abundant land that cannot be used for agriculture, and it has existing high-voltage power lines (from when the plant generated electricity) that connect to the grid. So, why not install solar panels or wind turbines there?<br>In 2018, the first project materialized – a 1 megawatt solar power plant was built within sight of the old reactors (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The new one,first years of its operation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=The%20new%20one,first%20years%20of%20its%20operation" target="_blank">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Installed by a Ukrainian-German company, this solar farm consists of about 3,800 photovoltaic panels on a 1.6 hectare plot, right near the Chernobyl plant. It was connected to the grid and, symbolically, began generating power again at Chernobyl (the first electricity from the site since the last reactor shut down in 2000) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It is the first time,would never produce energy again" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20first%20time,would%20never%20produce%20energy%20again" target="_blank">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). This small solar station powers about 2,000 homes, and plans were floated for expansion. The Ukrainian government has actively promoted the Exclusion Zone as a site for renewable energy projects, pitching that up to 2.5 GW of solar capacity could eventually be installed (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_blank">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). Interest was shown by companies from China, France, and other countries in building solar farms in the late 2010s (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other solar investors could increase,solar park in the area" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Other%20solar%20investors%20could%20increase,solar%20park%20in%20the%20area" target="_blank">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>). The cheap land (effectively free, since it’s unusable for other purposes) and existing transmission lines make it economically attractive – with the caveat that construction workers can only spend limited hours in the area for safety (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two years ago%2C a giant,reactor to be dismantled safely" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2018-10-solar-power-comes-to-chernobyls-nuclear-wasteland#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20giant,reactor%20to%20be%20dismantled%20safely" target="_blank">Solar power comes to Chernobyl’s nuclear wasteland - Bellona.org</a>).<br>Similarly, in 2021 Ukraine announced plans for a large wind farm in the Exclusion Zone. In partnership with a European company, they envision up to 1 GW of wind energy capacity to be developed in the zone (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear option%3A Ukraine plans one,around the Chernobyl nuclear plant" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/nuclear-option-ukraine-plans-one-of-europes-largest-wind-farms-in-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/2-1-1517757#:~:text=Nuclear%20option%3A%20Ukraine%20plans%20one,around%20the%20Chernobyl%20nuclear%20plant" target="_blank">Nuclear option: Ukraine plans one of Europe's largest wind farms in ...</a>). If realized, that would make it one of Europe’s biggest onshore wind farms. Such a project would further transform Chernobyl from a symbol of nuclear disaster into a contributor to clean energy production (without the risks of nuclear). As of the latest updates, these plans are on hold due to the war, but Ukraine has indicated strong interest in resuming them once it’s safe.<br>Besides energy, the zone is used for scientific research and environmental monitoring. Ecologists, biologists, and radiologists from around the world work in the CEZ to study radiation effects on nature, remediation techniques, and even astrophysics (the low light pollution makes it good for certain telescopic observations). There have been projects to test robotic equipment for radiation mapping, to experiment with phytoremediation (using plants to extract radionuclides from soil), and to monitor wildfires via satellites. The zone’s administration also employs people in forestry (they actively manage some forests to reduce fire risk, by removing dry fuel). Some contaminated wood is harvested under careful conditions and used as biomass fuel in special power plants (with filtration) outside the zone – a bit controversial, but an attempt to utilize resources while controlling pollution.<br>One notable “restoration” in a cultural sense is the preservation of certain buildings. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself still has workers doing decommissioning. Tours can visit the control room of Reactor 4 now (in full gear, for a short 5-minute look) – it was opened to very limited visiting in 2019 as part of raising awareness. The control room is, of course, contaminated and everything inside remains as it was after the accident (now with higher radiation levels), so such visits are symbolic. There is also the Chernobyl Museum in Kiev (Kyiv) which is outside the zone but dedicated to its history.<br>One can’t mention restoration without noting that Chernobyl will never be “restored” to its pre-1986 state in the literal sense. The goal is more about containment and adaptation. The current strategy (per international plans) is to keep the reactor area safe and start removing the fuel debris between now and 2065, package the waste, and then possibly begin to dismantle the NSC and other structures after that. Meanwhile, large parts of the Exclusion Zone may be left to nature indefinitely. Some areas with lower contamination could potentially be opened for limited use sooner – for example, a few outer villages were reclassified in the 2010s to allow former residents to visit or even live with some restrictions (particularly in parts of Belarus). But for the most contaminated core zones, the “no man’s land” will persist for many generations – essentially as a wildlife reserve and historical monument.<br>Latest updates (as of early 2025): The war in Ukraine has introduced uncertainties – for instance, the renewable projects are paused, and the zone occasionally faces security issues. But the NSC and other safety systems are functioning. Ukraine’s government remains committed to integrating the zone into its future plans (President Zelensky in 2020 declared Chernobyl a place of “special importance” that should be turned from a negative into a positive symbol). There’s talk of developing better infrastructure for tourists and researchers once it’s feasible.<br>Chernobyl has also become part of global pop culture and education. Documentaries and movies abound. The site draws not only tourists but also journalists, scientists, and even video game designers (the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is set in a fictionalized Chernobyl zone). This human engagement with Chernobyl today is part of its ongoing story – ensuring that the lessons of 1986 are not forgotten and that maybe something constructive can arise from the tragedy.<br><br>In conclusion, the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was a cataclysmic event with causes rooted in design flaws and human error, producing immediate devastation to human life and the environment. Its immediate consequences included loss of life, widespread radioactive contamination, and political upheaval. Over the long term, it has had complex health outcomes (notably thousands of thyroid cancers, but surprisingly limited other health impacts according to UNSCEAR) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20 years after the accident" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=,20%20years%20after%20the%20accident" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), and it left a profound mark on ecology – decimating some aspects of the environment while inadvertently creating a wildlife haven. The disaster also influenced geopolitical currents, hastening the Soviet Union’s end and reshaping global nuclear policy.<br>Cleanup efforts were unprecedented in scale – from the half-million liquidators who risked their health, to the massive engineering feats of containment with the sarcophagus and New Safe Confinement. Today, Chernobyl stands in a state of stable containment: radiation is largely confined, Reactor 4 is entombed under the new arch, and the area is under constant monitoring. The surrounding Exclusion Zone has transformed into a unique sanctuary for biodiversity and a living museum of the anthropocene. Current radiation levels in most of the zone are low enough to allow visits, although the land will not be fully “clear” for normal life for centuries in the most affected parts.<br>Chernobyl’s story is still unfolding – it’s a story of warning about the dangers of nuclear power without proper safety, but also a story of resilience (of people and nature). Efforts continue in making the site useful – whether generating solar electricity or providing invaluable scientific data on radiation’s effects. As of today, Chernobyl is both a monument to a past disaster and a dynamic environment of recovery. It remains a sobering reminder of the costs of human error, and a testament to international cooperation in mitigating a disaster’s aftermath. The legacy of Chernobyl is reflected in safer nuclear industry practices (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge that led to the,virtually impossible%2C according to a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident#:~:text=surge%20that%20led%20to%20the,virtually%20impossible%2C%20according%20to%20a" target="_blank">Chernobyl Accident 1986 - World Nuclear Association</a>), in the lives of survivors and evacuees, and in the lush forests where wolves now howl in a zone once poisoned by fallout.<br>The name “Chernobyl” will forever conjure images of catastrophe, but it also stands for the knowledge gained at great cost and the enduring hope that even the worst environments can find a form of healing over time.<br>Sources:<br>

<br>NAME was present for the Managing Your Mental Health Group today. An introduction to the Managing Your Mental Health group was provided. Intake paperwork was reviewed including the informed consent, confidentiality, mandated reporting, and the group therapy treatment agreement. Assessed symptoms (frequency, intensity, duration). Clients introduced themselves by stating their name, employment/school status, current living situation, a funny fact, something they do well, and something they do for fun. The psychoeducational topic today was mindfulness. Mindfulness was defined as a state of awareness, attention, and intention. Clients were encouraged to pay attention to the present moment without judgment. Mindfulness skills were reviewed including observing, describing, participating, non-judgmentally, one-mindfully, and effectively. Mindfulness exercises were facilitated to allow clients to practice the skills including “Mindfulness of Fruit” and “Mindfulness of Taste." Reinforced appropriate participation and provision of feedback. Normalized the difficulty of practicing mindfulness. Affirmed clients for identifying how the skill of mindfulness could be useful outside of group.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>NAME displayed adequate progress throughout today’s group. They were engaged and participated appropriately. They appeared receptive to today’s mindfulness skill practice. They demonstrated an understanding of the concept and participated spontaneously without prompting.]]></description><link>https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/group-therapy/managing-your-mental-health/curriculum/week-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Clinic Resources/Group Therapy/Managing Your Mental Health/Curriculum/Week 1.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Millie]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:10:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Week 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Check-Ins

<br>Highs, lows, updates, stressors, use of skills?
<br>What do you need from the group?
<br>Process reactions to last week's start of group, check-in around how they are feeling today, any barriers to getting here?


<br>
Review Treatment Plan Goals

<br>Complete Goals of Skills Training - General Handout 1

<br>What are the client’s personal goals of behaviors to decrease?&nbsp;
<br>What are the client’s personal goals of skills to increase?&nbsp;




<br>
Administer the Weekly Progress Check-In Sheet (see sheet below)&nbsp;

<br>
Review last week’s skill of “Mindfulness”&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>Did anyone practice it? Was it helpful? If so, how? If not, what got in the way?&nbsp;


<br>
As we move into today’s group and the introduction of new skills, here is some “food for thought” from Linehan:&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>“This book is dedicated to all the clients of the world who think that no one is thinking of them. I considered telling you that I would practice skills for you, so you don’t have to practice them. But then I realized that if I did, you would not learn how to be skillful yourself. So, instead, I wish you skillful means, and I wish that you find these skills useful.”&nbsp;


<br>
Facilitate Mindfulness Guessing Item Activity:

<br>Start by educating on mindfulness (observing, describing, participating, being non-judgmental, one-mindful, and effective). Explore how these aspects of mindfulness will be integrated into the activity. Put items into a bag. Go around the room, everyone closes their eyes except the describer. The describer describes the item you gave them starting with broad descriptions and moving into more specifics. I usually write on the board types of descriptions in case the person gets stuck such as the shape, purpose, feel, color, weight, size, texture, smell, taste, etc. As the describer begins describing the object, the rest of the group begins guessing what it is, until some gets it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br>
Facilitate Wise Mind Activity:&nbsp;

<br>
Provide psychoeducation regarding what is emotion mind, rational mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;

<br>
Invite clients to draw what it looks like for you to be in rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
Optional Wise Mind Activity: [SKIP]&nbsp;

<br>
Chain of commitments to wise mind: cut slips of paper, write or draw descriptions of wise mind, hand the chains in your room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise:&nbsp;

<br>
Ask group members to identify one thing in their life right now that they know they need to accept. They can take a moment to identify that thing, write it down, and maybe even describe why they belief they need to accept it. Then they rate their level of acceptance on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 being no acceptance and 10 being full acceptance – if they have written it down, they are beyond a 0 which is positive).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
View Linehan introducing “Practicing Radical Acceptance”&nbsp;

<br>
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/OTG7YEWkJFI</a>&nbsp;

<br>
Provide psychoeducation regarding practicing acceptance.&nbsp;

<br>
Introduce worksheets.&nbsp;

<br>
Facilitate Practicing Acceptance Exercise: [SKIP]&nbsp;

<br>
Defining Myself Circle: Draw a large circle on a piece of paper. Ask clients to write or draw words that describe the ideal them inside the circle. Everything they are willing to accept about themselves. Outside of the circle draw what others have said about them that they do not believe to be true, the things they will not accept because it is not them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
Reminder that there are two broad types of skills – practicing acceptance skills (for the things we cannot change) and change skills&nbsp;

<br>
ACCEPTANCE SKILLS: Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance&nbsp;

<br>
CHANGE SKILLS: Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness&nbsp;

<br>
ACCEPTANCE + CHANGE&nbsp;

<br>
WRAP UP, REACTIONS, AND TAKE AWAYS&nbsp;

 <br>
<br>What is your current emotional state? Do Frank Weber's emotions assignment. Color in the amount of each feeling inside you in this moment. Explain why you have that level of the emotion
<br>Emotional Alphabet Activity

<br>Identify as many emotions as possible for each letter of the alphabet.


<br>Role-Play

<br>In groups of two, they are to create a scenario based on an emotion and role-play it for the group. They cannot actually state the emotion, or describe it in detail, but rather show the situation that elicits that emotion. The other group has to guess the emotion being displayed and explain how they saw that emotion (verbals and non-verbals)
<br>Have clients select feeling words or emotion cards and act out that card. Have clients select feeling words and roleplay when they felt this way. 


<br>Collage

<br>Cut out pictures that relate to emotions. Find as many emotions as possible. Label the emotion. 


<br>Feelings Charades

<br>Write different emotions on cards, clients draw a card to select an emotion. She then acts out the emotion without using any words. The other clients guess the emotion based on the client's facial expressions and other non-verbal clues/cues.

 <br><br>
<br>Ho was the last week? Highs? Lows? Accomplishments? Stressors?
<br>Triggers:

<br>What emotional states have you experienced? 
<br>What situations did you encounter that were difficult? 
<br>How did you handle triggers?


<br>Address any significant changes in your life including in your living environment, employment, relationships, etc. 
<br>Is there anything you would like to focus on today in group? Any questions or personal situations you would like to discuss with the group. 
<br><br>
<br>It helps to talk about the things your group members are doing well first. Start with the positive before providing more challenging feedback. 
<br>Empathy statements are helpful. Put yourself in the other person's shoes. 
<br>Self-relating statements are also beneficial. Explain how you have had similar thoughts, feelings, or experiences. 
<br>Some suggestions for how to start feedback include:

<br>"I really thought you did a good job talking about..."
<br>"What was it like to share that with the group?"
<br>"What do you think about..."
<br>"I would have liked to have seen..."

 <br>
<br>This activity is to help identify the similarities and differences we may have. 
<br>We want to honor and acknowledge those differences but also brings to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. 
<br>This process might prove difficult or awkward. 
<br>This is about getting to know each other and breaking down stereotypes. 
<br>You can choose if and how you participate. 
<br>This acticity is simple. Each one of us will read a statement. If the statement is something you have experienced, you cross the line. 
<br>We will then reset and read the next statement. This exercise has to be done in complete silence.
<br>The purpose of this exercise is to help students become more aware of the many types of diversity that exist and to find students who share the same experiences.  For this exercise, students form a line across the classroom.  Students are asked to step forward and then back into the line based on questions asked by the instructor.  Start with questions that are non-threatening to get students comfortable with the exercise.  Students can choose to “pass” if they want.  Vary the questions to suit your group of students.
<br><br>
<br>Listening:

<br>Let’s have silence throughout the exercise – no talking, snickering, giggling, etc. Silence will allow all of us to participate fully. Silence will also enable us to experience our personal thoughts and feelings more deeply.


<br>Respect:

<br>It is imperative that we respect the dignity of each person who is here. Everything that is shared should remain confidential. Nothing that is offered should leave this room.


<br>Each statement will require you to make the decision crossing the line or not crossing the line. There are no right or wrong answers. NO PRESSURE. No one here is under any pressure to respond in any particular way to any of the questions. If you have any doubts about sharing some part of yourself, you should feel perfectly comfortable with your decision not to step forward.
<br>What kind of feelings did you have as you participated?
<br>How did you feel when there were fewer of you on one side of the room?
<br>How did the movement of others influence you?
<br>What did you learn through this activity that can make our group more welcoming. 
<br>Walk across the line if your favorite color is blue.  Look into the eyes of those you brought with you.  Look at those you left behind.  Allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling.  Walk back across the line.
<br>Questions:

<br>You prefer the city. 
<br>You have visited another country. 
<br>You have never flown. 
<br>You know very little about your cultural heritage. 
<br>You are the oldest in your family. 
<br>You have lost someone you loved. 
<br>You are from Ohio. 
<br>You enjoy sports. 
<br>You are an only child. 
<br>You got picked on in school. 
<br>Your parents divorced. 
<br>You consider yourself a religious person. 
<br>You prefer Coke to Pepsi.
<br>You prefer vanilla to chocolate.
<br>You have been in love
<br>You have had surgery. 
<br>You have lived in another state. 
<br>You know someone who has been sexually assaulted. 
<br>You have felt alone, unwelcomed, afraid. 
<br>You knew someone who has attempted to die by suicide. 
<br>You have cried at least once this year for someone or something other than yourself. 
<br>You or someone you know is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. 
<br>You have been a bystander to a racial, sexual, or cultural joke. 
<br>You have read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. 
<br>You did not cross the line in a previous statement when you should have. 
<br>You are willing to understand, support, and celebrate diversity. 
<br>If you have not crossed the line during this activity, cross it now. 


<br>Here are some additional questions:

<br>Walk across the line if you have ever experienced a bad hair day.
<br>Walk across the line if you are undecided about your major. 
<br>Walk across the line if your parents are divorced. 
<br>Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is in a gang. 
<br>Walk across the line if you or someone you care about lives in poverty. 
<br>Walk across the line if you or someone you care about has been homeless. 
<br>Walk across the line if you have been told or think you are fat. 
<br>Walk across the line if someone you care about has been abused physically, psychologically, or sexually. 
<br>Walk across the line if you or someone you care about is dependent on alcohol or drugs.
<br>Walk across the line if you know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 
<br>Walk across the line if you know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDS. 
<br>Walk across the line if you have been put down by someone else and it hurt you. 
<br>Walk across the line if you put someone down and you knew it hurt them. 


<br>At the conclusion of this exercise, ask students what they learned from it.  The usual comment is that students are not aware that so many share the same experiences.

 <br>
<br>Start with a bowl of apples (or any fruit). Pass the bowl around and have each person take one item. Mindfully observe the piece of fruit for a few minutes. When the bell rings everyone puts the fruit back into the bowl and then see if each person can "recognize" their original fruit.
<br>Instructions:

<br>First take your piece of fruit and weigh it up in your hands. Get a sense of the texture of the skin, the temperature, the weight, how it feels in the palm of your hand, how it feels as you run your fingertips across its surface. What do you notice here? Spend a few moments doing this.
<br>Next, we are going to use our sense of smell to breathe in the scent of the fruit. What do you notice here? Try to stay with just sensing the fruit, perhaps notice if your mind begins to make associations.
<br>Your mind will likely wander or begin thinking about things as you move through this exercise, so just notice make a note of these thoughts, and come back to paying full attention using your five senses.
<br>Next, take a good look at the fruit. Noticing its visual qualities - color, shape, any irregularities, the stalk, surface texture. Just take it in - looking for details. Keep an eye out for any tendency to make comparisons or judge the fruit! You'd be surprised how often our mind rushes to judgements.
<br>You could try next bringing the fruit up to your ear and listening to the sound it makes when you squeeze it or tap it. What sound does a fruit make? (I'll bet you never wondered that before!)
<br>Next, take a few moments to feel your fruit. Noticing how it feels. Is it smooth? Is it rough?
<br>Bring the practice to a close when you are ready.
<br>When you are finished, it's good to reflect on the exercise... what did you notice? Was anything surprising? Where did your mind go? What do you miss when you are on autopilot? How might the skill of mindfulness and observing be helpful to you in your daily life? Under what circumstances might you use this skill?

<br>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)&nbsp;is often a long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions), and behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.
<br><br>



<br><br>
<br>Of adults with OCD in the past year, degree of impairment ranged from mild to severe, as shown in Figure 2. Impairment was determined by scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale.

 <br><br>
<br>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&nbsp;can develop after exposure to a potentially traumatic event that is beyond a typical stressor. Events that may lead to PTSD include, but are not limited to, violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, combat, and other forms of violence. Exposure to events like these is common. About one half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but most do not develop PTSD. People who experience PTSD may have persistent, frightening thoughts and memories of the event(s), experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or may be easily startled. In severe forms, PTSD can significantly impair a person's ability to function at work, at home, and socially.

 <br><br>
<br>Anorexia nervosa&nbsp;is characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health; a relentless pursuit of thinness; a distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight; and extremely disturbed eating behavior. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely malnourished.
<br><br>
<br>The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in adults was 0.6%.
<br>Lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa was three times higher among females (0.9%) than males (0.3%).
<br>A past year prevalence estimate for anorexia nervosa was not generated in the NCS-R sample of respondents.

 <br><br>
<br>Binge eating disorder&nbsp;is characterized by recurrent binge eating episodes during which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating. Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge eating episodes are not followed by purging, excessive exercise or fasting. As a result, people with binge eating disorder often are overweight or obese.

 <br><br>
<br>Bulimia nervosa&nbsp;is characterized by binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short time, along with the sense of a loss of control) followed by a type of behavior that compensates for the binge, such as purging (e.g., vomiting, excessive use of laxatives, or diuretics), fasting, and/or excessive exercise. Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. But like people with anorexia, they often fear gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape.

 <br>
<br>Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person’s eating behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia nervosa.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), median age of onset was 21 years-old for binge eating disorder and 18 years-old for both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.
<br><br>
<br>Based on diagnostic interview data from the NCS-R, the data below indicate the past year prevalence of each type of eating disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 and older.<br>

 <br><br>
<br>Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g. verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g. physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. 
<br>The tempter outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. 
<br>The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. 
<br>The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
<br>The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). 
<br>Criteria 1-5 have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all the symptoms in Criteria 1-5. 
<br>Criteria 1 and 4 are present in at least two of three setting (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these. 
<br>The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. 
<br>By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria 1-6 is before 10 years. 
<br>There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. 

<br>Developmentally appropriate mood elevation should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. 


<br>The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorders and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., <a data-href="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder-(asd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, <a data-href="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-(ptsd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</a>, <a data-href="Separation Anxiety Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation Anxiety Disorder</a>, <a data-href="Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/persistent-depressive-disorder-(dysthymic-disorder).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)</a>)

Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 
<br>If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. 


<br>The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition. 
<br><br>
<br>Chronic, severe, persistent irritability. 

<br>This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations:

<br>Temper outbursts:

<br>These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others).
<br>They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion 3) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria 5 and 6). 


<br>Chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. 

<br>This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion 4)






<br><br>
<br>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. 
<br>Consistent gender difference in prevalence have not been reported in population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance. 
<br>The diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups.
<br><br>
<br>Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (6-18 years).
<br>Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. A relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of: 

<br><a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>
<br><a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>
<br><a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a>


<br><br>
<br>Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 
<br><br>
<br>A family history may be a risk factor. 
<br>Those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. 

<br>For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 

<br>The same behavior deficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. 




<br><br>
<br>Socioeconomic factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as post-conflict zones or communities affected by long-standing racism and discrimination. 
<br>It is important to distinguish disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and transitory. 
<br><br>
<br>While irritability has a strong genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role. 
<br><br>
<br>Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. 
<br>In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common. 
<br><br>
<br>Differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> and <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> requires particularly careful assessment. 
<br><br>
<br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and <a data-href="Bipolar Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/bipolar-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipolar Disorder</a> s in children involved longitudinal course of the core symptoms. 
<br>In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. 

<br>The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child. During a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baselines. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. 
<br>The irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 


<br>The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. 
<br>Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 
<br><br>
<br>The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. 
<br>The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder required severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. 
<br>In only approximately 15% of individuals with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. 

<br>Even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. 


<br>There is a more prominent mood component among individuals with mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. 
<br>It should also be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood patterns. 
<br><br>
<br>Children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. 

<br>Children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 


<br><br>
<br>Unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual's mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. 
<br>A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice-weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 
<br>These two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. 
<br><br>
<br>Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. 
<br>The strongest overlap is with <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a>. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. 

<br>These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. 


<br>If children have symptoms that meet criteria for <a data-href="Oppositional Defiant Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Intermittent Explosive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intermittent Explosive Disorder</a> and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. 
<br>The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.

 <br><br>
<br>Depression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.
<br>To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.
<br>There are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances.
<br><br><br>
<br>Includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities.
<br><br>
<br>(Also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder)
<br>Consists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years. 
<br><br>
<br>Depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression. 
<br><br>
<br>Depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer.
<br><br>
<br>A severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see).
<br><br>
<br>Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributed to another medical condition)

<br>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others 9 e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
<br>Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)
<br>Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
<br>Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
<br>Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
<br>Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 
<br>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
<br>Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)
<br>Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. 


<br>The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 
<br>The episode is not attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. 

<br>Note: Criteria 1-3 represents a major depressive episode. 
<br>Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., <a data-href="Bereavement" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Bereavement" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bereavement</a>, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion 1, which may resemble a depressive episode. 


<br>There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. 

<br>This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. 


<br><br><br>
<br>For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. 
<br>If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity.
<br>In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: Major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. 

<br>Specify if:

<br>With anxious distress (pg. 210-211)
<br>With mixed features (pg. 211)
<br>With melancholic features (pg. 211-212)
<br>With atypical features (pg. 212)
<br>With mood-congruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
<br>With mood-incongruent psychotic features (pg. 213)
<br>With catatonia (pg. 213) [Coding Note: Use additional code F06.1]
<br>With peripartum onset (pg. 213)
<br>With seasonal pattern (applies to pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes) (pg. 214)




<br><br>
<br>Major depressive disorder is defined by the presence of at least one major depressive episode occurring in the absence of a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. 

<br>The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day, nearly every day (Criterion 1). 


<br>The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes: 

<br>Changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity
<br>Decreased energy
<br>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
<br>Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
<br>Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. 


<br>To count toward a diagnosis of a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared with the individual's pre-episode status. 

<br>The symptoms must occur nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation, which must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs to occur once. 
<br>The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

<br>For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly increased effort. The presenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest. 
<br>The failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis. 




<br>Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near delusional guilt.
<br>The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps' (Criterion 1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview. 
<br>Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). 

<br>In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. 


<br>Diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present. 

<br>Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, 'not caring anymore,' or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion 1.2)
<br>Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations. 
<br>In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. 


<br>Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. 

<br>When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion 1.3).


<br>Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion 1.3). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too ealry and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. 

<br>Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. 


<br>Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume)

 <br>
<br>Perinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. In rare cases, the symptoms are severe enough that the health of the mother and baby may be at risk. Perinatal depression can be treated. This brochure describes the signs and symptoms of perinatal depression and how you or a loved one can get help.
<br><br><br>
<br>Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The word “perinatal” refers to the time before and after the birth of a child. Perinatal depression includes depression that begins during pregnancy (called prenatal depression) and depression that begins after the baby is born (called postpartum depression). Mothers with perinatal depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that may make it difficult for them to carry out daily tasks, including caring for themselves or others.
<br><br>
<br>The “baby blues” is a term used to describe mild mood changes and feelings of worry, unhappiness, and exhaustion that many women sometimes experience in the first 2 weeks after having a baby. Babies require around-the-clock care, so it’s normal for mothers to feel tired or overwhelmed sometimes. If mood changes and feelings of anxiety or unhappiness are severe, or if they last longer than 2 weeks, a woman may have postpartum depression. Women with postpartum depression generally will not feel better unless they receive treatment.
<br><br>
<br>Perinatal depression is a real medical illness and can affect any mother—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Women are not to blame or at fault for having perinatal depression: it is not brought on by anything a mother has or has not done. Perinatal depression does not have a single cause. Research suggests that perinatal depression is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Life stress (for example, demands at work or experiences of past trauma), the physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby, and changes in hormones that occur during and after pregnancy can contribute to the development of perinatal depression. In addition, women are at greater risk for developing perinatal depression if they have a personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder or if they have experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy.
<br><br>
<br>Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mental illness that occurs after childbirth. PP is a medical emergency, and it is important to seek help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Women who have PP can have delusions (thoughts or beliefs that are not true), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling things that are not there), mania (a high, elated mood that often seems out of touch with reality), paranoia, and confusion. Women who have PP also may be at risk for harming themselves or their child and should receive help as soon as possible. Recovery is possible with professional help.
<br><br>
<br>Some women may experience a few symptoms of perinatal depression; others may experience several symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of perinatal depression include:

<br>Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
<br>Irritability
<br>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness
<br>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
<br>Fatigue or abnormal decrease in energy
<br>Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
<br>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
<br>Difficulty sleeping (even when the baby is sleeping), awakening early in the morning, or oversleeping
<br>Abnormal appetite, weight changes, or both
<br>Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause or do not ease even with treatment
<br>Trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with the new baby
<br>Persistent doubts about the ability to care for the new baby
<br>Thoughts about death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby


<br><br>
<br>Treatment for perinatal depression is important for the health of both the mother and the baby, as perinatal depression can have serious health effects on both. With proper treatment, most women feel better and their symptoms improve.
<br>Treatment for perinatal depression often includes therapy, medications, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may be an option to explore.
<br><br>
<br>Several types of psychotherapy can help women with perinatal depression. Two examples of evidence-based approaches that have been used to treat perinatal depression include <a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> and interpersonal therapy.
<br><br>
<br>CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help people with depression and anxiety. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations. People learn to challenge and change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior as a way of improving their depressive and anxious feelings and emotions. CBT can be conducted individually or with a group of people who have similar concerns.
<br><br>
<br>IPT is an evidence-based therapy that has been used to treat depression, including perinatal depression. It is based on the idea that interpersonal and life events impact mood and vice versa. The goal of IPT is to help people to improve their communication skills within relationships, to develop social support networks, and to develop realistic expectations that allow them to deal with crises or other issues that may be contributing to their depression.
<br><br>
<br>Women with perinatal depression are most commonly treated with antidepressants, which are medications used to treat depression. They may help improve the way the brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should notify their health care provider before starting antidepressants so their&nbsp;health care provider can work to minimize the baby’s exposure to the medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take antidepressants during pregnancy is very low; however, women should work with their&nbsp;health care provider to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and to find the best solution for their situation. Women may need to try several different medications before finding the one that improves their symptoms and has manageable side effects.
<br>Antidepressants take time—usually 6 to 8 weeks—to work, and symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give medication a chance before deciding whether or not it works.
<br>Do not stop taking antidepressants without the help of a health care provider. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. Stopping medications abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. When a woman and her health care provider have decided it is time to stop the medication, the health care provider will help her to decrease the dose slowly and safely.
<br>After the birth of a child, many women experience a drop in certain hormones, which can lead to feelings of depression. FDA has approved one medication, called brexanolone, specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. Administered in a hospital, this drug works to relieve depression by restoring the levels of these hormones.
<br><br>
<br>It is important to understand that depression is a medical condition that impacts the mother, the child, and the family. Spouses, partners, family members, and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of perinatal depression in a new mother. Treatment is central to recovery. Family members can encourage the mother to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.
<br>Support or advocacy groups can offer a good source of support and information. One example of this type of group is&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.postpartum.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.postpartum.net/" target="_blank">Postpartum Support International</a>

 <br><br>
<br>Persistent depressive disorder (formerly dysthymic disorder)&nbsp;is characterized by chronic low-level depression that is not as severe, but may be longer lasting than, major depressive disorder. A diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder requires having experienced a combination of depressive symptoms for two years or more.

 <br><br>




<br><br>
<br>SAD is a type of depression characterized by a recurrent seasonal pattern, with symptoms lasting about 4−5 months out of the year. The signs and symptoms of SAD include those associated with depression as well as disorder-specific symptoms that differ for winter-pattern versus summer-pattern SAD.
<br>Symptoms of depression can include:

<br>Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks
<br>Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
<br>Feelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness
<br>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
<br>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
<br>Decreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down
<br>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
<br>Changes in sleep or appetite or unplanned weight changes
<br>Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment
<br>Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts


<br>For winter-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include:

<br>Oversleeping (hypersomnia)
<br>Overeating, particularly with a craving for carbohydrates, leading to weight gain
<br>Social withdrawal (feeling like “hibernating”)


<br>For summer-pattern SAD, additional symptoms can include:

<br>Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
<br>Poor appetite, leading to weight loss
<br>Restlessness and agitation
<br>Anxiety
<br>Violent or aggressive behavior


<br>Winter-pattern SAD should not be confused with “holiday blues”—feelings of sadness or anxiety brought on by stresses at certain times of the year. The depression associated with SAD is related to changes in daylight hours, not the calendar, so stresses associated with the holidays or predictable seasonal changes in work or school schedules, family visits, and so forth are not the same as SAD.
<br><br>
<br>To be diagnosed with SAD, a person must meet the following criteria:

<br>They have the symptoms of depression or the more specific symptoms of winter- or summer-pattern SAD listed above.
<br>Their depressive episodes occur during specific seasons (winter or summer) for at least 2 consecutive years. However, not all people with SAD experience symptoms every year.
<br>Their depressive episodes during the specific season are more frequent than depressive episodes experienced at other times of the year.


<br><br>
<br>It is estimated that millions of Americans experience SAD, although many may not know they have this common disorder. In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.
<br>SAD occurs much more often in women than in men. Winter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-pattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people living farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in the winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England are more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida.
<br>SAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves repeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes (less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I disorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other mental disorders, such as <a data-href="Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-(adhd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a data-href="Eating Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/eating-disorders/eating-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eating Disorders</a>, <a data-href="Anxiety Disorders" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-disorders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anxiety Disorders</a>, or <a data-href="Panic Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/panic-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Panic Disorder</a>. 
<br>SAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common in people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, such as <a data-href="Major Depressive Disorder" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders/major-depressive-disorder.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Major Depressive Disorder</a> or <a data-href="Schizophrenia" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Schizophrenia</a>. 
<br><br>
<br>Researchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most research to date has investigated potential causes of winter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier to study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern SAD, and more research is needed.
<br>Studies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-pattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also suggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help maintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may prevent these molecules from functioning properly, contributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.
<br>Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in people with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is believed to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin D consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the winter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, further reducing serotonin activity.
<br>Other studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to altered levels of melatonin—a hormone important for maintaining the normal sleep−wake cycle. People with winter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can increase sleepiness and lead to oversleeping.
<br>In contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have reduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days worsening sleep quality and leading to depression symptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high temperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, these theories have not been systematically tested.
<br>Both serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body’s daily rhythm tied to the seasonal night−day cycle. In people with SAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal daily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to seasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and behavior changes.
<br>Negative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer and its associated limitations and stresses are also common among people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, however, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the mood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment.
<br><br>
<br>Treatments are available to help people with SAD. They fall into four main categories that can be used alone or in combination:

<br>Light therapy
<br>Psychotherapy
<br>Antidepressant medication
<br>Vitamin D


<br>Light therapy and vitamin D are treatments for winter-pattern SAD, whereas psychotherapy and antidepressants are used to treat depression in general, including winter- and summer-pattern SAD. There are no treatments specific to summer-pattern SAD.
<br><br>
<br>Since the 1980s, light therapy has been a mainstay for treating winter-pattern SAD. It aims to expose people with SAD to a bright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in darker months.
<br>For this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright light box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30−45 minutes, usually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light box, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor light, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making this a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain eye diseases or people taking certain medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative treatments or use light therapy under medical supervision.
<br><br>
<br>Psychotherapy can help people with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that contribute to depression.
<br><a data-href="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-(cbt).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a type of psychotherapy aimed at helping people learn to challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive and anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with SAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in two weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing negative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts about the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with more positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called behavioral activation, which helps people identify and schedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to offset the loss of interest they typically experience in the winter or summer.
<br>When researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light therapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving SAD symptoms—although some symptoms got better slightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a long-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters found that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer.
<br><br>
<br>Medications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can be effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with talk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress.&nbsp;
<br>Antidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work. Problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may need to try several medications to find the one that works best.
<br>Because SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with disturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly enhance a person’s mood.
<br>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release form designed to last longer in the body. For many people, bupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive episodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring.
<br><br>
<br>Because many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. However, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD have produced mixed results, with some studies indicating that it is as effective as light therapy and other studies finding no effect.
<br><br>
<br>Because the onset of SAD is so predictable, people with a history of the disorder might benefit from starting the treatments mentioned above before the fall (for winter-pattern SAD) or spring (for summer-pattern SAD) to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms. To date, few studies have investigated whether SAD can be prevented.

 <br><br>
<br>Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts in mood and energy levels are more severe than the normal ups and downs that are experienced by everyone.
<br><br>
<br>Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older.

<br>An estimated 2.8% of U.S. adults had bipolar disorder in the past year.
<br>Past year prevalence of bipolar disorder among adults was similar for males (2.9%) and females (2.8%).


<br>An estimated 4.4% of U.S. adults experience bipolar disorder at some time in their lives.
<br>Figure 1: <img alt="Bipolar Disorder.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/bipolar-disorder.png">
<br><br>
<br>Of adults with bipolar disorder in the past year, degree of impairment ranged from moderate to serious, as shown in Figure 2. Impairment was determined by scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale.

<br>An estimated 82.9% of people with bipolar disorder had serious impairment, the highest percent serious impairment among mood disorders.
<br>An estimated 17.1% had moderate impairment.


<br>Figure 2: <img alt="Bipolar Disorder-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/bipolar-disorder-1.png">
<br><br>
<br>Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), Figure 3 shows lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder among U.S. adolescents aged 13-18.

<br>An estimated 2.9% of adolescents had bipolar disorder, and 2.6% had severe impairment. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria were used to determine impairment.
<br>The prevalence of bipolar disorder among adolescents was higher for females (3.3%) than for males (2.6%).

 <br>
<br>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&nbsp;is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through adolescence and into adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity (over-activity).
<br><br>


<br><br>
<br>Based on data from the NSCH, the median age for onset for children with current ADHD was 6 years. 
<br>More severe cases of ADHD in children, as described by parents, were diagnosed earlier.

<br>The median age of diagnosis for severe ADHD was 4 years. 
<br>The median age of diagnosis for moderate ADHD was 6 years.
<br>The median age of diagnosis for mild ADHD was 7 years.


<br>Approximately one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood.
<br><br>
<br>Medication can be used to effectively treat ADHD symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity, and is the single most effective treatment for reducing ADHD symptoms.
<br>Figure 2 is based on data from the NSCH and shows medication use among children with ADHD in 2011. An estimated 69.3% of children with a current diagnosis of ADHD received medication for ADHD.
<br>Medication use increased 4% overall from 2007 to 2011, particularly among male teens.

<br>Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey–Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), Figure 3 shows the lifetime prevalence of ADHD among U.S. adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.

<br>The lifetime prevalence of ADHD was 8.7%.
<br>Nearly half of all cases showed severe impairment (4.2%). Impairment criteria were based on the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
<br>ADHD affected three times as many males (13.0%) as females (4.2%).

<br>

<br>Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), Figure 4 shows the estimated prevalence of adults aged 18 to 44 years with a current diagnosis of ADHD.

<br>The overall prevalence of current adult ADHD is 4.4%.
<br>Prevalence was higher for males (5.4%) versus females (3.2%).
<br>The non-Hispanic white group (5.4%) had a higher prevalence than all other race/ethnicity groups.




<br>The estimated lifetime prevalence of ADHD in U.S. adults aged 18 to 44 years was 8.1%.

<br>Autism spectrum disorder&nbsp;(ASD) is characterized by:

<br>Ongoing social problems that include difficulty communicating and interacting with others
<br>Repetitive behaviors as well as limited interests or activities
<br>Symptoms that typically are recognized in the first two years of life
<br>Symptoms that hurt the individual’s ability to function socially, at school or work, or other areas of life

<br>Across the CDC surveillance sites, an average of 1 in every 36 (2.8%) 8-year-old children were estimated to have ASD in 2020.
<br>ASD is 3.8&nbsp;times as prevalent among boys (4.3%) as among girls (1.1%).
<br>ASD is reported to occur in all racial and ethnic groups.

 <br><br>
<br>It is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. 
<br><br>
<br>A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
<br>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:

<br>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 
<br>Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
<br>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 
<br>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 
<br>Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 
<br>Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposelessness in non-global-directed activity).
<br>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).


<br>The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. 
<br>The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition.

<br>Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndrome level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis. 


<br>
<br>Note: Criteria 1-4 constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
<br><br>
<br>A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day. 
<br>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted,, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:

<br>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity

 <br><br><br>
<br>In 1965 George Bach published a book called The Intimate Enemy which was a new approach to couples' therapy. Bach believed that the problem in relationships was that people needed to air their anger rather than suppress it. If they expressed their resentments instead of letting the anger build up, there would be a catharsis that would clear the air between them. 

<br>He even encouraged them to hit one another with soft foam-rubber bats. 
<br>We now know there is no catharsis effect in voicing anger and that Bach's procedure only built resentment. (Read more in Carol Tavris' book, Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion)*


<br>In the 1960 s Lederer and Jackson wrote a book called The Mirages of Marriage.

<br>One of their ideas they called the <a data-href="Quid Pro Quo" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/quid-pro-quo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Quid Pro Quo</a>. It stated that a good relationship is based on reciprocating positive behaviors and that a bad relationship is caused by a breakdown in this implicit contract. 
<br>Their idea led in the 1970 s to the behavioral intervention of contingency contracting, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Contingency Contracting" data-href="Contingency Contracting" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/contingency-contracting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contingency Contracting</a> (otherwise known as the 'give to get'). Therapists would help each person identify what behaviors they wanted to get from the other partner. Then the therapist would help the couple to write a contract for the exchange. 


<br>In 1977, Bernard Murstein showed through research that a reciprocity concept, both in relationships and in friendships, was a hallmark of an ailing relationship. 

<br>People became 'affective accountants' when a relationship was not working well. When things were going well, they would think, "I did this for them..." whereas when the relationship is going well, they do not think of this contingency of positivity. 


<br>We now know that the focus on resolution of conflict is misguided. Gottman's research revealed that most conflict (69%) in relationships is perpetual.

<br>It has no resolution. It is based on lasting differences in personalities and needs. Couples can either dialogue about these perpetual issues or live in a state of 'gridlock,' in a state of painful impasse. 
<br>Therapy needs to emphasize helping couples to manage conflicts rather than to resolve them. 


<br>In happy, lasting relationships, the approach towards conflict is gentle. 

<br>Example:

<br>Partners soften the way they bring up an issue
<br>They accept influence from one another
<br>They have a 5-to-1 ratio of positive-to-negative affect during conflict regardless of the type of relationship they have (from volatile to conflict avoiding)
<br>They consistently communicate acceptance of one another
<br>They keep their level of physiological arousal low
<br>They preempt negativity in the interaction
<br>They repair the interaction and de-escalate if it does become negative
<br>They move gently toward compromise




<br>In relationships that are ailing and failing there is either an escalation of negative affect, a lack of positive affect, or a state of emotional disengagement.

<br>For more information, read John Gottman's book What Predicts Divorce


<br>Not all relationship conflict is the same. 

<br>Some conflicts are real deal-breakers. 
<br>They contain a 'hidden agenda.'
<br>Partners have the same argument over and over again. 
<br>Each person's position is embedded with deep personal meaning, an existential foundation, so that compromise seems completely unthinkable. 

<br>Example:

<br>Partners may be talking about the budget, but instead they need to be talking about what money means to them, using concepts like freedom, power, love, and justice. 






<br>Couples' therapy in the 1970s had a strong behavioral and cognitive base in which it was assumed that the therapist was the rational and calm one. In contrast, the couple was viewed as emotional and therefore out of control. 

<br>Following <a data-href="Murray Bowen" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/murray-bowen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Murray Bowen</a>'s ideas, the therapist's job was to help the couple control their feelings and to become less 'enmeshed' (<a data-href="Enmeshment" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/structural-family-therapy/key-terms-and-concepts/enmeshment.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Enmeshment</a>) and more 'differentiated' (<a data-href="Differentiation of Self" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/bowen-family-system-theory/key-terms-and-concepts/differentiation-of-self.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Differentiation of Self</a>).

<br>By 'differentiated' Bowen meant that the partners would control their emotions using reason. 
<br>The therapist was assisting each partner's cerebal cortex in gaining dominance over the limbic system. It was emotion versus reason, and ideally reason should win. 
<br>According to this view, the therapist was supporting the process of evolution. 


<br>(Here Gottman says Bowen is wrong.) In the brain there is an integration of emotion and reason, even in the cerebral cortex. Without emotion, problems do not get solved very well. 

<br>Expressing emotion does not mean being 'out of control.' In fact, emotion is central to the understanding and treatment of couples' relationships. 
<br>The nature of emotional interaction predicts what happens to a relationship. 
<br>Gottman developed the Secific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)
<br>Gottman is influenced by <a data-href="@bowlbyAttachmentLoss1999" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/@bowlbyAttachmentLoss1999" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@bowlbyAttachmentLoss1999</a>, <a data-href="Sue Johnson" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Sue Johnson" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sue Johnson</a>and her <a data-href="Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/other-therapy-theories/emotionally-focused-therapy-(eft)/emotionally-focused-therapy-(eft).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)</a>.
<br>Affect is not the problem, it is central for understanding, compassion, and change. 

<br>The couples' therapist needs to become an expert on emotion, and on helping couples establish emotional connection. 

<br>Read more with Susan Johnson's books.








<br>Beginning in 1964 with the formation of the Society for Psychophysiological Research, the study of emotion and physiology has added to our understanding of the automatic and neurological basis of emotion and how emotion and thoughts are integrated in the brain. 

<br>Once people become automatically aroused into a state of alarm and defense which we call <a data-href="Diffuse Physiological Arousal" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/clinic-resources/training/gottman/level-1/diffuse-physiological-arousal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diffuse Physiological Arousal</a>, there are severe limits on the ability to process information, to listen, to laugh, to be affectionate, to be empathetic, and to be creative.

<br>To read more, see Joseph LeDoux's book, The Emotional Brain, Dan Goleman's book, Emotional Intelligence, Dan Siegel's book, The Developing Mind, and Jaak Panksepp's book Affective Neuroscience.




<br>Building positive affect both during conflict and in general in the relationship (in everyday interaction) turns out to be essential to ensure lasting change. 

<br>At first this awareness was implemented superficially, with '<a data-href="Love Days" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Love Days" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Love Days</a>' designed by the therapist to increase positive behavior between people. But love days did not change positive affect during conflict. 

<br>Even outside of the conflict context, we have learned that this increase in positivity needs to be a therapeutic focus implemented through improving both the couple's friendship and their secure attachment to one another. 

<br>This can be accomplished through work on turning toward bids for emotional connection, building emotional intimacy, and building other positive affect systems such as courtship, romance, lust, sex, play, fun, and adventure. These positive affect systems must be built and maintained intentionally, as part of the therapy. 






<br>Couples need to identify and communicate their sense of purpose, the meaning of how they move through time together, their priorities and values, what they hold to be sacred, their goals and missions, their ethics, morality, philosophy of life and religion, and their legacy from their families and cultures, so together, they can build an existential base to their lives. 

<br>To read more see Doherty's book, The Intentional Family.


<br>A large mismatch that can trouble couple relationships centers on how people feel about feelings, which we call 'meta-emotion.' 

<br>To help couples with these mismatches, we need to understand people's experience and relationship to specific affects like anger, sadness, fear, contempt, pride, affection, love, joy, excitement, humor, amusement, adventure, safety, security, and panic. 
<br>We also need to understand their trauma. 
<br>We need to grasp their philosophy about emotion and emotional exploration, and enhance their bodily awareness and emotional fluency with what Eugene Gendlin called 'focusing.'

<br>To read more, read Eugene Gendlin's book Focusing, Gottman &amp; DeClaire's book, Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child, and Gottman, Katz, &amp; Hooven's Meta-emotion.




<br>Therapy for failing relationships must involve accomplishing three goals:

<br>Down-regulating negative affect and its escalation during conflict
<br>Increasing positive affect in conflict
<br>Increasing positive affect outside of conflict


<br><br><br><br>
<br>Lederer &amp; Jackson proposed The Quid Pro Quo contract as an implicit contract that every relationship contains. It is a contract in which people exchange positive things with one another. 

<br>They suggested this kind of reciprocity breaks down in relationships that are ailing, and trust becomes eroded. 


<br>In 1977 Bernard Murstein found that quid-pro-quo way of thinking was characteristic of both ailing friendships and relationships. 
<br>Once a partner becomes an emotional 'accountant' there is something wrong. (i.e., when the thinking is, "I did this for that person and it never got reciprocated,"), then that is a sign that the relationship is in trouble. 
<br><br>
<br>Suggested by Frank Pittman. 
<br>Gigy &amp; Kelly in the California Divorce Mediation Project discovered that the major cause of divorce (80% of the time) is that people become emotionally distant and drift apart. 
<br>Most book about affairs claim that affairs are not usually about sex, but about finding someone who offers friendship and affection. 
<br><br>
<br>The idea is that men need and want to have sex with many partners, but women need security and constant love with just one partner, so gender differences in sexual needs erode relationships. 
<br>Sociologists estimate that affair rates for men and women are now about equal. 
<br>Historically, the practice of monogamy was designed by men, not for women, for the purpose of ascertaining paternity to enable inheritance of property. 
<br><br>
<br>This idea was popularized by John Gray in the Mars Venus books. The theory is that men are task-oriented and not emotional (Mars) and women are affiliative and emotional (Venus) and not task-oriented. This hypothesis was originally proposed by Bales and Parsons in the 1950s. 
<br><br>
<br>Dominance structures in relationships produce dysfunction. 
<br>Research has shown that there is more conflict when people must work out who is in charge of each thing in contrast to when there are clear gender lines on who does what. 

<br>Dominance structures in social groups are designed to minimize conflict. 
<br>When relationships are purposely aiming for equality and the lack of control of one person by another, the important dimensions related to happiness with the relationship are:

<br>The perception of fairness
<br>Emotional responsiveness to one another. 




<br><br>
<br>A 'female-demand/male-withdraw' pattern or a 'female-pursuer/male-distancer' pattern is dysfunctional. This one is true. Andy Christensen has pioneered the research in this area of couple relationships. 
<br><br>
<br>The inability to change one another's behavior in a relationship is dysfunctional. 
<br>Now its major proponents (Andrew Christensen, Neil Jacobson) emphasize acceptance as well as change. They argue that the most serious problem in relationships occurs when people don't feel accepted for who they are. 
<br><br>
<br>Poor problem solving and inadequate conflict resolution are dysfunctional. 
<br>Our research reveals that this idea is a myth. 
<br>Most conflicts are never resolved, including in happy relationships. They remain perpetual problems that couples either continue to cope with through dialogue or become gridlocked about. 
<br><br>
<br>Mind-reading is dysfunctional. 

<br>This was the central part of Paul Watzalwick's theory. 


<br>People should not try to attribute thoughts, feelings, and motives to their partner. 
<br>In our research, mind-reading was seen to act as a feeling probe if delivered with some positive affect (like affection).
<br><br>
<br>A lack of meta-communicating is dysfunctional for relationships. 

<br>This came from the seminal paper by Bateson, Watzelwick, Beavin, &amp; Jackson on the role of the <a data-href="Double Bind" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/double-bind.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Double Bind</a> message between a schizophrenic and his mother. 


<br>Our observational research demonstrated that there was no relationship between meta-communicative statements and any outcome variable. 

<br>The effect of the meta-communicative statements depended on the affect with which it was delivered. 


<br><br>
<br>Example:

<br>A person who needs to be domineering must find someone who needs to be submissive and then a happy relationship will result. 

<br>There is little support for this hypothesis in the JMF decade reviews. 




<br>Residues of Issues in Families of Origins

<br>A common view in early Freudian analysis was that healthy relationships are not possible unless neuroses in one's primary family are first resolved. 
<br>Research evidence has never supported this hypothesis. 


<br>Projective Identification

<br>Most couple conflict is the result of projection. 
<br>Most conflict in relationships is about how the couple relates to one another, usually during ordinary moments, and the issues raised are usually conscious ones like those involving respect, affection, autonomy, and interdependence.

<br>Reinforcement Erosion

<br>Neil Jacobson suggested that relationships start off happy with partners highly important and reinforcing for one another, but over time 'reinforcement erosion' occurs and that is the source of couple dysfunction. 
<br>We have found that in long-term relationships people become more important to one another, not less, and small acts of kindness have even greater impact. 


<br>High Expectations

<br>People's high expectations lead to disappointments that can be avoided by lowering standards about what to expect in a relationship. 
<br>People who expect to be treated well in a relationship get treated well. those who lower their expectations also get what they expect - less. 


<br><br>
<br>The following are eight predictors of divorce and/or continued couple misery that are characteristic of relationships when they are attempting to resolve conflict, and hence can be considered 'dysfunctional.'
<br><br>
<br>During conflict discussions, the ratio of positive to negative interactions in stable relationships is 5:1, not 0.8:1 as it is in couples headed for divorce. 
<br>The presence of positive affect itself during conflict resolution (and in everyday interaction) is critical. 
<br>Couples therapy should not declare war on negativity. 
<br>All emotions have adaptive value. (Charles Darwin)
<br>All emotions and all wishes are acceptable, but not all behavior may be acceptable. (Haim Ginott)
<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Criticism" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Criticism" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Criticism</a>
<br><a data-href="Defensiveness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Defensiveness" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Defensiveness</a>
<br><a data-href="Contempt" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Contempt" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contempt</a>
<br><a data-href="Stonewalling" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Stonewalling" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stonewalling</a>
<br>It is the escalation of negativity that predicted divorce. This pattern was related to a pattern known as 'turning away' from bids for emotional connection. 
<br><br>
<br>Both the absence of escalated negative affect during conflict, and the absence of any positive affect during conflict as well. 
<br>There was a marked lack of affection, shared humor, question-asking, active interest, excitement, joy, support, and empathy. 
<br>This pattern was related to a negative style in everyday interaction that we called 'turning against' bids for emotional connection. 
<br><br>
<br>The goal of therapy ought not to be helping couples to avoid fights, even ones that are painful and alienating. 
<br>The goal of therapy ought to be to help couples process these inevitable fights and moments of miscommunication or hurt feelings, and to be able to repair the relationship. Regrettable incidents in interaction are inevitable, just par for the course. 
<br><br>
<br>Robert Weiss (1980) defined the concepts of positive and negative sentiment override. 

<br>In negative sentiment override there is a discrepancy between insider and outsider perceptions of the interaction. 
<br>An actual negative message is interpreted by the partner as negative. 
<br>Negative sentiment overrides positive interaction. 
<br>In negative sentiment override negative perception is 'the subtext' that accompanies interactions. 
<br>Negative sentiment override is related to the development of negative attributions about one another and the relationship. 


<br>Fritz Heider's 'fundamental attribution error' is related to these findings. 

<br>He described a tendency in people to minimize their own errors and attribute them to temporary, fleeting circumstances, but to maximize the errors of others and attribute them to lasting, negative personality traits or character flaws. 


<br><br>
<br>Men are more likely than women to rehearse distress-maintaining thoughts that may prolong physiological arousal and vigilance. Flooding and The Distance and Isolation Cascade accompanies arousal. 
<br><br>
<br>Physiological arousal may cause: 

<br>Increased heart rate 
<br>Increased myocardial contractility
<br>Increased vasoconstriction
<br>Increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activation
<br>Increased rennin-angiotensin activity
<br>Reduced oxygen concentration in the blood
<br>Decreased blood supply to non-essential functions like the gut and kidney
<br>Catecholamine and cortisol secretion
<br>Increased amygdala activation
<br>Decreased frontal lobe activation
<br>Immunosuppression


<br>When physiological arousal accompanies relationship conflict, it may lead to:

<br>A decrease in one's ability to take in information (reduced hearing, reduced peripheral vision, problems with shifting attention away from a defensive posture)
<br>An increase in <a data-href="Defensiveness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Defensiveness" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Defensiveness</a> and the 'summarizing yourself syndrome'
<br>A reduction in the ability to be creative in problem-solving
<br>A reduction in the ability to listen and empathize. 


<br><br>
<br>This may show up as either:

<br>Male emotional disengagement (this eventually becomes mutual emotional disengagement)
<br>Male escalation (belligerence, <a data-href="Contempt" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Contempt" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Contempt</a>, <a data-href="Defensiveness" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Defensiveness" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Defensiveness</a>) in response to his partner's low intensity negative affect (complaining).


<br><br><br>
<br>In 1974 Harold Raush published the first observational longitudinal study of the transition to parenthood, and the first to use sequential analysis of interaction. 

<br>He divided his couples into three groups:

<br>Harmonious
<br>Conflict Avoiding
<br>Bickering


<br>He suggested that the two extreme styles of conflict (avoiding and bickering) were dysfunctional. 


<br>In our own research, we found that all three styles (which we called Avoiders, Validators, and Volatiles) were all functional (stable, happy), if and only if the ratio of positive to negative interaction during conflict was greater than or equal to 5:1. 

<br>Mismatches between preferred conflict styles in married couples did predict divorce. 

<br>These mismatches were at the root of <a data-href="Demand-Withdraw (Pursuer-Distancer)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/demand-withdraw-(pursuer-distancer).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Demand-Withdraw (Pursuer-Distancer)</a> .
<br>Relationships that are mismatched have particular perpetual issues to deal with. They are not automatically doomed, but without intevention this mismatch in preferred conflict style is a risk factor that predicts dissolution. 
<br>In therapy this mismatch gives the therapist an important goal of the treatment - establishing dialogue rather than gridlock with this perpetual problem.


<br>A conflict avoider paired with a validator was the most common mismatch. 


<br><br>
<br>Only 31% of couples' major areas of continuing disagreement were about resolvable issues. 
<br>69% of the time they were about unresolved perpetual issues. 
<br>Functional problem solving about resolvable issues had the following characteristics:

<br>The active listening model of functional relationship received little or no support when scientifically studied. 
<br>In real relationship conflicts there was little evidence that anything like active listening was actually used very often, nor did it predict relationship outcome. 
<br>The masters of relationships used softened startup versus harsh startup when raising an issue. 

<br>The woman's role was critical since women bring up issues in heterosexual relationships 80% of the time. 
<br>The choice of using harsh or softened startup was predictable by how positively responsive or rejecting men were during the events-of-the-day conversation that preceded the conflict discussion. 

<br>Responsive men had wives who softened their startup during conflict. 




<br>Masters of relationships accepted influence rather than 'batting it back (escalation).'

<br>The man's role was critical here because most women tended to accept influence at high rates. 


<br>Masters of relationships had repair attempts that were effective, and they repaired at a lower threshold of negativity than the disasters of relationships.

<br>They also did preemptive repair.

 <br>
<br>History and Ethical Principles:

<br>Introduction:

<br>The foundation of the federal regulations that govern the protection of human subjects in research can be found, in large part, in the ethical principles detailed in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>Belmont Report<br><br><br>
<br>The ethical principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

<br><a data-href="Respect for Persons" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/respect-for-persons.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Respect for Persons</a>:Respect for Persons<br><br><br>
<br>This principle includes two requirements:

<br>Acknowledge and treat individuals as autonomous. 
<br>Protect those with limited autonomy. 



<br><a data-href="Beneficence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/beneficence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Beneficence</a>:Beneficence<br><br><br>
<br>Two general rules reflect this principle:

<br>Do no harm. 
<br>Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. 



<br><a data-href="Justice" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/justice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice</a>:Justice<br><br><br>
<br>This principle requires researchers to:

<br>Treat people fairly. 
<br>Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. 





<br>Balancing the Three Principles:

<br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
<br>In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit)


<br>Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects:

<br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. 

<br>Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review:

<br>IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following:

<br>Risks to subjects are minimized:

<br>By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
<br>Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. 


<br>Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. 

<br>In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.


<br>Selection of subjects is equitable. 

<br>In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons).


<br>Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. 
<br>Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. 
<br>When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. 
<br>When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. 
<br>For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations:

<br>Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. 
<br>Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. 
<br>If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. 








<br>When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. 
<br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research. The criteria reflect the ethical principles identified in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>. 


.




<br>Informed Consent:

<br>People have the right to expect that researchers will treat them as autonomous individuals, respecting their decisions about whether to take part in research and about what personal information they will or will not share with others. This is accomplished through a thorough informed consent process that is presented in a language understandable to the research subject. 
<br>The Consent Process:

<br>The federal regulations about informed consent list elements of information that the researcher must provide to subjects. The regulations divide the elements into two categories. One category includes basic elements to be provided to all subjects. The second set includes elements that must be provided, when appropriate. 
<br>Consent should begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a subject in understanding the research, what is expected of them, and the potential risks of harm and benefits. Regulations require that this information be understandable to the subject and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. The emphasis on subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) comprehension and presenting information that a 'reasonable person' would want to have in order to make an informed decision to participate, and providing an opportunity to discuss. 
<br>This 'key information' is not defined in the regulation, but examples of key information were provided in the preamble to the revised Common Rule:

<br>The fact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary. 
<br>The purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective subject's participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research. 
<br>The reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the prospective subject. 
<br>The benefits to the prospective subject or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research. 
<br>Appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the prospective subject. 




<br>General Requirements of Informed Consent:

<br>A statement that the study involves research

 <br><br><br>
<br>The acute phase of a suicidal crisis is when a person is ready to actually make an attempt to end their life. 
<br>Suicidal crises are often brief. 
<br>While some attempts follow a long period of deliberation, other attempts are acted on hastily and may be difficult to predict. 
<br>Most people who attempt suicide don't necessarily want to be dead, but they want the pain they feel to stop. 
<br>Most people who attempt suicide and survive do not ultimately kill themselves - even people who make a very serious suicide attempt.
<br><br>
<br>Acute Suicidal Crisis: The period when a person transitions from being at risk for suicide or considering suicide to being ready to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;make an attempt.
<br><br>
<br>Can come on rapidly
<br>Can be difficult to predict
<br>Can lead to an unplanned suicide attempt
<br>People were asked when they has first started thinking about making an attempt; 48% said they starting thinking about it within 10 minutes of attempting. 
<br>Often brief

<br>The period during which a person is actually ready to take their life is usually brief. Rarely is it a chronic state. The impulse to die often fades. It may never recur, or it may flare up episodically. 
<br>Duration of Suicidal Crisis:

<br>Evidence by Attempters:

<br>0-10 minutes: 48%
<br>11-60 minutes: 2%
<br>1-24 hours: 9%
<br>1-7 days: 16%
<br>1-4 weeks: 15%
<br>1-12 months: 11%




<br>Long-Term Survival:

<br>More than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not actually kill themselves. 
<br>60% of people who commit suicide die on their first attempt. (Means reduction saves lives by decreasing the likelihood that an attempt will be fatal)

<br>In describing the moment he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, Ken Baldwin said, "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped."






<br><br><br>
<br>It is not easy to determine. 
<br>Examples:

<br>Clients who have suicidal thoughts. 
<br>Clients who are in distress and have attempted suicide in the past. 
<br>Clients who are struggling with mental health or substance misuse issues, especially if they are also coping with painful life crises.


<br><br>
<br>A clinician should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and feelings. Talking about suicide does not create or increase risk, in fact, it can reduce the risk of suicide.
<br><br>
<br>A clinician’s ability to calmly, compassionately, and matter-of-factly explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors may encourage an individual to disclose suicidality, if it exists. Often, clients who have considered suicide will be relieved that you raised the subject.
<br><br>
<br>Use direct questions about current or past suicidal thoughts and behavior. 
<br>Let the client know that other people have similar thoughts and feelings.
<br>Any of your clients who have a prior history of suicidality or current distress could benefit from lethal means counseling.
<br><br>
<br>If your conversation with your client results in disclosure of past suicidal thoughts or behaviors, probe more about current suicidal feelings. Find out specific details about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

<br>Some Questions to Ask:

<br>Tell me about a couple of times in the past few months when things were the worst for you—did you think about suicide?

<br>If yes, then ask:&nbsp;Did you take any specific steps toward an attempt? What methods did you think about? What kept you alive?&nbsp;


<br>Tell me about the last couple of days—how much would you say suicide has been on your mind, if at all?&nbsp;

<br>If so, then ask:&nbsp;Are there specific methods you’ve thought about?


<br>Have you thought about how you'd kill yourself?&nbsp;

<br>If yes, then ask: Have you thought about when or where you'd kill yourself?
<br>If they mention a specific method of suicide, then ask: What other methods are you thinking about?


<br>Is there a specific scenario where you think you would attempt suicide?
<br>Have you ever attempted suicide in the past, or started to?




<br><br>
<br>Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. Lethal means counseling makes sense for anyone at risk.
<br>Individuals who struggle with mental health and/or substance use issues, and who are experiencing a major crisis, stress, or trauma, are also at risk of suicide and should receive lethal means training.
<br><br>
<br>Individuals who currently have suicidal thoughts would benefit from lethal means counseling. 
<br>Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress would benefit from lethal means counseling. 
<br>Individuals who struggle with mental health/substance abuse issues, especially when they are also experiencing painful life crises, would benefit from lethal means counseling. 
<br>Ask clients at risk directly about suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. 
<br>Ask clients at-risk specifically about their suicide plans, such as how and when they would do it. 
<br>Don't rely solely on disclosure of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and plans. People sometimes deny these even when they exist. Also, suicidal thoughts can emerge rapidly and many attempts are unplanned. 
<br>Lethal means counseling should take place before a suicidal crisis occurs. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Firearms is the method used most frequently in suicidal deaths. 
<br>Suicidal Death Rates by Method:

<br>51% Firearms
<br>26% Suffocation/Hanging
<br>12% Poisoning/Overdose (Poisoning from intentional drug or medication overdoses)
<br>3% Gas Inhalation (Inhaling gas, usually carbon monoxide from motor exhaust)
<br>2% Jumping/Falling (Jump from high place like bridge)
<br>2% Cutting (Sharp instruments like razor)
<br>4% Other Methods (like drowning)


<br><br><br>
<br>The lethality of the method used in a suicide attempt is one of the biggest factors determining whether the person lives or dies. While the intent matters, means also matters. 
<br>If the method a person wants to use for suicide if not available when they are actually ready to go through with an attempt, one of two things is likely to occur:

<br>They will delay the attempt as they try to get access to the method they want to use. The greater the delay, the greater the chance the suicidal crisis will pass. 
<br>They will substitute another method. If the substituted method is less lethal, this increases the chance the person will not die. And most people who survive an attempt do not later go on to kill themselves. 


<br>The two methods used in the majority of nonfatal suicidal attempts are overdosing with medications and cutting with sharp instruments. Many people think these two methods are far more deadly than they actually are. This misperception may save a lot of lives.
<br>We recommend that you do not share specific information with your clients about the low lethality of sharp instruments and medications.
<br><br>
<br>Which suicide methods are amenable to a means reduction approach? It depends on the following criteria:

<br>Number of Suicide Deaths:

<br>The number/percent of suicide deaths caused by a specific method. 


<br>Lethality:

<br>The proportion of attempts by a given method that end in death (case fatality rate).


<br>Irreversibility:

<br>The inability for someone attempting suicide to stop once it has begun or to be rescued. More people stop an attempt than carry through with it. 


<br>Accessibility:

<br>The immediate availability of the method. Access is particularly important when attempts occur rapidly with little or no planning. 


<br>Acceptability:

<br>Cultural and/or individual tolerance or preference for using a particular method to kill oneself. 




<br>Cutting:

<br>Low Number of Deaths
<br>Low Lethality
<br>Low Irreversibility
<br>High Accessibility
<br>High Acceptability


<br>Jumping/Falling:

<br>Low Number of Deaths
<br>High Lethality
<br>High Irreversibility
<br>Low Accessibility
<br>Low Acceptability


<br>Gas Inhalation:

<br>Low Number of Deaths
<br>Moderate Lethality
<br>Low Irreversibility
<br>Moderate Accessibility
<br>Low Acceptability


<br>Poisoning/Overdose:

<br>Moderate Number of Deaths
<br>Low Lethality
<br>Low Irreversibility
<br>High Accessibility
<br>High Acceptability


<br>Suffocation/Hanging:

<br>Moderate Number of Deaths
<br>Moderate Lethality
<br>Low Irreversibility
<br>High Accessibility
<br>Moderate Acceptability


<br>Firearms:

<br>High Number of Deaths
<br>High Lethality
<br>High Irreversibility
<br>High Accessibility
<br>High Acceptability


<br><br>
<br>Firearms are used in more suicide deaths in the US than all other methods combined. They are also highly lethal irreversible, and easily accessible in many homes with guns (one-third of homes have guns). Since gun owners can voluntarily undertake steps to reduce access, you will want to discuss safe firearm storage with all clients at-risk of suicide. 
<br>Medication Overdoses are not as lethal as firearms (though some medications and poisons are very lethal). It is also usually possible for someone to stop an overdose mid-attempt or to be rescued. However, overdose is by far the most frequent method of attempt, and medications are easily accessible in most homes. Therefore, it is wise to routinely advise at-risk clients to dispose of unnecessary medications and keep accessible only quantities that do not pose a lethal threat. 
<br>When your client's suicidal ideation focuses on any other method, you will want to discuss with them ways to reduce access to that method. 
<br><br>
<br>
More suicide deaths are from firearms than any other method in the US. 

<br>
Firearms, jumping, and suffocation are most lethal than other methods. 

<br>
Cutting and poisoning/overdose have low lethality, on average.

<br>
The method used in a suicide attempt can determine whether the person lives or dies. 

<br>
Use a method reduction approach for any lethal method that is mentioned by clients at risk. 

<br>
How amenable each method is to a means reduction approach depends on the following criteria:

<br>Frequency
<br>Lethality
<br>Irreversibility
<br>Accessibility
<br>Acceptability


<br>
Since firearms are used in most suicide deaths and they are also highly lethal, acceptable, and accessible (in homes with guns), be sure to ask all clients at risk if they have access to firearms and discuss ways to reduce access. 

<br>A method is considered lethal if a high proportion of attempts by that method end in death.
<br>Approximately 80%-90% of intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates.
<br>Only 1%-2% of intentional, self-inflicted wounds from sharp instruments, like a razor, are fatal. Cutting is not a highly lethal method. However, it is the second most commonly used method in attempts. 
<br>Only 1%-2% of intentional overdoses or poisonings are fatal, according to data from emergency departments and death certificates. This is on average, however, certain medications and poisons are far more lethal than others. In addition, medication overdoses are the most common method of suicidal attempts. 


<br><br><br><br>
<br>People who attempt suicide typically struggle with ongoing mental health or substance abuse issues.
<br>While some attempts are planned, many are not. Acute suicidal crises are often brief, and escalation from thought to action can occur rapidly.
<br>The lethality of the method used in an attempt can determine whether that person lives or dies. If a highly lethal means is not available, the individual's chance of survival is greater. 
<br>Over 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive do not take their life later on, so reducing access to lethal means can save many lives.
<br>An effective way to protect clients at risk of suicide is to reduce their access to highly lethal means before they experience an acute suicidal crisis. 
<br><br>
<br>Feasibility:

<br>Can the client or their family actually take the steps at home to reduce access to the method?


<br>Reducing access to&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;and&nbsp;medications used for poisoning/overdose&nbsp;could feasibly be accomplished at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so could potentially save thousands of lives in the U.S. if routinely implemented with people at risk for suicide.
<br>Access can be feasibly be reduced for these two methods:

<br>Firearms:

<br>Firearms are used in roughly half of all suicide deaths, are highly lethal, and are very accessible if they are kept at home. 


<br>Medications:

<br>Medication overdoses are by far the most common method in suicide attempts. Although the vast majority do not result in death, some medications and medication combinations are highly lethal - and, if kept unlocked at home, very accessible. 




<br>We recommend routinely discussing firearm and medication storage with all clients at risk of suicide. If a client's suicidal ideation focuses on a method other than firearms or medication, we also recommend discussing ways to reduce access to that method as well. 
<br><br><br>
<br>When discussing firearm storage with clients and their family members, the goal is to maximize the client’s safety by reducing immediate access to firearms as much as possible while they are at risk for suicide. There are two main options for reducing access to firearms.
<br>Safest: Store firearms away from the home:

<br>Storing firearms away from home is the most effective way to ensure clients don't have easy access to a gun if they experience a spike in suicidal feelings. Off-site options are listed in the next section.


<br>Second-best: Secure storage inside the home:

<br>The second-best option is securely locking firearms in the home (or disassembling guns and locking a critical component). The person at risk should not have the keys, know where the keys are kept, or know the combination to the storage unit. Keep in mind that safes and locks can be broken into or picked, some more easily than others. But any measures that put time and distance between a suicidal person and a firearm may save their life.


<br><br>
<br>Storing firearms away from the home temporarily until the person improves is the best way to reduce access to them. 
<br>Self-Storage Rental Units:

<br>Many facilities allow firearm storage. Typically, the smallest units are 5 ft. By 5 ft., but some offer storage drawers or bins, which are less expensive. Prices typically include a small one-time administrative fee as well as a monthly charge that depends on unit size. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored in a facility.


<br>Friends or Relatives:

<br>Storing firearms with a trusted person is an excellent and free option, provided the person is legally allowed to hold them. Some state laws require a background check prior to transfer to ensure the individual is not prohibited from possessing firearms.


<br>Shooting Ranges:

<br>Shooting ranges and sportsmen’s clubs sometimes offer locker rentals for a relatively low monthly fee. Typically, only the owner holds the key and no background check is required because the ownership of the guns is not transferred. Guns should be unloaded and locked when stored.


<br>Law Enforcement:

<br>Some law enforcement agencies will temporarily store firearms for safety purposes; others will not. It is best to know the processes and policies in your region before you need to implement these with a client. You or your client should contact the agency first; walking in unannounced with firearms could be mistaken as a threat. Some agencies will pick up the firearms at the person’s home. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required. Most agencies offer disposal services, if that is desired.


<br>Gun Shops:

<br>Some gun shops offer storage services, and a few specialize in this service (e.g., provide pick-up services, offer discounts for longer-term and multiple gun storage). Prices vary, although some shops will provide regular customers with free storage when there is a safety concern. A background check to retrieve the firearms may be required, depending on the type of storage the shop uses.


<br>Pawn Shops:

<br>Pawning guns for a small loan amount can be a relatively low-cost, secure storage option in most states. Interest charges must be paid monthly. To reclaim their firearms, gun owners must repay the loan and go through a background check to verify they are not prohibited from owning firearms.


<br><br>
<br>Clients and family members who decide to store their firearms away from their house usually want to know when it’s safe enough to bring their firearms back into the home.

<br>"Yes. … It’s a case-by-case decision based on how the client is doing. Acute suicidal feelings can spike episodically. While these spikes are often brief, they can recur. It is prudent to wait until there has been a relatively long period of stability before returning the guns."


<br><br>
<br>Temporary storage of firearms away from the home cannot always be arranged immediately and isn’t always acceptable to the client or others in the home.
<br><br>
<br>Store in a gun safe or lock box:

<br>Lock guns, unloaded, in a gun safe or lock box. Many gun owners have multiple guns and ALL of them should be locked up, including rifles and self-defense guns. 


<br>Remove a component:

<br>Remove a key component of the guns (such as the slides or firing pins) and lock them up - or better yet, store them away from the home. 


<br>Use Gun Locks:

<br>Trigger locks, cable locks, and clamshell locks aren't as safe as locking in a secure gun safe, but they are better than not locking it at all - and when used in conjunction with a safe, can provide an additional layer of protection. 


<br>Change the Combination or Key:

<br>If guns are already locked, change the combination or key location in case the person at risk knows how to access them. 


<br>Remove Ammunition:

<br>Remove ammunition from ALL firearms. Keep all ammunition out of the home for now - or, at least, locked separately.


<br>Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
<br>We recommend triple safety when storing them in the home: Locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked up separately (Ideally away from the home while the client is at risk)
<br>What About a Self-Defense Gun?

<br>In some situations, clients or members of their household may want to keep their gun available for self-defense purposes. If this is the case, how you approach the situation and what you say will depend on whether the gun owner or the household member is the person at risk.


<br><br>
<br>Person At Risk:

<br>If the gun owner is the person at risk:

<br>Discuss the specific threats that are a concern to the client and the realistic risk of home invasion crimes.
<br>Find out what other means of protection they would consider, such as self-defense sprays (if legal in your state), flood lights, an alarm system, or a dog.
<br>Discuss what they are willing to do to keep themselves safe from suicide.&nbsp;
<br>Would the client consider locking a self-defense gun and having another family member hold the key? If there’s resistance, consider creative solutions, such as putting pictures of loved ones or other reminders of reasons to live on their gun or lock box to interrupt or slow down a suicidal impulse. Work toward additional steps to reduce access over time.




<br>Household Member:

<br>If the gun owner is a member of the household:

<br>First, discuss the probabilities of suicide attempt versus risk of home invasion in the near term (i.e., the risk of a violent home invasion is very small for most people and is dwarfed by the far greater risk of suicide if a despairing person has a gun close at hand)
<br>If the gun owner is concerned about protecting family members, it may be helpful to mention that part of protecting them is keeping everyone safe from suicide.
<br>If self-defense is determined to be essential, one option is for the gun owner to keep the firearm either on them or in a quick-release handgun safe to which the person at risk has no access.




<br><br><br><br>
<br>Overdose accounts for roughly two-thirds of suicide attempts treated in the hospital, but only a very small proportion (2% or less) prove fatal. However, some medications are more dangerous than others, especially when taken in combination. With over 250,000 attempts annually, at least 5,000 people die each year from an intentional overdose.
<br><br>
<br>According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the medications most frequently involved in overdose suicides are opioids (e.g., prescription pain medications such as oxycodone, methadone, and morphine). 5&nbsp; In suicide deaths by drug overdose, over half tested positive for an opioid. 6&nbsp;Opioids, when used alone or in combination with other types of drugs or alcohol can cause death by depressing the respiratory system.
<br><br>
<br>Other drugs that are frequently implicated in overdose deaths include benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolytics and muscle relaxants), antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping pills (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially diphenhydramine—Benadryl), and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). These substances usually do not appear alone but rather in combination with an opioid, with one another, and/or with alcohol. Alcohol use can increase the lethality of an overdose and may increase the risk that the person will carry through with an attempt.
<br>Unfortunately, information about lethal combinations of medications is readily available on the Internet.
<br><br><br>
<br>Safely dispose of all unneeded and outdated medication in the home. 
<br><br>
<br>Opioids should not be kept at home unless absolutely necessary to manage pain.

<br>If opioids must be kept at home, they should be locked and inaccessible to the person at risk. If the at-risk client must take the opioids to manage pain, discuss the possibility of having another household member or support person dispense the pills. 
<br>In high-risk situations involving opioid use, also keep at least two doses of Narcan Nasal Spray, which is a highly effective rescue drug that lay people can administer. When used in time, Narcan can immediately reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.


<br><br>
<br>Always lock up abuse-prone drugs such as prescription painkillers, anxiety medications, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Many inexpensive lock boxes can easily be broken into. A steel toolbox secured by a padlock is a safe, inexpensive option.
<br><br>
<br>For other necessary medications (both over-the-counter and prescription), only keep on hand limited quantities that would not constitute a serious danger if taken together. Lock up the rest.
<br><br>
<br>Advise families to ask their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what constitutes a safe quantity of medication to have in their home. The Poison Control Hotline at 800-222-1222 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) can also provide guidance on safe quantities. A family member or support person should seek this information, not the person at risk for suicide, since the information could be used to increase the lethality of an attempt.
<br><br><br>
<br>Use lower-toxicity rather than higher-toxicity medications, if possible, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant rather than a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant.
<br><br>
<br>Limit medication to quantities and combinations that, even if taken all at once, will not do serious harm.

<br>Consider requiring weekly refills to reduce lethality and increase contact.
<br>Take into account the client's use of alcohol and other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. Some combinations are more deadly than others. 


<br><br>
<br>If you have a client with a prescription for psychiatric medications, choose your words carefully so that you don’t send mixed messages or inadvertently inform the person about the lethality of the medications.
<br><br><br>
<br>If a client’s suicidal thoughts focus on methods other than guns or medications, incorporate those methods into your lethal means counseling. For example, if ideation focuses on filling the garage with car exhaust or crashing the car into a telephone pole, and the client has strong suicidal feelings, discuss ways to limit access to the car, such as having a family member hold onto the car keys temporarily.
<br>What if ideation focuses on a certain method?

<br>There are times when a client’s ideation focuses on a very specific method that serves as their escape plan and may also have personally significant meaning. For example, your client carries around a belt that he could use to hang himself like his uncle did. If ideation focuses in this very specific way on one particular item, work with the client on agreeing to give up that item for now, while identifying strategies for staying alive.


<br>What about methods that cannot easily be restricted at home?

<br>Sometimes a client’s ideation focuses on suffocation or other highly lethal methods that are nearly impossible to control access to. These clients may need close supervision from family, friends, or others to ensure they don’t attempt suicide, particularly if their suicidality is of a more chronic or recurring nature. The client may opt to stay in a hospital if they feel the supervision would be helpful.


<br>Just One Part of a Safety Plan:

<br>In all cases, reducing access to lethal means should be part of a broader collaborative safety plan aimed at helping a client learn how to cope with suicidal feelings, as well as part of a broader therapeutic plan aimed at reducing the reasons for dying and increasing the reasons to live.


<br><br><br>
<br>To reduce access to firearms, the safest option is to store them away from the home. Possible storage options include with a relative or friend; with law enforcement; in a self-storage rental unit; or at a gun shop, shooting range, or pawn shop.
<br>To reduce access to firearms that are stored in the home, use triple safety measures: Lock all firearms (or disassemble guns and lock a critical component), unload all firearms, and lock ammunition separately (or don’t keep ammunition at home for now).
<br>Hiding guns in the home is not recommended since family members often know the hiding places.
<br>Guns that are kept at home for self-defense must be addressed since they are usually the ones that are most accessible. 
<br>To reduce access to medications, remove unneeded medications from the home; keep only non-lethal quantities on hand; and lock up abuse-prone drugs, such as prescription painkillers, anxiety pills, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. 
<br>Discuss ways to reduce access to any method a client mentions using. 
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Since escalation to a suicidal crisis can happen rapidly, the goal is to make the home safer for clients at risk before they are actively suicidal.
<br><br>
<br>Counseling on access to lethal means is for three types of clients:
<br>Clients who have recently had suicidal thoughts.
<br>Clients who have attempted suicide in the past and are currently in distress. 
<br>Clients who are struggling with a difficult mental health or substance abuse issue, particularly when they are also coping with a life crisis, such as relationship breakup, housing dislocation, arrest, or financial or job problems. These clients may not be currently suicidal but could become suicidal quickly.
<br><br>
<br>Routinely discus ways to reduce access to firearms and medications routinely with any client at risk of suicide. In addition, discuss any other method that a client with suicidal ideation considers using. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Lethal means counseling is a client-centered intervention, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Your approach and the language you use are important to making this conversation effective, whether speaking to your client or to their friends and family members. 
<br><br>
<br>Have a collaborative conversation and work together. With this approach, the client is the expert and the clinician is a resource. 
<br><br>
<br>Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis as well as the need to reduce access to lethal means. 
<br><br>
<br>Make specific and feasible plans.
<br><br>
<br>Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences.
<br><br>
<br>A guiding approach that is collaborative and client-centered is usually best, such as that used in motivational interviewing. Seek input from the client about their own reasons for - and against - reducing access, their own safety concerns, and what they would be willing to do. A collaborative approach accepts the client's values and works from the client's own motivations. 

<br>"I can see how hard this has been for you lately, and I'm concerned about you. Are you concerned too?"
<br>"What ideas do you have about ways to increase your safety in case you experience suicidal thoughts?"


<br>If your client is a gun owner:

<br>"Lots of people have guns at home. Some will store their guns outside of their home temporarily - such as at a relative's house or a gun shop - until they are feeling better. What do you think about a strategy like that?"


<br><br>
<br>A directive approach has a less collaborative tone and puts the clinician in the role of the expert. With certain clients, this approach may be more appropriate, for example:

<br>Clients who are too overwhelmed or stressed to make clear-headed decisions. 
<br>Clients from certain cultures who may feel more comfortable getting advice rather than being asked for their ideas. 


<br>Examples of Directive Statements:

<br>"I'm going to recommend that for now you store your guns away from home. Is that something you can do?"
<br>"You'd be safer if you stored your guns away from home for now."
<br>"I'm going to suggest you use this gun lock and have your wife keep the key."
<br>"It would be best if you kept only a week's supply of medications at home and had a family member store the rest."
<br>"For now, let's have your partner store your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in a lock box."


<br><br>
<br>No Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts:

<br>Some clients may disclose that they are suffering but say they are not suicidal. This may well be true for some clients; however, others may in fact be suicidal or likely to become so. If the client is having a very difficult time, and especially if life stressors are also present (e.g., custody battle, painful breakup, upcoming prison sentence, housing dislocation, work troubles), engage them in a conversation about reducing access to firearms and medications in case suicidal feelings develop.
<br>Examples of how to respond to clients who say they are not suicidal:

<br>"I'm glad you're not feeling suicidal right now. Sometimes people who are struggling may have a crisis and suddenly experience strong suicidal feelings. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but if it does, I want to be sure you make it through safely and get the help you need. Can we talk over a plan, just in case?"


<br>When clients you suspect are suicidal don't disclose:

<br>"It's not unusual for people who have experienced the kind of pain you are going through recently to feel like it will last forever and to think they would rather be dead. Can we talk over a plan for how you'd stay safe if you started feeling suicidal?"




<br><br>
<br>Some clients, even if they are suicidal, may express resistance to reducing access to lethal means, like firearms. If clients or family members seem resistant, listen to what they say and work collaboratively toward solutions that address their concerns. For instance, some gun owners find the idea of living without a firearm in the home, even temporarily, very difficult. Don’t minimize that this may be a difficult decision.

<br>Examples on how to respond to clients who are in denial or resistant:

<br>When clients won't tell you whether they have a gun:

<br>Will you tell me what you’re worried would happen if you say you have a gun? I may be able to ease those worries.


<br>When clients think you are trying to take their gun away:

<br>"I am not questioning your right to own guns. Since you’ve talked about feeling suicidal, I’m concerned about helping you stay safe. Have you also been concerned?”


<br>When clients are concerned about what will go in their record:

<br>“Before we talk about your specific situation, I can let you know what sort of information I will write down and what I can omit.”


<br>When a client is concerned about chronic pain:

<br>“I hear that you are concerned you won’t have access to your medications during a flare-up. Let’s come up with a plan that supports both your health and safety.”


<br>When a family member is resistant to safely storing medications at home:

<br>“While it is true your child could get pills from a store, most suicide attempts occur at home with little or no preparation. Let’s talk about a plan that addresses your concerns and also ensures your daughter cannot take enough pills to harm herself.”






<br><br><br>
<br>Conversations about reducing access to lethal means are not always straightforward or easy. This can be especially true when discussing firearms. As a clinician, if you own guns you may feel more at ease raising the topic and more knowledgeable about storage options. If you aren’t a gun owner, it’s possible you might feel uneasy broaching the topic or overestimate client resistance. However, most gun owners value firearm safety and protecting their family—values that dovetail well with preventing suicide.

<br>When firearms are a family tradition and bonding experience:

<br>Consider alternatives
<br>Discuss safety
<br>Store guns elsewhere


<br>When guns provide safety and protection:

<br>Weigh concerns:

<br>Weigh the safety concerns of suicidality versus the concern of temporarily not having a firearm at home. 




<br>Consider other options:

<br>Consider other things that could help keep the family safe such as pepper spray, alarms, or outdoor motion-detector lighting. 


<br>Prioritize client's health:

<br>Underscore that part of protecting the client's family is ensuring the client is alive and well. 
<br>Discuss behavioral history:

<br>Ask about any history of impulsive or unexpected behavior, and build on that to reinforce your concern. 




<br>When guns provide security due to PTSD:

<br>Ask how client feels:

<br>Ask if the client trusts themselves with a loaded gun close at hand. 




<br>Consider behavioral strategies:

<br>Use a behavioral intervention (e.g. behavioral modification, behavior shaping, rehearsal) or other interventions that focus on taking small steps to reduce access and gradually increasing these steps. 




<br><br>
<br>Talking to Parents/Guardians:

<br>When working with a person under age 18 who is at risk for suicide, involve parents or guardians. Let them know that you are concerned about a possible suicide attempt and explain that reducing access to lethal means can reduce the likelihood of a suicide death.
<br>When the youth has expressed suicidal ideation:

<br>“The fact that your child has had suicidal thoughts means we need to take the risk of suicide seriously. We’ve talked about getting him into treatment. I’d also like to talk about steps you can take at home to help keep him safe.”
<br>"If a child or teenager attempts suicide, it’s usually at home and it’s often a quick decision. Putting time and distance between them and a method that could do serious harm is one of the single most effective steps to protect your child."


<br>When the youth is not currently suicidal but at risk:

<br>“I’ve asked her about suicidal thoughts, and she hasn’t disclosed any. Suicide is still a concern when kids are struggling. These thoughts can develop rapidly, often without warning, and can prompt an unplanned suicide attempt. Therefore, we routinely suggest a few important steps you can take at home.”
<br>"With everything going on in your home right now and the impact on your child, it is best to make the environment in your home safer in case a suicidal crisis occurs unexpectedly. It is safest to temporarily remove all firearms from the home and to reduce access to medications, particularly those for pain and other drugs of abuse, while your child is at risk."




<br><br>
<br>Since firearms are the leading cause of suicide deaths, be sure to talk with the youth and their parents/guardians about guns in the home. 
<br>Gather information from youth:

<br>Talk to your young clients about whether there are guns in the home and find out if they have access to them.&nbsp;For example, some clinicians ask youth, “How long would it take you to get access to guns in your home?”
<br>Talk to the parents about gun access and storage:
<br>Speak to the adult in the household who is the primary gun owner (unless there are contraindications such as spouse abuse).&nbsp;

<br>Find out the following:

<br>How are the guns stored in the home? Since gun owners often have more than one, gather information about all of them.
<br>Does their child have access to any of the guns in the home? Many parents underestimate their children’s knowledge about where guns are stored and how to access them (e.g., key or combination).&nbsp;
<br>Are there other homes where the youth stays that may have guns? Discuss all possibilities, such as joint custody situations, relatives, hunting buddies, or other friends.
<br>Make sure the youth cannot hear your discussion (even if it is by phone), especially if there’s a chance the child is unaware of household firearms.

<br>Explain the focus on firearms, if necessary:

<br>If parents ask why you are focusing on firearms, explain that they are the most lethal method of suicide and that unlike nearly every other method, there’s no opportunity for the person to change their mind or be rescued mid-attempt. Since suicidal feelings are often short-lived and can come on unpredictably, putting time and distance between an at-risk youth and firearms is an effective way to protect them.










<br><br>
<br>Lethal means counseling is client-oriented. 
<br>When discussing lethal means with clients or family members, make it a collaborative conversation. 
<br>Your approach and the language you use matters. A collaborative, guiding approach is usually best. A more directive approach is less collaborative but may be more appropriate with certain clients. 
<br>When working with a young person at risk for suicide, always involve parents or guardians. 
<br><br>
<br>Together with your client, collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means. Depending on the client’s situation, this plan usually covers firearms and medications, as well as any other methods that are the focus of your client’s ideation.
<br>The plan should include the following:

<br>Clear roles and tasks:

<br>Who will do what (this is especially important to do if others are involved)


<br>A timetable:

<br>When each part of the plan will be done




<br><br><br>
<br>Family members may not be aware that suicide attempts usually occur with little or no planning and that the method a person chooses often depends on its availability. It can be helpful to inform family members or significant others and to enlist their support in reducing access to lethal means, for example, if there are medications which the client must access daily or occasionally.
<br><br>
<br>
Benefits:

<br>Involving family can be very effective. In fact, families counseled to remove or secure lethal means are far more likely to do so than those who are not counseled. Additionally, results of a pilot study indicate the majority of families reported that the counseling they received was respectful of their needs.


<br>
Considerations:

<br>Some clients will not want you to enlist the help of their family members. In these situations, close friends or peer mentors may be more acceptable and less risky to involve than family members. Collaborate with your client on who would be best to engage.<br>
- Permission:<br>
- Ask your client for permission to talk with others before doing so (e.g., spouse, romantic partner, parents, friends, or peer mentors). For minors (under age 18), you may talk to the parents or legal guardian without the client’s permission. To help maintain your relationship with a minor, however, be sure to inform your client before speaking with a parent or guardian.<br>
- Permission Denied:<br>
- If a client does not give you permission to talk with anyone, yet you believe that removal of a lethal means is necessary for the safety of that individual, this could be considered permissible communication. Consult the current HIPAA guidelines for situations like this.<br>
- Remember, in order to collaborate effectively with a client (or their parents), the clinician should:<br>
- Use language that indicates acceptance of gun ownership without judgement.<br>
- Focus on the (hopefully) temporary nature of both the mental health crisis and the need to reduce access to lethal means.<br>
- Be sensitive to all types of cultural differences, recognizing that gun owners tend to prefer language that emphasizes options and autonomy. 

<br>Consider the Client's Reaction:

<br>Before finalizing a plan to reduce access to firearms, or any suicide method, consider your client's reactions to it and the likelihood of follow-through with the plan. If you are working with the parents or guardians of youth, take their reactions into consideration. The client’s (or parents’) response may reveal whether the plan is likely to be carried out.

<br>Examples:

<br>Initial reluctance from client:

<br>Is your client initially reluctant to implement the plan and then relieved when they agree? This may indicate strong commitment to that particular method and a positive indication that, for now at least, they are electing to live.


<br>Readily agreeable client:

<br>If your client readily agrees to give up access to means and puts up no resistance, you may need to be a little suspicious. Sometimes lack of resistance means that the person is already considering a substitute method or holding something back.  

<br>For example, the client may be thinking, “Okay, now that I don’t have guns, I’ll just use pills.” If you have doubts, say something like, “Thank you for your help on this. Now I’m wondering what other means you’ve considered and if those means are available to you.”




<br>Mixed messages from family members:

<br>If you are working with family members and one member is agreeable but the gun-owning family member seems reluctant, this may indicate a lack of commitment by the gun owner to follow through with the plan.










<br>Monitor Progress:

<br>Document and Monitor:

<br>Once you've arrived at a mutually acceptable plan for reducing access to lethal means, document it in your notes. 

<br>Access to lethal means:

<br>For all persons identified at risk for suicide, indicate that you have assessed for specific access to lethal means.


<br>Recommendations and Steps:

<br>List any recommendations and steps agreed upon with the client to reduce access to lethal means and make the environment safer.


<br>Contact with Others:

<br>Indicate if you contacted family members or a support person to confirm the removal or securing of lethal means. If the client or family has engaged law enforcement, a pharmacy, or others to hold or dispose of lethal means, this should be documented in the medical records.




<br>One way to ensure that lethal means counseling becomes a standard component of working with people at risk of suicide is, where possible, to build prompts into electronic templates and paper forms that serve as a reminder. For example, systems that use electronic medical records can embed specific lethal means documentation into templates for intake assessments, crisis appointments, therapy or medication appointments, and many other appointment types.


<br>Recommendations for Follow-Up:

<br>Never assume that the agreed-on plan will go as intended. Follow-up is essential. 
<br>Suggestions for monitoring progress:

<br>Make follow-up calls

<br>Call to check on progress and assess how the client is doing. Or ask the client or family member to contact you when they've carried out the tasks in the plan. 


<br>Continue to assess suicide risk:

<br>Assess and monitor your client's risk of suicide on an ongoing basis. Things can improve or deteriorate rapidly. Return to discussions of means reduction as needed. 


<br>Adapt plan

<br>Make any necessary changes to the plan if the client's situation changes. For instance, if a client moves out of their current home and in with a friend, the plan would need to be updated for the new living situation, and the friend would need to be collaboratively engaged in the plan. 


<br>Encourage close supervision

<br>Encourage family, relatives, and friends to provide closer supervision since clients may struggle with their moods or have episodes of suicidal thoughts interspersed with stretches of feeling okay. 








<br>Key Points:

<br>Collaborate on a plan to reduce access to lethal means and enlist the support of family and friends. 
<br>Agree on roles and timetable.
<br>Document the plan in your notes and monitor progress. 
<br>Continue to monitor the client's suicide risk as treatment continues. 
<br>Update the plan to reduce means, as needed.

<br>Identity and apply trauma-informed strategies for deescalating crisis situations and working with people who are emotionally distressed. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>An event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects.

<br><br>
<br>Exposure to multiple traumatic events from an early age.
<br>The immediate and long-term effects of these experiences over development.
<br><br>
<br>"The cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations, including the lifespan, which emanates from massive group trauma." (Braveheart)
<br>Examples:

<br>American Indian and Alaskan Native communities
<br>Communities of color
<br>Holocaust survivors
<br>Japanese-American survivors of internment camps
<br>LGBTQ communities


<br><br>
<br>Potentially traumatic experiences resulting from:

<br>Direct experiences of racial harassment
<br>Witnessing racial violence toward others
<br>Experiencing discrimination and institutional racism


<br><br><br>
<br>A single traumatic event that is limited in time
<br><br>
<br>Experiencing multiple traumatic events
<br><br>
<br>Exposure to chronic trauma which impacts the child's development

<br>Usually caused by adults entrusted with the child's care


<br><br><br>
<br>NORMAL response/reaction to stress and even trauma (4-6 weeks)
<br><br>
<br>Exaggerated and prolonged stress response beyond 4-6 weeks and even years later

<br>Dysregulation of stress chemistry - stress hormone levels don't decrease
<br>Increased activation of Sympathetic Nervous System (heart rate, startle response, fight response)


<br><br>
<br>70% of adults in the US have experienced some types of traumatic event at least once in their lives. 

<br>223.4 million people


<br>In public behavioral health, over 90% of clients have experienced trauma.
<br>Trauma is a risk factor in nearly all behavioral health and substance use disorders. 
<br><br>
<br>Collaboration between the CDC and Kaiser Permanente study of over 17,000 adult patients in health maintenance organizations (1995-1997); 2 waves of data collection
<br>Gathers information about health history and exposure to the following events prior to age 18:

<br>Recurrent physical abuse
<br>Recurrent emotional abuse
<br>Sexual abuse
<br>An alcohol or drug abuser
<br>An incarcerated household member
<br>Someone who is chronically depressed, suicidal, institutionalized or mentally ill
<br>Mother being treated violently
<br>One or no parents
<br>Emotional or physical neglect


<br>“How ACEs influence health and wellbeing through lifespan.png” could not be found.
<br><br>
<br>Nearly two-thirds Ohioans have been exposed to ACEs
<br>Ohioans more likely to experience multiple ACEs:

<br>People of color
<br>People with low-income
<br>People with a disability
<br>Residents of urban and Appalachian counties


<br><br>
<br>Stress:

<br>Unpredictable, Severe, Prolonged -&gt; Vulnerability
<br>Predictable, Moderate, Controlled -&gt; Resilience


<br><br>
<br>Natural response to the prolonged uncertainty and disruption caused by a pandemic

<br>Lack of motivation
<br>Stress over tasks that would generally be managed well
<br>Changes in eating or sleeping habits
<br>Irritability
<br>Feelings of hopelessness
<br>Difficulty concentrating


<br><br>
<br>At any given point in time, we have a limited supply of 'adaptive energy'
<br>In the best of conditions, this reservoir is quite high and will allow us to meet unusual challenges
<br>Chronic and prolonged stress related to COVID-19 and other stressors has depleted the reservoir of adaptive energy, making us all more vulnerable to stress. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The amygdala senses threat and sets off the alarm. 
<br>Thinking brain assess the situation. 
<br>Thinking brain goes offline. Emotional brain activates fight or flight response. 
<br>Thinking brain helps shut off the alarm and helps us to calm down. 
<br><br>
<br>An experience becomes traumatic when it overwhelms our system for responding to stress. 
<br>The emotional brain continues to sound the alarm and send messages to fight or flee, even after the threat has passed. 
<br><br>
<br>Autonomic Nervous System:

<br>Direct role in physical response to stress. 

<br>Sympathetic Nervous System:

<br>'Fight or flight' response
<br>Body shifts energy resources toward fighting off or fleeing a threat
<br>Signals release of adrenaline and cortisol
<br>Heart beats faster, respiration rate increases, blood vessels in arms and legs dilate, digestive process changes, glucose levels in blood (sugar energy) increase


<br>Parasympathetic Nervous System:

<br>Facilitates recovery once acute stressor is over
<br>Over-activity can contribute to stress reactions






<br>Chronic stress can result in a long-term drain on the body

<br>Wear and tear
<br>Continuous activation of the nervous system can be problematic in all systems. 


<br><br>
<br>Musculoskeletal System:

<br>Muscles in body are in constant state of guardedness

<br>Muscle tension, headaches, migraines, back pain




<br>Respiratory System

<br>Shortness of breath
<br>Rapid breathing


<br>Cardiovascular System

<br>Elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, elevated stress hormones, inflammation


<br>Endocrine System

<br>Increased production of cortisol


<br>Gastrointestinal System

<br>Changes in gut bacteria, pain, bloating, discomfort


<br>Esophagus

<br>Eat more or less than usual, increased use of substances, heartburn/acid reflux


<br><br><br>
<br>History of previous exposure to trauma
<br>Age of exposure 
<br>Gender
<br>Cognitive ability
<br>Self-efficacy
<br>Biological factors (e.g. flexibility in thinking, emotional regulation)
<br><br>
<br>Nature of the traumatic event
<br>Proximity to the traumatic event
<br>Culture and ethnicity
<br>Level of social support
<br>Quality of parent-child relationships, parent mental health, and parental history of trauma
<br>Health of the broader community
<br><br>
<br>Positive:

<br>Resilience

<br>A positive, adaptive response to significant adversity. 

<br>Adaptable, caring, and supportive relationship with an adult. 
<br>A sense of mastery over life circumstances. 
<br>Strong executive function and self-regulation skills.
<br>Affirming faith or cultural traditions


<br>Individuals may demonstrate resilience in one type of situation but not another. 
<br>Coping skills that support resilience can be developed at any age. 
<br>Children do not develop the capacity to positive adapt to adversity in isolation. 
<br>Regardless of resources, individuals who face extreme adversity are likely to be significantly impacted. 
<br>We all play an important role in fostering resilience. 


<br>Recovery
<br>Post-traumatic growth


<br>Negative:

<br>Severe persisting distress
<br>Decline
<br>Stable maladaptive functioning


<br>We need to presume the clients we serve have a history of traumatic stress and exercise “universal precautions” by creating systems of care that are trauma-informed.
<br><br>
<br>Understanding trauma and its impact
<br>Promoting safety
<br>Ensuring cultural competence
<br>Supporting control, choice, autonomy
<br>Collaboration and mutuality
<br>Integrating care
<br>Healing happens in relationships
<br>Recovery is possible
<br><br><br>
<br>Bringing a volatile and potentially explosive situation to a peaceful, calm resolution by verbal means... and no one getting hurt.

<br>Monitor and manage your own stress level
<br><br><br>
<br>Clients in crisis require structure and boundaries to help re-establish stability
<br>Engaging client in discussion (repeated concerns can inadvertently contribute to chaos and triangulation; following the identified plan is the best way to support and care for these clients)
<br>Parallel Process:

<br>Don't get pulled into the chaos

<br><br>
<br>Stage 1: Anxiety/Agitation
<br>Stage 2: Argumentative/Defensive
<br>Stage 3: Verbally, Physically Threatening
<br>Stage 4: Assaultive
<br><br>
<br>The more threatened the individual, the more 'primitive' (or regressed) becomes the style of thinking and behaving. 
<br>When a traumatized person is in a state of alarm:

<br>They will be less capable of concentrating
<br>They will be more anxious

<br>Feeling vulnerable
<br>Feeling rejected
<br>Confrontation
<br>Loneliness
<br>Sensory overload
<br>Intimacy (safety, love, security, family)
<br>Peace, calm, quiet


<br>'Re-Experiencing' can lead to out-of-control behavior

<br>When someone with a trauma history begins to escalate, it may be because they are remembering or re-experiencing a traumatic event
<br>They may be reminded of the trauma and be flooded or overwhelmed with memories of that earlier traumatic event. 


<br><br>
<br>Remember your superpowers:

<br>Body language

<br>Facial expression
<br>Posture
<br>Position


<br>Tone of voice
<br>Active listening


<br>Calm and caring attitude
<br>Ask for help
<br><br>
<br>Someone who is escalated is under stress and not likely to think clearly
<br>Your perception of your ability to cope with the situation is going to impact your own stress level when managing these interactions
<br>De-escalation skills start with self-awareness.

<br>Understanding how stress affects how you act, think, and communicate


<br><br>
<br>Speak in a calm, slow, warm, clear voice
<br>Show that you care
<br>Be aware of your non-verbal communication
<br>Acknowledge feelings
<br>Maintain eye contact (but don't stare)
<br>You may need to repeat yourself; the client may be distracted
<br>Be patient; give the situation time; time is on your side
<br>Remain a friendly tone and join with the client

<br>Helps the client see that you and the client are a team
<br>"We are going to figure this out"


<br>Allow the client to vent ("Tell me more about that")
<br>Use 'Please' and 'thank you' often
<br>Accept the client's feelings, thoughts and behaviors without judgement

<br>Remember that most of us have been irrational and said inappropriate things when we are under extreme stress


<br>Effective communication often depends as much on how you say the words you choose as much as the words themselves
<br>Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings
<br>Alert others, if needed
<br>Evaluate each situation for violence
<br>Keep an open path
<br>Remove yourself/others if situation is getting out of control
<br><br>
<br>Open up clear lines of communication
<br>Build trust and validate the client's situation (even if you don't agree)
<br>Get the client talking about concerns as a route to calming
<br>Gather the necessary information to make a good resolution
<br><br>
<br>If a client is escalated, they feel out of control which tells us that their normal coping measures are not working
<br>Keep your focus. You are trying to give the client a sense that they are in control. 

<br>When someone feels out of control, they are more likely to escalate


<br>Your ability to engage a client in conversation successfully can resolve the conflict
<br>If it seems you may not get there, ask for help
<br><br>
<br>Shows interest
<br>Close-ended questions may be necessary but client is more likely to tell you what you want to hear
<br>"What can I help you with today?" vs. "Do you want to schedule an appointment?"
<br>"What time of day works best for you?" vs. "Can you come at 2 pm?"
<br>"Can you tell me..."
<br><br>
<br>Being expressively/explicitly kind
<br>Builds rapport and nurtures competence

<br>"I appreciate you telling me what's wrong."
<br>"It took a lot of courage for you to reach out today."
<br>"You've done a great job of keeping your appointments in the past. We really appreciate that."


<br><br>
<br>Validates and shows you’ve heard the client
<br>Mirror back what you’re hearing is going on • Allow further explanation of the concern by not inserting your opinion
<br>Listen for feelings, themes, motivations, unmet need

<br>“It sounds like you’ve had a really tough time.”
<br>“You’re really angry about what’s happened.” 
<br>“You’re ____.”

<br>Insert any emotion—“mad,” “upset,” “frustrated,” “worried,” etc. You can’t do it wrong!


<br>“Sounds like…”
<br>“Seems like…”
<br>“It feels like…”
<br>“To you, it looks like…”
<br>“I am hearing…”
<br>“I am wondering if…”


<br><br>
<br>Help transition the client to resolution:

<br>“So you’ve been through a lot and you’re really upset about everything that’s happened before. It sounds like we need to get you in to talk to someone. Would it be okay to get you scheduled for an appointment?”
<br>“The last time you were here, you thought you got the run around and didn’t have time to see the provider. You were really frustrated by all that. How about if we get you scheduled again and see if we can get things resolved?”


<br><br>
<br>Remember the overall goal - client care
<br>If you take a LESS authoritative, LESS controlling, LESS confrontational approach, you actually will have MORE control in the situation. 
<br><br>
<br>Responding angrily
<br>Not listening
<br>Criticizing
<br>Being defensive
<br>Arguing with the client
<br>Engaging in power struggles
<br>Ordering the client what to do 
<br>Threatening (to cancel an appointment, etc.)
<br>Minimizing the importance of the client's concern
<br>Moving quickly (can be perceived as aggressive)
<br><br>
<br>Saying "You need to calm down"
<br>Trying to be right
<br>Giving commands

<br>"lower your voice"


<br>Arguing with the client
<br>Taking the words or actions of the client personally (even if the client tries to make it personal)
<br>Minimizing the situation ("It is not that bad")
<br>Asking a lot of questions
<br>Asking 'Why' questions
<br>Forcing discussion
<br><br>
<br>Do not express anger, impatience, or irritation

<br>Breathe
<br>Take a moment away, if possible


<br>Never use inflammatory language ("You are acting crazy")
<br>Notice if you are feeling as though you have to rush or feeling like you are stuck if it takes time to get to work through the client interaction

<br>Breathe through it, be patient
<br>Request help, if needed


<br>Don't intervene too quickly or try too hard to control the interaction by interrupting or talking over the client
<br><br>
<br>Follow agency policy

<br>Document


<br>Debrief

<br>Strategies to manage/avoid similar situations in future

<br>What went well? What didn't go well?
<br>Did anything contribute to the escalation?
<br>Did anything help diffuse the situation?


<br>Support for staff, clients, and individuals involved


<br><br>
<br>People are coping the best way they can - our job is to help them find a better way
<br>Requires building trust, creating safety, and creating a trauma informed culture that provides a safe and healing environment
<br>Healing takes more than therapy

<br>Support services can create therapeutic, healing experiences - a place of safety


<br><br>
<br>Screen for trauma history
<br>Deepen attunement skills - learn to interpret behavior effectively as communication
<br>Employ person-centered, strengths-based thinking and language
<br>Provide stability and empowerment
<br>Consider the physiological, psychological, and social risks of physical interventions - choose the least restrictive option as a last resort if somebody is a danger to themselves or others
<br>Prioritize debriefing after a crisis to help foster resilience and develop successful coping skills
<br><br>
<br>Be empathetic and non-judgemental
<br>Respect personal space
<br>Use non-threatening non-verbals
<br>Avoid overreacting
<br>Focus on feelings
<br>Ignore challenging questions
<br>Set limits
<br>Choose wisely what you insist upon
<br>Allow silence for reflection
<br>Allow time for decisions

 <br>
<br>Why are couples behaving so badly?

<br>"The average couple waits 6 years before seeking out therapy." (Gottman)

<br>In those 6 years there is:

<br>Build up of resentments
<br>Reinforced bad habits
<br>No boundary enforcement
<br>Erosion of positive perspective
<br>Unconscious bias kicks - assumptions about purposeful poor behavior choices
<br>Missed bids for attention
<br>Depletion of emotional bank account
<br>Never had any positive role models to begin with




<br>From a survey conducted in September 2020:

<br>Increases in substance misuse:

<br>Alcohol (88%)
<br>Marijuana (37%)
<br>Prescription Opioids (15%)


<br>Domestic violence cases increased by 25%-33% globally. 




<br>How are these influences showing up in the clients in the therapy room?

<br>Passive/aggressive behaviors
<br>Shut down/Withdrawn/Stonewalling
<br>Withholding Sex or Avoiding Intimacy
<br>Narcissistic Behavior Responses
<br>Gaslighting
<br>Anger
<br>High Conflict
<br>Boundary Crossing
<br>Persistent and Ongoing Flooding
<br>Unwilling to Repair/Apologize/Take Responsibility


<br><br>
<br>How to prepare yourself for the unexpected:

<br>When you open your office door, look for body language and non-verbals. 
<br>Have confidence and KNOW that you are the expert in the room. Own it and be brave.


<br><br>
<br>Set the tone at the beginning of the session when you feel something is off. 
<br>Let the clients know what you feel when you feel it, and be willing to talk about what is happening. (Do not wait for clients to bring it up or ignore it)
<br>Model for your couples that you are going to talk about it, not let things be passive-aggressive or avoid dealing with hot topics. 
<br>Remind clients who escalate that they are not in therapy to repeat old patterns. 
<br>Pause and interrupt when you see unacknowledged emotion happening in the room. That is your job. 
<br><br>
<br>Don't let your couples argue or verbally explode on each other. They can do that at home for free. 
<br>Take Control. 

<br>Develop your phrase to create stop-action with clients. Say things like, 'pause, stop,' or call out your client's name, etc. 


<br>Be direct.

<br>What is acceptable and what is not acceptable about words or behavior in the room. What you would like your clients to do instead (as for their positive need). 
<br>Why it's not okay for them to say or do the thing that you witnessed in the room. 
<br>Let the clients know how painful it is for you to witness, so you can't imagine what it's like for their partner. 


<br><br>
<br>Keep your eyes on each client in the room. Are you letting one partner high jack the session? Stop the speaking partner and ask, 'What's coming up for you?' Notice if the other partner checks in. 
<br>Be mindful of the need to stop and tend to the party not speaking. This is how you keep explosions from getting out of control because you have been checking in on what is happening on the other side of the couch. 
<br>Step in for clients when they don't have words and find a way to speak their pain to their partner. 
<br>Keep it fair, so both partners feel you are connected with their pain, needs, and wanted outcomes. 
<br><br>
<br>Normalize high emotion and disappointment of partner not being able to acknowledge perspectives not because they don't love you. Differences on family of origin, difference in expectations, etc. 
<br>Prior traumas and life experiences make it hard for partners to always regulate their emotions in ways they would hope. 
<br>Untreated mental health issues impact ability to manage emotions. 
<br>Not finished working on the 'Me' stuff versus the 'We' stuff and bleeding over into our relationship. 
<br>Discuss the impact of substances and the impact it has on being able to manage emotions. 
<br>Gottman Method:

<br>Flooding is expected because partners are experiencing physiological arousal. Utilize pulse oximeters to help validate their elevated heart rate. 


<br><br>
<br>Be okay with breaking it up. 

<br>Sometimes you need to have one couple leave the room while you do some one-on-one with the other partner. 
<br>Let an explosive partner leave if they want. Don't chase them or try to convince them to stay or come back. 
<br>Talk about the flooding in the room and share ways to help self-regulate, like taking deep breaths or pausing to find ways to reframe. 


<br><br>
<br>You need to be prepared when working with couples that you might need to a break from couples therapy or stop all together based on how the clients present. 
<br>This is your call as a therapist to evaluate if working with the couple is contraindicated because of co-occurring mental health, substance, unresolved trauma, suicidal ideation, personality disorders, characterological DV, or anger management issues. 
<br>Often necessary to request that clients seek out individual therapy to strengthen their individual coping skills before attempting additional couples' therapy. 
<br>Expect your clients to disagree and give you pushback. Attitude is everything in this conversation. Remember, your clients are not your peers, and we often have to make unpopular decisions about the course of care. 
<br><br>
<br>When you feel anxious and flooded as the therapist:

<br>Notice where you are breathing. 
<br>Plant both feet on the floor. Take your shoulders back against your chair, take a deep breath into your belly, and repeat to yourself:

<br>"This is not my pain to feel."




<br><br>
<br>Get in touch with your client's inner 5-year-old old in the room. What is hurting them, and what is the catastrophe scenario that is playing out for them?
<br>When I de-escalate, so do my clients. When my voice gets softer and quieter, so does my clients, and they can often match my tone and calm demeanor. 
<br>Don't shy away from acknowledging they have the right to feel upset, and it makes sense they would be even if their partner does not agree. 
<br>Ask their partner to find something they said that they can validate for their partner. Remind them this is not the same as agreeing. 
<br>Focus on the behavior or the words you heard. 

<br>We can help facilitate meaningful conversation about the emotions each partner is feeling. 
<br>Ask the partner who is feeling a big emotion related to their partner to name their emotion. Then talk the behavior they say their partner do or the words they heard them say. 
<br>Remind and monitor clients to avoid telling their partner their evaluation of why their partner did it or the mind set they were in when it happened. This often happens and only creates defensiveness in their partner. No one likes to be told how they feel. 
<br>Ask for your positive need. Even if the answer is no - you need to hear yourself asking for your need. 


<br><br>
<br>Gottman Method Stress Reducing Conversation

<br>10-minutes each partner. Listening for understanding and share emotion. (Not problem-solving)
<br>How do clients know it's working? Does your partner feel hear and understood? Then yes. 
<br>Use of open-ended questions to help partners attune, connect, and provide empathy and support. 


<br>Questions that allow for each partner to draw out their partner's experience, such as:

<br>"What is this like for you? What do you need? What don't you like about this situation?"


<br>Gottman Method Dreams within Conflict

<br>Asks clients to suspend problem-solving so they can have a better understanding of the childhood stories, values, or core ethics and beliefs that keep their partner rooted in their perspective. 
<br>Clients take turns asking each partner a set of questions so they can better experience what it's like to walk in their partner's shoes. 
<br>Preparation for compromise like partners who love each other. 


<br>Gottman Method Injuries Exercise

<br>Helps partners find a structured and safe format to talk about old injuries in a way that helps facilitate compassion, acceptance, and understand about prior and shared traumas.
<br>Creates awareness and insight about the impact and ways these traumas have shaped the way each partner views their world.
<br>Helps evaluate how clients have learned to cope and survive. Can help some clients gain insight on how they behave in relationships in ways that no longer serve them.
<br>Helps couples therapist normalize and make recommendations of ways those old injuries get triggered in the relationship and behavior changes that might be beneficial.


<br>Gottman Method Appreciations Exercise

<br>Changes tone and energy in session.
<br>Allows each partner to find something positive to notice about their partner to demonstrate holding each other from a positive perspective.
<br>Makes deposits into each partner’s emotional bank account.
<br>Starts conversations about how to do small things often in the relationship for highly disconnected couples.
<br>Way to end session, so couples can ground before leaving in turmoil.


<br><br>
<br>If apologies are made, they are often expressed as implying you misunderstood something but without remorse for poor behaviors
<br>Outside behaviors or the other person is ALWAYS the source of conflict or turn it around on the other person implying they are really the culprit for the issue
<br>Self-doubt creeps in and the partner being gaslit internalizes their lack of hard work in the relationship as the cause of all the problems.
<br>Guilt develops about bringing up issues in the relationship.
<br>It feels very much like the result of narcissistic behavior responses.
<br>The partner who is doing the gaslighting may do so unconsciously to gain control or power in the relationship when they feel out of resources or support.
<br>Manipulation that involves making someone question their own reality, feelings, and experiences of events, in order to maintain CONTROL over that person.
<br><br>
<br>Deflecting the other person by use of lack of acknowledgement, negative body language, and minimizing statements about the other person’s perspective or feelings. 
<br>Unwillingness to accept any part of the responsibility for a misunderstanding or conflict. 
<br>Intentional implication that the other person is over-reacting or has fabricated a situation in order to create doubt or challenge the other person’s reality 
<br>Being cut off from making points, asking questions, or providing input during a disagreement. 
<br>No acknowledgment of your hurt feelings when expressed. Lacks Empathy.
<br>Clients are often overly invested in using narcissist label with each other. 

<br>Only 5% of population are diagnosable with narcissistic personality disorder
<br>You should be aware that most clients who have diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder are not going to be served in couples therapy and may be contra-indicated. 


<br><br>
<br>Gottman Interventions to Bring into Session

<br>Introduces the idea that anything our partner does for us is a gift - they are not required to do so because we are in a relationship with each other.
<br>Softened Start Up:

<br>This is helpful for the narcissistic leaning partner to learn how to be clear in their needs and learn how to share why it is important to them. This helps them to slowly understand they are not entitled to anything. 


<br>Appreciations:

<br>Help the narcissistic partner to think about what the other person adds to their life and to acknowledge it.


<br>Accept the things you can't change. 

<br>Helpful for both partners to understand there are some things that are unlikely to ever completely be different in their dynamics. Helps partners make a choice about the relationship from that space of acceptance.


<br>Aftermath of a Regrettable Incident:

<br>Introduction to Narcissistic person about their role in feeling disrespected or unappreciated. 


<br>Active listening exercises like the Gottman-Rapport


<br><br>
<br>You must interrupt patterns of rage, repeated interruptions, storming off, or screaming. 
<br>Be on the lookout for a partner who has NPD to be overly charming or makes big declarations of victimhood, or says their only goal is “to fight for the relationship.” 
<br>Avoid becoming a victim of triangulation or becoming caught up in buying into the hope that you can fix the narcissistic behaviors. 
<br>You MUST be comfortable being direct, holding a strong position of authority in the room, and be willing to call out poor behavior that is impacting the relationship. 
<br>Strongly suggest and sometimes require that both partners be in individual therapy and check in with this therapist to make sure they are aware of the dynamics happening in the relationship. 
<br>The only goal you may accomplish is validating the victim that they are correct in their reality and that they can trust their intuition. You may serve as the objective voice this person needs to get clear and end the relationship. 
<br>Don’t fight, argue, or try to overpower the narcissist.
<br>There is a very strong likelihood that despite your support that these sessions may not go as you hope! 
<br>Many clients who have narcissistic behaviors can and will use the tools they learn in session to abuse, further manipulate, or weaponize against their partner. 
<br>True NPD will NOT be ok with the change in or loss of power and will retaliate. 
<br>Evaluate if the partner is becoming more agitated, aggressive, and if you suspect there is an increased likelihood for physical abuse-stop sessions. 
<br>Recognize you can and potentially should take a break from therapy with the couples. 
<br>Should you refer them to seek individual therapy for a while and then re-evaluate if they are good candidates for couples therapy? 
<br>Couples therapy can re-traumatize the partner who is being victimized. 
<br>Consider if this is in the scope of your practice? Do you need to refer out?
<br><br>
<br>Make time before letting clients go to let them know that it was a hard session and how important it was to have it. 
<br>Let your partner know that if they are flooded when they will come back and talk about it with you. Make a date with each other to come back and process. 
<br>Check in with each partner about what they will do to self-soothe. 
<br>Remind clients that emotions and feeling hurt or misunderstood happens in relationships. The couple is not in this situation because they don’t love each other but because the stakes are so high. This is your person and if we are not ok then nothing feels ok. 
<br>Let them know you are proud of them for doing the work.

 <br>
<br>Results consist of two scores for the two separate factors; Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. The minimum score for each scale is 7 and a maximum score of 42. In addition, scores are represented in terms of percentile ranks compared to a normative sample. A percentile of 50 represents typical (and healthy) attachment, whereas higher percentiles represent more difficulties with adult attachment compared to peers.
<br>Attachment avoidance is defined as involving fear of dependence and interpersonal intimacy, an excessive need for self-reliance, and reluctance to self-disclose.
<br>Attachment anxiety is defined as involving a fear of interpersonal rejection or abandonment, an excessive need for approval from others, and distress when one’s partner is unavailable or unresponsive.
<br>People who score high on either or both of these dimensions are assumed to have an insecure adult attachment orientation. By contrast, people with low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance can be viewed as having a secure adult attachment orientation (Brennan et al., 1998). In addition, higher scores are significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, interpersonal distress, or loneliness.

 <br><br>
<br>Before each session co-therapists should have a pre-session meeting. Therapists pre-session so that co-therapists are on the same page. During pre-sessioning you should decide on the following:

<br>The intention or goals for the session
<br>Agreement on a theoretical model
<br>Create a session specific game plan
<br>Discuss previous sessions, hypotheses, and evaluation of progress
<br>Make decisions about next steps in treatment


<br>You should also consider the following questions amongst yourself:

<br>What would blow you out of the water?
<br>What would be so shocking that you wouldn't know what to do?
<br>Let's brainstorm what we would do if XYZ occurred in session

<br>Examples (arguing, escalation, high conflict, desire to end relationship, risk, etc.)


<br>How would you manage that?
<br>What do you anticipate?
<br>What is your theory of what's going on--your theory of the problem?


<br>Strategies for the therapy room

<br>As a co-therapy team you should determine which strategies you are going to use in the room. What is the role of each therapist and how will you work together.


<br>Some strategies to consider:

<br>Tag team

<br>One starts speaking, while the other would be writing questions, and perhaps nodding occasionally, or making validating and summarizing statements.
<br>Then, when number one (i.e. the one who was speaking) runs out number two is ready. They're ready, because they've been writing questions, and they can jump in with those questions.


<br>Preparation and sharing airtime

<br>Who will do what in the session? Who is handling assessment or genogram?
<br>Will we ever spend time one on one or break up subsystems of the client system?
<br>Split the joining tasks
<br>Before you go into the room, you decide which member of the couple each therapist will focus on with joining.

<br>For example:

<br>You're going to join with the husband, and I'm going to join with the wife.
<br>It's very specific who we're each validating, empathizing, and summarizing. If you start asking questions of the husband, it's my job to ask the follow-up questions of the wife. In the same vein with the wife, so that we're like two advocates.






<br>Reflecting Team

<br>As co-therapists there may be times when you find it appropriate to turn to one another and talk about what is going on or what you notice in the room. This could be used as an intervention or to help determine the next steps in the session.
<br>Example:

<br>Co-therapists turn to one another and debate or argue about what is happening with the client system. Have a discussion or debate about what is going on, and then turn back to the couple and say, "Where are we going wrong?, or "How are we getting it right?"

 <br><br><br>
<br>Questions for both:

<br>What happened to your marriage that's gotten you to the point where divorce is a possibility?
<br>Can you tell me what you have done to try to fix the problems in the marriage, whether on your own or with help?
<br>What role, if any, do your children play in your decision making about the future of your relationship?
<br>Can you tell me about a time in your relationship, since the time you met, when you felt the most connection and joy?


<br>Questions for Leaning-Out partner (see this person first):

<br>Tell me more about your pain and reasons for considering divorce. 
<br>(Within no more than 10 minutes) switch to a conversation about the paths. 
<br>Find out how far they have gone in formalizing divorce plans (contacted attorney, papers drawn up, etc.)
<br>Ask them their perspective on their contributions to the problems in the marriage. 
<br>Prepare a summary statement for the other partner about something they have taken away from the individual time, then invite partner 2 in the room to hear the summary statement.  


<br>Now work with the leaning-in partner:

<br>Help them articulate that they understand their partner's concerns and can understand why their partner might be interested in divorce. 
<br>Ask about their perspective on their own contributions to the problems in the relationship. 
<br>Help them figure out how to respond without being too anxious or withdrawing completely. 
<br>Summary statement:

<br>Must convey the sense that the leaning-in partner understands why their partner is contemplating divorce, and some empathy for this position. 


<br>Once both people are in the room again, and the leaning-in partner has shared their summary statement, then the therapist shares their observations. 

<br>What themes have you noticed, and your perception of how they got to this place. 
<br>Couple does not have to agree on a path at the end of this session, but they may, they recommend that the couple return for at least a 2 nd discernment session before deciding, especially Path 3. 




<br><br>
<br>What is happening in your lives that you want to continue to have happen?
<br>What do you think the problem is now?
<br>How will you know when the problem is solved?
<br>How will you know when you don't have to come here anymore? What will the signs be?
<br>What will have to be different about others involved in the situation?
<br>What is your wildest fantasy about what you want to happen?
<br><br>
<br>What would it take to get your family member (or the court) off of your back?
<br><br>
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that afterward you will look back and be able to say it was a good idea?
<br>What needs to happen as a result of coming here so that this will not have been a waste of your time?
<br>Often in our experience, we have found that in between scheduling an appointment and coming in, something happens that contributes to making a problem better. Has anything happened to improve the problems that brought you here today?
<br><br>
<br>So, what has to happen to get your mother off of your back?
<br>What is the minimum we need to accomplish so that you won't have to keep coming for more sessions?
<br>What would it take to get your family (or court) off of your back?
<br><br>
<br>Between now and next time we meet, I would like you to observe what happens that you want to continue to have happen?
<br><br>
<br>What brings you here today? How can I be helpful to you?
<br>What changes have you noticed since you first made the call to set up this appointment?
<br><br>
<br>When in the past might the problem have happened but it didn't?
<br><br>
<br>How did you do that? How did you get that to happen?
<br><br>
<br>How have you managed to cope, ensure, keep going?
<br><br>
<br>What will it take to move from a 3 to a 4?
<br>On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being absolutely no hope, and 10 being complete hope, what number would you give your current level of hope?
<br><br>
<br>Therapy begins with a description of the clients' problem. 
<br>How were you hoping I could help you?
<br>Asking for clients' perceptions
<br>Acknowledge clients' perceptions, using clients own language as much as possible. 
<br>As clients what they've already tried to resolve their difficulties. 
<br><br><br>
<br>It sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now. 
<br>How long have you been noticing this [problem]?
<br>What effect does the [problem] have on your life?
<br>How does the [problem] impact your relationship?
<br>Does [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?
<br>What do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?
<br>Are you accepting what [problem] is doing?
<br>Are these effects acceptable to you or not?
<br>Why is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?
<br>How would you prefer things to be?
<br><br>
<br>What name would you give the problem?
<br>What is it like to experience the problem?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your life?
<br>What effect does the problem have on your relationship with each other?
<br>What has it talked you into about your family? What impacts has that had?
<br>What effects does the problem have on your other relationships?
<br>How does the problem alter your relationship with yourself?
<br>Is this what you want for your life? Why or why not?
<br>Are we talking about what you want to be talking about?
<br>Is this conversation useful? How is it useful?
<br><br>
<br>Who is in charge, the person or the problem?
<br><br>
<br>Reading between the lines of the problem story
<br>Can you remember a time...
<br><br>
<br>What does it say about you...
<br><br>
<br>If we are not hearing the name, we might ask the family to name them

<br>What would you call that something?


<br>What 'feeds' the problem?
<br>What 'starves' the problem?
<br>Who benefits from the problem?
<br>In what settings might the problem be useful?
<br>Who advocates for the problem?
<br>What groups of people would be opposed to the problem and its intentions?
<br>What are the effects of the problem on members of the family? On their lives and relationships?
<br><br>
<br>Have you ever been able to escape the problem even for a few minutes?
<br>Is the problem always with you?
<br><br>
<br>What was it like to hear what so-and-so was saying?
<br>What thoughts were you having as so-and-so was talking?
<br>It is useful to ask questions that, rather than leaving the field for response wide open, more specifically invite people to respond to unique outcomes and preferred directions

<br>Were you surprised when so-and-so described you as taking the time to let others know you care?
<br>What did it mean to you to hear so-and-so say how important the relationship is to them?


<br><br>
<br>Creating a setting where people can tell their preferred stories to a group of outsiders, who them amplify and accredit the stories that they witness
<br>What stood out for them?
<br>What images it brought forward?
<br>How it resonated with their own experiences?
<br>Where they were transported by the interview?
<br>Situate their reflections in their own experience
<br>Comment on the difference that being part of the conversation makes on their own lives
<br><br>
<br>Opening space questions (unique outcomes)

<br>Has there been a time when arguing could have taken control of your relationship but did not?


<br>Preference questions (preferred experiences)

<br>Was this way of handling things better or worse? And how?


<br>Story development questions

<br>How is this different from when arguing is in control?


<br>Meaning questions

<br>What does it say about you that you were able to...?


<br>Questions that extend the story into the future

<br>What do you predict...

<br>The ethical principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

<br><a data-href="Respect for Persons" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/respect-for-persons.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Respect for Persons</a>:Respect for Persons<br><br><br>
<br>This principle includes two requirements:

<br>Acknowledge and treat individuals as autonomous. 
<br>Protect those with limited autonomy. 



<br><a data-href="Beneficence" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/beneficence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Beneficence</a>:Beneficence<br><br><br>
<br>Two general rules reflect this principle:

<br>Do no harm. 
<br>Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. 



<br><a data-href="Justice" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/justice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice</a>:Justice<br><br><br>
<br>This principle requires researchers to:

<br>Treat people fairly. 
<br>Design research to share burdens and benefits equitably. 





<br>Balancing the Three Principles:

<br>According to the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>, "These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects."
<br>In some cases, the principle present competing claims for resolving ethical problems. (i.e., informing subjects about some aspects of the research would invalidate the research, the principle of respect for persons may be compromised in order to provide benefit)


<br>Federal Regulations for Protecting Research Subjects:

<br>The 'Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects' (the Common Rule) includes a list of criteria for the review of research. These criteria reflect the ethical principles outlines in the <a data-href="Belmont Report" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/belmont-report.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Belmont Report</a>: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. 

<br>Review Criteria for Expedited and Full Review:

<br>IRB members conducting an expedited review, or a convened IRB conducting a full review, must determine the following:

<br>Risks to subjects are minimized:

<br>By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk.
<br>Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. 


<br>Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be reasonably be expected to result. 

<br>In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible range effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.


<br>Selection of subjects is equitable. 

<br>In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons).


<br>Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. 
<br>Informed consent will be appropriately documented, or appropriately waived. 
<br>When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. 
<br>When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. 
<br>For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review, the IRB shall make the following determinations:

<br>Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained. 
<br>Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate. 
<br>If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. 








<br>When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or under influence (such as, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. 
<br>Federal regulations provide a list of criteria that the IRB must determine are satisfied in order to approve research.

<br>Partners in a couple, seeing the same moment in different ways, may engage in “dueling realities.”
<br>Making room for multiple narratives and differences of perspective and opinion, and recognizing the right of each to their own experience, are key aspects of relational ethics. Mentalization is the awareness that others have their own ways of thinking and experiencing.

<br>The therapist offers “construal humility” as a model, noting that we all construe or make sense of our world, but there are multiple ways to look at most interactions. Making room for dual narratives rather than dueling narratives is a key skill of relational ethics in both couple and intergenerational relationships.

The peer helping approach of the EQUIP program is based on the <a data-href="Positive Peer Culture (PPC)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/positive-peer-culture-(ppc).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Positive Peer Culture (PPC)</a>

<br>This is a positive culture in which individuals feel responsible for each other and actually help one another. (pg. 1721)

<br>A peer helping approach alone is not sufficient to counter negative peer pressure, since antisocial youth often lack the skills necessary to adequately help each other. (pg. 1721)

<br>






<br>The EQUIP program therefore also targets three specific 'limitations' of antisocial youth:

<br><a data-href="Cognitive Distortions" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/couple-and-family-therapy/therapy-theories-and-modalities/cognitive-behavioral-family-therapy-(cbt)/key-terms-and-concepts/cognitive-distortions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive Distortions</a>:

<br>Described as 'inaccurate or rationalizing attitudes, thoughts, or beliefs concerning own or other's behavior.'


<br>Social Skill Deficiencies:

<br>Described as 'imbalanced and unconstructive behavior in difficult interpersonal situation.'


<br>Moral Developmental Delays:

<br>Described as "the persistence beyond early childhood of an immature moral judgement and a pronounced 'me-centeredness' or 'egocentric bias.'"

<br>Popular stereotypical conceptions of Martian men and Venetian women (e.g., Gray, 1993)
<br>Suggest the differences between men and women stem from innate biological or psychological attributes. 
<br>Previous studies have suggested men are less able to tolerate sustained levels of physiological arousal than women. This also suggest men and women grow up in differing social worlds. (Holley et al., (2010))
<br>(Smith et al., (2010)) Stable differences between men and women explain why wife-demand/husband-withdraw (WDHW) occurs more than husband-demand/wife-withdraw (HDWW) (Eldridge &amp; Christensen, 2002). Some scholars have proposed that women are socialized to be more oriented towards relationships than are men  (Napier, 1978)

 <br><br>
<br>A mental disorder syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.
<br>Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. 
<br>Socially deviant behavior (i.e., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.

 <br><br>
<br>A balanced therapeutic alliance is crucial for the success of couple therapy; the therapist does not accept the role of judge. If there is egregious or abusive behavior, the therapist takes a stand; violence is out of bounds and the principle of safety first is bedrock in any therapy. 

<br>Nevertheless, even setting limits and identifying problematic behavior is done from a place of concern and compassion. The therapist maintains a stance of “multidirected partiality” partial to each partner, on each one’s side. When clients feel understood and affirmed, the therapist can challenge them. Multidirected partiality is not neutrality; the therapist cares about both partners, is partial to each. But the partiality is balanced.


<br>The couple therapy office must be a “shame-free, blame-free zone,” a safe environment for clients to explore their vulnerabilities and relational disappointments. 
<br>It is crucial that clinicians be aware of their own vulnerabilities and survival strategies, and note when they get caught up in a vulnerability cycle with clients. Therapists need to address unfinished business with their own family of origin.

<br>The extent to which an intervention is implemented as intended. (pg. 1720)

<br>There is a major caveat in previous effectiveness research with the absence of information on program integrity. It is often unknown to what extent programs are actually implemented as originally intended (i.e., program integrity). (pg. 1720)

<br>The absence of significant intervention effects can be explained either as a lack of effectiveness of the intervention itself, or as a failure to implement the intervention as originally intended. (pg. 1720)


<br>Based on the limited information on program integrity provided, there are differences with program implementation and integrity across studies. (pg. 1721)
<br>Without documentation of program integrity it is impossible to determine whether significant, non-significant or ambiguous findings can be attributed to the theoretical model underly- ing the program, or to the implementation of the program. (pg. 1721)

 <br>
<br>Literally, 'something for something,' an equal exchange or substitution.

<br>Lederer &amp; Jackson proposed The Quid Pro Quo contract as an implicit contract that every relationship contains. It is a contract in which people exchange positive things with one another. 

<br>They suggested this kind of reciprocity breaks down in relationships that are ailing, and trust becomes eroded. 
<br>In 1977 Bernard Murstein found that quid-pro-quo way of thinking was characteristic of both ailing friendships and relationships. 

<br>Once a partner becomes an emotional 'accountant' there is something wrong. (i.e., when the thinking is, "I did this for that person and it never got reciprocated,"), then that is a sign that the relationship is in trouble.

<br>Suicidal Ideation
<br>Homicidal Ideation
<br>Child Abuse/Neglect
<br>Intimate Partner Violence
<br>Physical Health Issues or Crises

<br>Inability to care for self or others

<br>Therapists trained in individual therapy generally go through three stages of development when learning to do family therapy. In the first stage, they focus on acquiring the skills necessary to work with families. In the second stage, they learn to apply systemic theory to their clinical work, and in the third, “self of the therapist” stage, they focus on more personal issues in relationship to their clinical work
<br>The initial skills stage is characterized by the therapist trying to figure out what to do with clients. This focus then shifts in the theory stage to how to think. In the final stage, the therapist focuses on the use of self in being with a family.
<br><br>
<br>Beginning therapists report feeling overwhelmed by the experience. Many report going home after seeing clients and crying, while others report that the stress results in headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomachaches, or changes in appetite.
<br>Learning to relax and be present in the therapy room with clients is a good place to start. A solid assessment and effective treatment hinge on the therapist’s ability to listen and attend to the client’s story, and to show the client that he or she is understood. Beginners can learn to replace their anxiety about “doing something” with relaxed curiosity and empathy. This approach leads to useful questions and inquiries, which is where therapy begins.
<br><br>
<br>The therapeutic relationship is a necessary but not always sufficient ingredient for change.
<br>To be effective, interventions must be rooted in a clear understanding of family dynamics.

<br>“I know I should be focusing on the process, but I feel like I’m stuck in the content.”


<br>Beginning therapists are able to develop good insights and hypotheses, but will have difficulty connecting these pieces together into a coherent picture or treatment plan
<br>Many therapists find it helpful to adopt a particular theoretical orientation for conceptualizing cases
<br><br>
<br>Explore how the therapist-as-self is both an asset and a liability in therapy. Many of our personal experiences can become catalysts for new ideas and understanding in therapeutic work
<br>Therapists’ unresolved issues or “growth areas” can become impediments in therapy.
<br>The growth and insight derived from working on these issues can provide the perspective necessary to make constructive use of life experiences in therapy.
<br><br>
<br>Thinking (or even obsessing) about clients is something that tends to subside with time and experience.
<br>One reason for this change is that the therapist gradually gains a greater sense of clinical mastery by virtue of experience.
<br>Therapists learn to balance objectivity and emotional involvement with clients. Therapists learn how to construct an emotional boundary
<br><br>
<br>The potential for burnout among beginning therapists exists because of several factors.

<br>Learning to do therapy can be demanding.
<br>Therapists have other stressors outside of their clinical work
<br>The courses or clinical work may raise personal issues for you as you learn to do therapy.


<br>To avoid burnout, practicing good self-care is essential

<br>Taking time for yourself seems counterintuitive when faced with an overwhelming number of tasks to accomplish, but the time lost is often made up by being able to work with renewed energy and efficiency. (many therapists are willing to give this advice to their clients but have difficulty following it themselves.)
<br>Be willing to set limits. As therapists gain experience, they often will become more willing to set some limits on their availability, giving them some protected time for themselves.
<br>You also need a strong social support network

<br>Being with family and friends outside the field will allow you to temporarily escape the demands of being a beginning therapist.
<br>Connecting and obtaining support from your peers within your program is invaluable




<br><br>
<br>Keep the “big picture” in mind and recall the benefits of being a therapist.
<br>Keep the following ‘reminders’ at hand:**

<br>Becoming a therapist takes time. This is an opportunity for you to be a learner; you are not expected to be an expert. Becoming an effective therapist takes several years of training.
<br>Make sure you take care of yourself. Use constructive means for stress reduction. Develop resources for support from other students, peers, and colleagues.
<br>Self-doubts are normal. Be patient with yourself, focus on the positive, and pay attention to the developmental tasks of becoming a therapist.
<br>Use the skills that brought you to the field. While you are learning lots of new theory and material, continue to pay attention to your intuition, your desire to work with others, and your natural abilities.

- Precontemplation:<br>
- A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior; the person may be unaware that a problem exists<br>
- Contemplation:<br>
- The person becomes aware that there is a problem, but has made no commitment to change.<br>
- Preparation:<br>
- The person is intent on taking action to correct the problem; usually required buy-in from the client (i.e., the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy (i.e., the client believes they can make a change)<br>
- Action:<br>
- The person is in active modification of behavior.<br>
- Maintenance:<br>
- Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is also transitional.<br>
- Relapse:<br>
- The person falls back into old patterns of behavior.<br>
- Upward Spiral:<br>

 <br><br>
<br>Discernment counseling is a short-term process (one to five sessions) with the goal of greater clarity and confidence in the decision about a direction for the marriage, based on a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and each partner's contribution to the problems. 

<br>It is not intended for cases in which one partner has made a final decision to divorce and simply wants a venue to convince their spouse to accept the decision. 

<br>The immediate decision is whether to carve out a 6-month period of all-out effort in couples therapy to restore the marriage to health, with divorce off the table during that time. At the end of 6 months, they can reopen the decision about divorce on the basis of what they have learned about the prospect of successfully rebuilding their marriage. 


<br>Therapy aims for improvement in the relationship (e.g., increased intimacy, decreased toxic conflict), whereas discernment counseling aims for clarity and confidence about a next step. The goal of discernment counseling is not to solve marriage problems but to see whether they can be solved.
<br>There is no relationship homework for couples in discernment counseling, no teaching of skills during sessions, and no enactments of deeper ways to connect.
<br>If clients ask for ways to manage their problems during discernment counseling, we use a 'restraint from change' approach by reminding them that relationship change should not be expected during discernment counseling. 


<br>Path 1:

<br>The marraige as it has been: the status quo, neither divorce nor working in therapy to improve the relationship. 


<br>Path 2:

<br>Separation or divorce


<br>Path 3:

<br>A 6-month commitment to couples therapy (and sometimes other forms of help, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, or individual therapy) with divorce off the table and with the possibility of putting divorce back on the table at the end of the 6 months. 
<br>The idea behind path 3 is to move beyond amibalence about working on change and see whether it is possible to put the marriage into a place that would be good for both partners.
<br>Path 3, as we emphasize repeatedly, involves each partner developing a personal agenda for change on the basis of a deeper understanding of what has happened to the marriage and their role in the problems. 


<br>An advantage of framing the immediate outcomes as paths is that it moves clients past the dichotomous choice between staying together or breaking-up. 

<br>The therapist too can support the idea that something has to change - the marriage cannot continue as it has been. So sometimes the discernment process begins with agreements instead of disagreement - something has to change; the old ways of being married is no longer viable. 
<br>Implicitly we are saying that divorce is not a failure in this process; it is simply one of the options to be explored in a serious way, even thought only one spouse is actively considering it. 
<br>Sometimes it has taken years to build up the courage to put divorce on the table in a chronically distressed marriage. Path 3 avoids the 'in or out' conundrum by offering a provisional commitment to work hard on the relationship for a period, with divorce not an option for this period but something that can be revisited later if things do not change enough. 


<br>Most of the work occurs in separate conversations with each spouse, with carefully orchestrated sharing of take-home messages from the individual conversations. 

<br>The flow of the sessions goes this way:

<br>Time with the couple together
<br>Meeting with one spouse alone (the other goes to the waiting room)
<br>The other spouse returns and the first spouse summarizes key learning from the individual conversation 
<br>Meeting with the second spouse alone
<br>The second spouse shares learning from that conversation 
<br>A check out with both spouses during which time the therapist shares reflections on the process thus far. 


<br>The majority of the time is with each partner alone. 
<br>Times when both parties are together in the room are carfully orchestrated to minimize demoralizing exchanges and to maximize the focus on what each is learning about themselves in the process, rather than what each wants the other to change. 
<br>The individual conversations have both similar and different areas of focus for the leaning-in and leaning-out partners. Similar themes are helping each better understand the dynamics of the relationship (their relational dance), their individual contributions to the problems, and how these relational and personal issues could be addressed in couples therapy (and sometimes with other helping resources). In terms of different themes, the therapist helps the leaning-out spouse figure out which path to take on the basis of an exploration of the sources of the person’s pain and discouragement about the prospect of change. The focus is on making a decision that has integrity for one’s self and others on the basis of a deeper understanding of self and the marriage and how the problems could be addressed in couples therapy if that is the chosen direction. 
<br>The limit of five sessions, although not immutable, creates an expectation of intense work within a limited time frame. 

<br>Going on much longer also makes it difficult for the couple not to expect relationship change and for the therapist to not lapse into doing couple interventions.
<br>We say one to five sessions and not five sessions because clients are asked each time about whether they want to do an additional session up to five.




<br>Some people are emotionally flat when their spouse is in the room and then liven up when our one-to-one time begins.
<br><br>
<br>A big part of this approach is helping clients see the difference between traditional marital therapy and discernment counseling and allowing them to indicate their willingness to engage in the process.

<br>We are interested in knowing exactly what the couple knows about discernment counseling. 


<br>The clients must leave the conversation with an understanding that the goal for discernment counseling is to help them gain greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage. 
<br><br>
<br>We pay specific attention to whether they are currently living together and the status of any legal proceedings associated with divorce. 
<br>After collecting some basic information over the phone, we typically ask something such as, "Can you tell me a bit about your current situation and how do you think it might be helpful to your situation?"
<br><br>
<br>It is important that leaning-out partners feel heard and that they understand how this process is different from anything they have tried as a couple before. It is important to assess whether leaning-out partners have made a decision to divorce or are open to the work of discernment. The following questions can be helpful in determining this:

<br>"Would you say that you've made your decision about the future of your marriage or are you still seeking some level of clarity in this process?"
<br>If they report that they have made a decision, you can ask about their level of confidence in the decision: "How confident are you that you're making the right decision?"


<br>For leaning-out partners who indicate they know they want a divorce and would like to use the session to 'break the news' to their partner, or for those who say they do not know how to tell their partner, you can inform them that this is not consistent with the goals of discernment counseling. You might respond in the following manner: 

<br>"It may be that discernment counseling is not exactly a good fit for what you want to do. The goals of discernment counseling are to help people get a greater sense of clarity and confidence in their decision making about a direction for the future of their marriage based on a better understanding of what happened to the marriage to get it to the brink of divorce and each person's role in that. If you're hoping for a different outcome, like helping your spouse understand why you want a divorce, discernment counseling is not appropriate for your situation."


<br><br>
<br>Usually, the leaning-in partner makes it clear that they want to preserve the marriage, but if not, ask that question directly. 

<br>If the leaning-in partner feels desperate to do anything to save their marriage, suggest that they purchase and begin reading Michele Weiner-Davis's (2002) book The Divorce Remedy. (They learn that they must first look at themselves and their own behavior before the marriage can get to a healthier place)

<br>"Her book is written specifically for people who have recently found out that their spouse is considering divorce. She gives some practical advice on how you can act toward your partner at this stage of the process. There are probably things you can be working on that will make the situation somewhat better without making your partner feel as though he or she is committing to working on the relationship. This approach may be your best option at the moment."




<br>We cannot emphasize enough the value of respecting client autonomy during this process. Never assume that both parties are equally interested in attending discernment counseling. 

<br>Discernment counseling is a way of meeting both parties where they are and not privileging one person's agenda over the other. 

<br>"It is really important that your spouse feel as though they have a choice in whether to come to discernment counseling. If he or she feels forced into it, it won't go well and will likely contribute to more estrangement from you on their part. "




<br>Never assume that because one spouse has told you about something that has been happening in the relationship, the other spouse knows about it. 
<br><br>
<br>The intake conversation must be conducted one on one, without the person's partner or anyone else in the room. The person on the intake phone call has to be able to speak freely about their perspective on the problems they are having and the struggles they are experiencing making a decision regarding the future of their marriage. 

<br>"Are you in a place that you can speak freely without interruptions?"


<br>If there is noise or other distractions, you may want to suggest a different time or place for the call. You also should ascertain whether the client has told their spouse about discernment counseling. 

<br>"Have you discussed discernment counseling with your spouse? What do you think is his or her level of interest in participating? Does your spouse know that you and I are speaking today?"


<br>Avoid the temptation to speak to one partner right after the other for the sake of convenience. It is probably worth taking the time at the phone intake to ensure that no one is feeling forced into having this conversation. 
<br>There is also benefit to suggesting that the first partner you speak with explain to their partner that they have spoken with a discernment counselor and that if the spouse is interested, they can e-mail or phone the counselor to set up an interview. 

<br>In no case should you cold call the other partner, who may not be aware of the initial contact from the spouse. 
<br>Consider using the following script as a guide to the initiator of the phone call:

<br>"It sounds like discernment counseling is appropriate for your situation according to what you've told me. The next step is for your partner and me to chat about their take on the situation and whether they are interested in discernment counseling. What might be a good idea for you is to tell your partner that we talked today, and point her to the website that describes discernment counseling. Further, you can tell them that if they are interested in doing this work, they can contact me directly and we can have a similar conversation to the one you and I just had. What is important here is that no one feels coerced to be part of this process. By putting the ball squarely in their court, they can demonstrate their willingness to do discernment counseling by initiating the call. "


<br>Respect the autonomy of each person to engage in this process at their own pace. 


<br><br>
<br>The phone intake is to describe, in sufficient detail, the purpose, goals, and process of discernment counseling. 

<br>"The goal of discernment is to help couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in their decision making about the future of their marriage based on a deeper understanding of the problems in the marriage and each person's contributions to them. "
<br>"Discernment counseling is typically a brief counseling modality and could last anywhere between one and five sessions. There is no need to commit to all five sessions because each of you would only commit to attending one session at a time. "
<br>"The format of the sessions consists of meeting as a couple with the counselor as well as having some time dedicated to one-on-one work with the counselor. After each one-on-one portion of the session, each partner will summarize what he or she is 'taking with them' from the time with the counselor and share it with the partner who was waiting outside the room. The first session is 2 hours, and subsequent sessions are an hour and a half each. "
<br>"In discernment counseling, we discuss the paths that are before every couple on the brink of divorce. Path 1 we call the status quo path and represents your relationship continuing the way it current is. Path 2 represents the separation or divorce path. Path 3 is the possible reconciliation path, in which the couple agrees to take divorce off the table for a 6-month period of couples therapy, and each one commits to work on the relationship to see whether they can get the relationship to a healthier place. These three paths frame the discussions we have in discernment counseling."
<br>"Discernment counseling is different from typical marriage counseling. The goal is not to solve your problems but to help you decide whether to try to solve your problems or choose a different path. It's not about immediate change in your relationship but seeing what changes each of you might need to make in the future if you decide to work on yourselves and your marriage."
<br>Finally, you can end this portion of the phone intake by asking how this process sounds to them and whether they are still interested on the basis of what you have discussed: "Does this sound like a process that might hold some value for you in your current situation?"


<br><br>
<br>We are mostly concerned with is whether one of the partners is feeling coerced to participate and whether participating in discernment counseling will put one of the partners at risk of IPV.<br>
- "We want to make sure everyone who participates in discernment counseling does so voluntarily and that no one is put at risk. So I have a few questions that we ask everyone who contacts us for an appointment.<br>
- Are you feeling pressured by your spouse to participate in this project? Yes / No.<br>
- If yes, does the pressure seem coercive (for example, is it accompanied by threats with personal or legal ramifications)? Yes / No<br>
- Have you or your spouse ever had an order of protection from a court? Yes / No<br>
- If yes, who?<br>
- My last questions are about what happens when you and your partner get into arguments or fights. Again, our goal is to make sure everyone is safe.<br>
- Has your partner ever done something to you out of anger that has caused you physical pain, bruises, or bodily injury? Yes / No (If yes, get specifics)<br>
- Do you ever feel afraid of your spouse? Yes / No<br>
- If yes, are you in danger now? Yes / No<br>
- If yes to either, I can help you talk to someone at an agency that can help you. Would you like me to give you that information? In an emergency, urge the person to call 911. Ask if you can call back to check on the person.<br>

<br><br>
<br>We strongly recommend a 2-hour block of time because of the amount of ground to be covered in the session. After both partners' perspectives are heard in response to a series of questions, the discernment counselor meets one-on-one with both members of the couple, and each briefly shares what he or she learned in the individual conversations. The session ends with the couple in the room together for a summary of the work that was done that day and any impressions the discernment counselor has to share. If both spouses agree, the second discernment counseling session is then scheduled. 
<br><br>
<br>In this first meeting together, each person is asked to share their own and listen to the other’s views on how the relationship got to the point where divorce is a possibility, how they have tried to fix the problems they have identified, and how their children (if any) play a role in their decision making. They are also asked to provide a brief account of a time when things were going well in the relationship.

<br>These are couples in which one spouse is seriously considering divorce and is reluctant to try couples therapy (but does show up for the first session) while the other spouse wants to preserve the marriage and is eager to start couples therapy. 

<br>We refer to the first spouse as leaning-out and the second as leaning in.

 <br>
<br>A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics. 
<br>Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination. 
<br>Identity politics shifts out moral and political attention from individual wrongful acts against individuals - perhaps motivated by prejudiced attitudes or bigotry - to structural and systematic injustice against social groups. 
<br>This process of recognizing as social and systematic that was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the identity politics of marginalized groups (i.e., racial ethnic minorities and LGBTQ persons)
<br>For all these groups, identity-based politics has been a source of strength, community, and intellectual development.

 <br>
<br>Any oppressive system has at its core the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. This idea gets elaborated in many ways - more intelligent, harder working, stronger, more capable, more noble, more deserving, more advanced, chosen, normal, superior, and so on. The dominant group holds this idea about itself. And, of course, the opposite qualities are attributed to the other group - stupid, lazy, weak, incompetent, worthless, less deserving, backward, abnormal, inferior, and so on.

 <br>
<br>The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society - the laws, the legal system and police practice, the education system and schools, hiring policies, public policies, housing development, media images, political power, etc. 

<br>When a woman makes two thirds of what a man makes in the same job, it is institutionalized sexism. When one out of every four African-American young men is currently in jail, on parole, or on probation, it is institutionalized racism. 
<br>When psychiatric institutions and associations 'diagnose' transgender people as having a mental disorder, it is institutionalized gender oppression and transphobia. 


<br>Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. 

<br>For example, if a policy unintentionally reinforces and creates new inequalities between privileged and non-privileged groups.

 <br>
<br>The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. 
<br>Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. 
<br>On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change.

 <br>
<br>Likewise, people who benefit the most from these systems internalize privilege. Privileged people involuntarily accept stereotypes and false assumptions about oppressed groups made by dominant culture. Internalized privilege includes acceptance of a belief in the inherent inferiority of the oppressed group as well as the inherent superiority or normalcy of one’s own privileged group. Internalized privilege creates an unearned sense of entitlement in members of the privileged group, and can be expressed as a denial of the existence of oppression and as paternalism.

 <br>
<br>The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. 

<br>Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close--the racist jokes, the stereotypes, the beatings and harassment, the threats, etc. Similarly, interpersonal sexism is what men do to women - the sexual abuse and harassment, the violence directed at women, the belittling or ignoring of women's thinking, the sexist jokes, etc.


<br>Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal.

 <br>
<br>A labor acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes that much of the economic progress and development in a geographic area or industry resulted from the unpaid labor and forced servitude of People of Color - specifically enslaved African labor. 
<br>Labor acknowledgements are one way to 'honor and remember the violent histories and legacies of settler colonialism' and to 'collectively begin to acknowledge the historical labor that has allowed our society to get and be where it is today, then we will continue to struggle to reconcile and redress those histories and legacies.' Terah TJ Stewart
<br>Like most modern day US institutions, Solid Ground benefits from the unaddressed legacy of stolen labor at the foundation of this nation and its vast and inequitable wealth. 
<br>We respectfully acknowledge our debt to the enslaved people, primarily of African descent, whose labor and suffering built and grew the economy and infrastructure of a nation that refused to recognize their humanity. 
<br>While the 13th Amendment to the Constitution technically ended 'slavery' in the US, we know that slavery's ongoing impacts are still felt by countless people forced - through violence, threats, and coercion - to work in the US. 
<br>We recognize our debt to exploited workers past and present whose labor was and continues to be stolen through unjust practices. 
<br>We acknowledge our collective debt to the Indigenous peoples of this land whose labor was forced and exploited, the Chinese immigrants who built railroads that allowed for westward American development, Japanese Americans whose properties and livelihoods were taken from them while incarcerated during World War II, and migrant workers from the Philippines, Mexico, and Central and South America who have worked Pacific Northwest farms and canneries.  
<br>We recognize the immigrant and American-born workers of African, Asian, and Central and South American descent whose labor remains hidden in the shadows but still contributes to the wellbeing of our collective community.  
<br>We recognize that our economy continues to rely on the exploited labor of incarcerated people, largely people of color, who earn pennies an hour while generating billions in goods and services each year. And we know there are many other people, too numerous to mention, who are prevented from reaping the true value of their labor by unjust systems and cruel practices.
<br>We mourn their loss of life, liberty, and opportunity. 
<br>We acknowledge that the theft of labor is the theft of generational progress. Nearly all people of color have been robbed of the opportunity and wealth that their ancestors might otherwise have passed on to them.

 <br>
<br>This occurs when the political movements working towards justice for different groups, e.g., feminism and antiracism, interact to exclude or marginalize the interests of some subset of the groups, or reinforced another form of injustice. 
<br>Examples:

<br>For women of color anti-racist and feminist political agendas often conflict with one another
<br>This is the same for people of color regarding anti-racist and LGBTQ political agendas. 


<br>Many times the experience of the dominant group within a targeted population shapes the political agenda. 

<br>Therefore, both agendas fail to acknowledge the additional issue of race, patriarchy, or sexual or gender identity and are often inadequate in articulating the full dimensions of racism, sexism, or heterosexism.

<br>Example:

<br>Domestic violence shelters that do not address the multiple needs of poor women, immigrants, and women of color, plausibly also trans women, e.g., by refusing to admit non-English speaking women. Patterns of subordination often intersect in women's experience of domestic violence. 

<br>Oftentimes one burden interacts with pre-existing vulnerabilities to create another dimension of disempowerment.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Any oppressive system has at its core the idea that one group is somehow better than another, and in some measure has the right to control the other group. This idea gets elaborated in many ways - more intelligent, harder working, stronger, more capable, more noble, more deserving, more advanced, chosen, normal, superior, and so on. The dominant group holds this idea about itself. And, of course, the opposite qualities are attributed to the other group - stupid, lazy, weak, incompetent, worthless, less deserving, backward, abnormal, inferior, and so on. 
<br><br>
<br>The idea that one group is better than another group and has the right to control the other gets embedded in the institutions of the society - the laws, the legal system and police practice, the education system and schools, hiring policies, public policies, housing development, media images, political power, etc. 

<br>When a woman makes two thirds of what a man makes in the same job, it is institutionalized sexism. When one out of every four African-American young men is currently in jail, on parole, or on probation, it is institutionalized racism. 
<br>When psychiatric institutions and associations 'diagnose' transgender people as having a mental disorder, it is institutionalized gender oppression and transphobia. 


<br>Institutional oppression does not have to be intentional. 

<br>For example, if a policy unintentionally reinforces and creates new inequalities between privileged and non-privileged groups. 


<br><br>
<br>The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. 

<br>Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close--the racist jokes, the stereotypes, the beatings and harassment, the threats, etc. Similarly, interpersonal sexism is what men do to women - the sexual abuse and harassment, the violence directed at women, the belittling or ignoring of women's thinking, the sexist jokes, etc.


<br>Most people in the dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards the other group quite normal.
<br><br>
<br>These kinds of oppressive attitudes and behaviors are backed up by the institutional arrangements. This helps to clarify the confusion around what some claim to be "reverse racism." People of color can have prejudices against and anger towards white people, or individual white people. They can act out those feelings in destructive and hurtful ways towards whites. But in almost every case, this acting out will be severely punished. The force of the police and the courts, or at least a gang of whites getting even, will come crashing down on those people of color. The individual prejudice of black people, for example, is not backed up by the legal system and prevailing white institutions. The oppressed group, therefore, does not have the power to enforce its prejudices, unlike the dominant group.
<br>For example, the racist beating of Rodney King was carried out by the institutional force of the police, and upheld by the court system. This would not have happened if King had been white and the officers black.

<br>A simple definition of racism, as a system, is: RACISM = PREJUDICE + POWER.


<br>Therefore, with this definition of the systemic nature of racism, people of color cannot be racist. The same formula holds true for all forms of oppression. The dominant group has its mistreatment of the target group embedded in and backed up by society's institutions and other forms of power.
<br><br>
<br>The fourth way oppression works is within the groups of people who suffer the most from the mistreatment. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, they see it reflected in the institutions, they experience disrespect interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves. If we have been told we are stupid, worthless, abnormal, and have been treated as if we were all our lives, then it is not surprising that we would come to believe it. This makes us feel bad. 
<br>Oppression always begins from outside the oppressed group, but by the time it gets internalized, the external oppression need hardly be felt for the damage to be done. If people from the oppressed group feel bad about themselves, and because of the nature of the system, do not have the power to direct those feelings back toward the dominant group without receiving more blows, then there are only two places to dump those feelings - on oneself and on the people in the same group. Thus, people in any target group have to struggle hard to keep from feeling heavy feelings of powerlessness or despair. They often tend to put themselves and others down, in ways that mirror the oppressive messages they have gotten all their lives. Acting out internalized oppression runs the gamut from passive powerlessness to violent aggression. It is important to understand that some of the internalized patterns of behavior originally developed to keep people alive - they had real survival value. 
<br>On the way to eliminating institutional oppression, each oppressed group has to undo the internalized beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that stem from the oppression so that it can build unity among people in its group, support its leaders, feel proud of its history, contributions, and potential, develop the strength to challenge patterns that hold the group back, and organize itself into an effective force for social change.
<br><br>
<br>Likewise, people who benefit the most from these systems internalize privilege. Privileged people involuntarily accept stereotypes and false assumptions about oppressed groups made by dominant culture. Internalized privilege includes acceptance of a belief in the inherent inferiority of the oppressed group as well as the inherent superiority or normalcy of one’s own privileged group. Internalized privilege creates an unearned sense of entitlement in members of the privileged group, and can be expressed as a denial of the existence of oppression and as paternalism.
<br><br>
<br>It should be clear that none of these four aspects of oppression can exist separately. As the diagram below suggests, each is completely mixed up with the others. It is crucial at see any oppression as a system. It should also be clear that trying to challenge oppression in any of the four aspects will affect the other three.

<br>the ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented (or open to other) in relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important for the client. Culturally humble therapists rarely assume competence. Requires the therapist to engage in self-reflection and self-critique. 
<br>Ability to express respect and lack of superiority even when cultural differences threatened to weaken alliance. 
<br>Approach clients with respectful openness, and work collaboratively with clients to understand the unique intersection of clients' various aspects of identities. 
<br>It is a disposition rather than a competency per se. 
<br>"Culturally humble therapists not only strive to be effective but also cultivate a growing awareness that they are inevitably limited in their knowledge and understanding of a client's cultural background, which motivates them to interpersonally attune themselves to the client in a quest to understand the individual client's cultural background and experience."
<br>Developed a measure of cultural humility from client's perspective, found that it was associated with alliance, and progress, added explained variance to alliance above and beyond cultural competence measure. 




<br>Relational Ethics Perspective:

<br>Take responsibility for the way our communication shape others' understandings. 
<br>Build relationships based on curiosity, openness, respect, and understanding of the mean making process. 
<br>Participate in meaning making in ways that allow for creating inclusive positions. 
<br>Understand how our positioning contributes to the creation of social reality. 
<br>Transparently share our positions of power and their impact on moral decisions that are made, ideally collaboratively.

<br>The attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. 
<br>Biases can be neutral, positive, or negative. 
<br>Operating outside our conscious awareness. 
<br>Based on inaccurate information or stereotypes. 
<br>Implicit biases can impact our decisions, perceptions, and behaviors. 
<br>Actions and decisions resulting from our biases create real world barriers to equity and opportunity. 
<br>It is so important to learn about implicit bias, particularly those biases that don't align with your intentions or explicit beliefs. 
<br>Implicit bias does NOT refer to those beliefs we conceal or suppress in an effort to appear non-biased.
<br>Implicit bias is a took we possess for understanding. 


<br><a data-href="Stereotype" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/cft-keywords/stereotype.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stereotype</a>:

<br>Beliefs that are mentally associated with a given category. 


<br><br><br>
<br>Teachers with strong, implicit pro-White biases were more likely to take a 'teach-to-the-test' approach. 
<br><br>
<br>Discipline decisions are challenging and stressful for everyone involved. 

<br>Differences in discipline show up strongly with regards to race and gender. 


<br>Subjective or ambiguous situations can activate implicit associations. 
<br>Students of color are more likely to receive disciplinary measures for 'disruptive behavior', 'disrespect', and 'excessive noise.'
<br>Culturally-influenced perceptions of student behavior. 
<br>Implicit bias can turn even our best intentions into unwanted outcomes. 
<br><br>
<br>Research is growing around the role of implicit bias in limiting opportunities. 

<br>The race, gender, and program affiliation of the professor did not have an overall impact on the response. They responded better to White men. 


<br><br><br>
<br>It is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to uncover our implicit biases through introspection. 
<br>There are two ways to measure implicit biases:

<br>Examining our behavior
<br>Neurological measurement

<br>Medical brain scanning technology

<br>Tools like fMRIs and the IAT are often utilized together. 






<br>These associations can spill over into concepts unrelated to the 'prime'

<br>Many statistical procedures depend on the assumption that modelling errors are independent of one other. In the xontext of time-series research designs where, for example, repeated observations are made of the same entity such as an individual or country, this assumption is often not met. Where this occurs the errors are said to be autocorrelated.

<br>A somewhat contested notion, causation refers to a mode of explanation in the social sciences which examines the relationships between cause and effect in a set of variables. A relationship between independent and dependent variables is deemed to be causal when, having ruled out other spurious factors, the variables consistently covary in a time-ordered way.

 <br>
<br>The statistical association between two variables measured at ordinal, interval or ratio level. Many different 'correlation co-efficients' are used as measures of association. 
<br><br>
<br>We already know many ways to represent the association between two variables, both measured on at least an interval scale. 
<br>Scatterplot
<br>Covariance sxy = (∑i = 1n (x1 - x-bar)(yi - y-bar)) ÷ n - 1 (𝜎xy for population)
<br>Pearson correlation coefficient rxy = (sxy) ÷ (sxsy) (𝜌xy for population)

<br>The correlation reflects the noisiness and direction of a linear relationship, but not the slope of that relationship, nor many aspects of non-linear relationships. 


<br><br><img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).webp" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).webp"><br><br>
<br>To test whether the sample correlation between x and y is significantly different from zero (non-directional):

<br>H0: 𝜌 = 0 vs. H1: 𝜌 ≠ 0

<br>Directional alternatives are also possible. 




<br>Assumptions:

<br>Linearity:

<br>The Pearson correlation assumes that the relationship among x and y is a linear relationship. 


<br>Independence:

<br>Units or cases are randomly sampled from the population. 




<br><br>
<br>tobs = r√(n - 2) ÷ (1 - r2)
<br>tcrit: Given the 𝛼 level, t distribution with degrees of freedom (df = n - 2)
<br>Reject H0 if tobs &gt; tcrit (or for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit)
<br>Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; 𝛼
<br>APA Style Writing Template:

<br>A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the linear relationship between x and y. There was a (weak / moderate / strong  negative / positive) correlation between x and y, r (df) = (p-value). 
<br>Notice: 

<br>No need to report t. 




<br><br>
<br>Restricting the range of scores on one or both variables will reduce the strength of a correlation. 
<br>If the size of the standard deviation for one variable is reduced, everything else being equal, then the size of correlations with other variables will also be reduced. In other words, we need sufficient variation for a relationship to be evidenced through the correlation coefficient value.
<br>HS GPA and ACT example:

<br>The strength of correlation between GPA and ACT will be lessened if we only focus on the graduates with summa cum laude (weighted GPA 4.2 or above).


<br><br>
<br>Correlation means the variables are related in some way, but correlations alone should not be used to infer cause. A high correlation between x and y might be a result of:

<br>x causes y
<br>y causes x
<br>A third variable z is causing both x and y (or even more variables are involved).


<br>Causality is not easy to prove. Application of complex statistical methods is not evidence for causality!
<br>Causation (x -&gt; y) can only be inferred (formalized by the 19 th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill) if:

<br>x proceeded y
<br>x was related to y
<br>We can find no other plausible alternative explanation for the effect on y other than x.


<br><br>
<br>'Ballpark' estimates for Pearson correlation coefficient r:

<br>r = ± .2 (weak)
<br>r = ± .4 (moderate)
<br>r = ± .8 (strong)
<br>It also depends on the nature of variables, studies, and fields (literature review).


<br>Cohen's (1988) standards for Pearson correlation coefficient r:

<br>r = ± .1 (weak)
<br>r = ± .3 (moderate)
<br>r = ± .5 (strong)


<br><br><br><br>
<br>Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
<br>Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. 
<br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. 

<br>You will learn regression models with multiple predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), in more advanced stats classes.


<br>Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. 
<br>HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
<br>Square it:

<br>r2 = (. 698)2 ≈ .487
<br>This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA.


<br>Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
<br>Recall 'ballpark' effect size:

<br>Weak (|r| ≥ .2)

<br>Weak (r2 ≥ .04 or 4%)


<br>Moderate (|r| ≥ .4)

<br>Moderate (r2 ≥ .16 or 16%)


<br>Strong (|r| ≥ .8)

<br>Strong (r2 ≥ .64 or 64%)

<br>xi: IV data point for subject i

<br>yi: Expected/predicted value for subject i (i.e., the regression line)

<br>Finding b0 and b1 (regression coefficients) for the regression line: 

<br><img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).png">


<br>Best estimates for b's are the ones that provide minimal error over any other collection of b's. Working with the squared values, our goal is to find estimate b0 and b1 to minimize the error sum of squares:

<br>SSE = 


<br>The optimal solution:

<br>b0 = y-hat - b1x-bar

<br>Regression line goes through both means of x and y!
<br>The slope is determined by the correlation between x and y with a scale of y per change in x.




<br><br>
<br>Analyze -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear
<br>Define DV and IV (one IV for SLR)
<br>Usually you'd already review descriptive statistics and correlations before running a regression, but you can also ask SPSS to report Descriptive in the Statistics option. 
<br>Many other options are for MLR only. 
<br>The default SPSS output has 3 sections:

<br>Model Summary (How much variance in DV is explained by the model)
<br>ANOVA Table (Model significance)
<br>Regression Coefficients (Equation for the regression line)


<br><br>
<br>Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts: 

<br>What we can explain by the model (regression)
<br>What we still cannot explain (error)


<br>Regression sum of squares (SSR)
<br>Error Sum of Squares (SSE)
<br>Total Sum of Squares (SSTO)
<br>SSTO = SSR + SSE
<br>SSR, SSE, and SSTO are available in the ANOVA table
<br><br>
<br>R2 indicates the proportion of variance in DV explained (accounted for) by the model, which can be considered the overall model fit. 
<br>R2 = (SSR) ÷ (SSTO) = 1 - (SSE ÷ SSTO) = (Multiple R)2

<br>In SLR, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation between x and y


<br>Multiple R is the correlation between yi and y-hati (always positive)

<br>In SLR, Multiple R = | rxy |


<br><br>
<br>Omnibus:

<br>Comprising several items
<br>"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package."


<br>The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. 
<br>Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question:

<br>Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV?


<br>Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea:

<br>Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)!


<br><br>
<br>H0: β1 = 0
<br>H1: β1 ≠ 0
<br>H0: y-hat = y-bar
<br>H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
<br>H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
<br>H1: ρ &gt; 0
<br>H0: ρ2 = 0
<br>H1: ρ2 &gt; 0
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2)

<br>Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2)


<br>Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
<br>For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value.

 <br>
<br>A statistical method analyzing the linear relationship between an interval level dependent variable and two or more independent variables. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Predicts a continuous dependent variable using multiple independent variables.
<br>Example:&nbsp;Predicting exam scores based on study hours and attendance.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Analyze → Regression → Linear.
<br>Move your&nbsp;dependent variable&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box and predictors to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box.
<br>Click&nbsp;Statistics&nbsp;and select&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Durbin–Watson.
<br>Click&nbsp;OK.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Interpretation:&nbsp;R² = 0.61 indicates that 61% of the variance in exam scores is explained by the predictors.
<br><br><br>
<br>Interpretation:&nbsp;A significant F (p &lt; .001) indicates the model fits significantly better than one with no predictors.
<br><br><br>
<br>Interpretation:&nbsp;Both predictors are significant. VIF values are acceptable (&lt;10). The Durbin–Watson statistic (not shown here) should be near 2. 
<br><br>
<br>"A multiple linear regression was conducted to predict exam scores from study hours and attendance. The overall model was significant, F(3,56) = 15.41, p &lt; .001, R² = 0.61. Study hours (β = 0.45, t(56) = 6.83, p &lt; .001) and attendance (β = -0.28, t(56) = -3.78, p = .002) were both significant predictors."
<br><br><br>
<br>MLR is used when you want to understand the relationship between one <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> and two or more <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. It is commonly applied in scenarios such as:

<br>Predicting Outcomes

<br>For example, predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. 


<br>Understanding Relationships

<br>For example, analyzing how factors like advertising spend, produce price, and customer satisfaction influence sales. 


<br>Controlling for Confounding Variables

<br>For example, studying the effect of education level on income while controlling for age and work experience.

<br>Values above 5-10 indicate multicollinearity. 




<br>Example

<br><br>
<br>The relationship between the <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> and each <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> is linear. 
<br>How to Check

<br>Use scatterplots to visualize relationships. 
<br>Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot. 
<br>Click Simple Scatter. Click Define. 
<br>Move your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> (<a data-href="Outcome" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/outcome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Outcome</a>) to the Y-Axis.

<br>If the scatterplot is approximately linear, the assumption is met. 
<br><img alt="Testing Linearity.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-linearity.png">


<br>Example

<br>Plot house price against square footage to see if the relationship linear. 


<br>Solution

<br>If not linear, apply transformations (e.g., log, square root)


<br><br>The residuals (errors) have constant <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> across all levels of <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> s. <br>
<br>How to Check

<br>Plot residuals vs. Predicted values
<br>Look for a random scatter.
<br>In SPSS:

<br>Request Linear Regression Plots. 
<br>Y &gt; ZPred
<br>X &gt; Z Resid
<br>If the scatterplot shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met. 
<br><img alt="Testing Homoscedasticity Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-homoscedasticity-example.png">




<br>Example

<br>Check if the spread of residuals is consistent across predicted house prices. 


<br>Solution

<br>Apply transformations or use weighted least squares.


<br><br>An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. <br><br>
<br>SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also. 
<br><br>
<br>Click Analyze -&gt; Descriptives -&gt; Explore

<br><img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality.png">


<br>Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. 
<br>Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. 
<br>Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. 
<br><br>
<br>When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. 
<br><br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality-1.png"><br>
<br>The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. 
<br>If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.
<br><br><img alt="Testing for Normality-2.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality-2.png"><br>
<br>In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. 
<br>If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
<br>If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. 
<br><br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png"><br>
<br>If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
<br>The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. 
<br><br>
<br>The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. 
<br><br>
<br>The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. 
<br>
<br>Click Data -&gt; Split File
<br>Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. 
<br>Proceed as above. 
<br><br>Utilize Cook's Distance under the 'Residuals Statistics' Table<br>
<img alt="Testing for Extreme Outliers.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-extreme-outliers.png"><br>
<br>If the maximum Cook's distance is below 1.0, then the assumption is met.
<br>Other tests may give a different cutoff point, but for our purposes we will use 1.0. 
<br><br>Observations are independent of each other (no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>)<br>
<br>How to Check

<br>Use the Durbin-Watson test.

<br>If the Durbin-Watson test falls within the range of 1.5 - 2.5, the assumption is met.




<br>Examples

<br>Sampling is the process of selecting a given number of units of analysis from a population. Although in social research these units are often individuals, they do not need to be but could be households, firms, countries, or whatever. Sampling is often based on randomness to ensure representativeness, although non-random sampling might be used in some circumstances.

 <br>
<br>A statistical procedure designed to assess whether differences in the means of two groups reflect differences in their respective populations or are simply due to chance. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Non-directional (two-tailed):

<br>To test if mean where sample came from (µ) is significantly different from hypothesized mean (µ0). 

<br>H0: µ = µ0 vs. H1: µ ≠ µ0


<br>Alternatively in terms of mean difference: 

<br>H0: µ - µ0 = 0 vs. H1: µ - µ0 ≠ 0




<br>Directional (One-Tailed):

<br>H0: µ ≤ µ0 vs. H1: µ &gt; µ0
<br>H0: µ ≥ µ0 vs. H1: µ &lt; µ0


<br>Reject H0 if tobs = (x bar - µ0) ÷ (s ÷ √n) falls into the critical region (determined by tcrit given the df)
<br><br>
<br>
Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; One-sample t-test

<br>
Pick variable and enter the Test Value (µ0)

<br>
SPSS reports p-values for both one-sided (directional) and two-sided (non-directional) tests. However, confidence interval (CI) of mean difference is only constructed for two-sided. 

<br>
<img alt="6. One-Sample T-Test, Power-3.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/6.-one-sample-t-test,-power-3.png">

<br>Set up hypotheses based on the research question. 
<br>Where does the sample/observed mean lie on the sampling distribution?
<br>Given the confidence level 100 (1 - 𝜎)%, what is considered extreme evidence?
<br>Compared to the critical value, is the sample mean extreme enough to be considered different from µ0?


<br><br>
<br>For one-sample t-test (population σ unknown), we use Cohen’s d to report effect size.
<br>Cohen’s d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ s

<br>Recall Cohen’s d for one-sample z-test: 

<br>d = (x bar - μ0) ÷ 𝜎


<br>So, here sample SD (𝜎) is used to estimate 𝜎.
<br>Notice, unlike z or t scores, effect sizes are not affected by sample size  


<br>Size of Cohen's d (by convention):

<br>Small effect:

<br>d = ± 0.2


<br>Medium effect:

<br>d = ± 0.5


<br>Large effect:

<br>d = ± 0.8




<br><br>
<br>SPSS reports both one-sided and two-sided p-values, but only two-sided CI is reported. 
<br>To obtain one-sided upper or lower confidence limits, run a test doubling the 𝛼 (alpha) level  

<br>This doe snot affect the p-values reported in the output. 


<br>Say if you are conducting a directional test a 95% confidence level and want to see LCL or UCL, you can change the confidence interval percentage from 95% to 90% in Options. 
<br>The lower end of reported 90% CI would be 95% LCL (Lower Control Limit), and the upper end of reported 90% CI would be 95% (Upper Control Limit). 

<br>Any variation detected inside the control limits probably occurred by chance. On the other hand, variation outside of the control limits likely occurred due to special causes. The upper control limit (UCL) and the&nbsp;lower control limit&nbsp;(LCL) serve as boundaries for expected deviation in data.

<br><br>
<br>A one-sample t-test was conducted at an alpha level of .05 to answer the research question: Is OSU students’ willingness to pay (WTP) for Gardyn significantly different from the retail price $899? The null hypothesis stated that WTP would not differ from the retail price. The alternative hypothesis stated that WTP would differ from the retail price.
<br>Based on a random sample of 20 OSU students, there was a mean WTP of $181.9 and a standard deviation of $231.215. Then compared against the hypothesized mean of $899, the one-sample t-test was statistically significant, t(19) = -13.87, p &lt; .001, indicating WTP is significantly different from $899.
<br>In addition, the effect size Cohen’s d was -3.101, generally interpreted as a large effect (Cohen, 1988), indicating that there is about 3 standard deviations difference between WTP and retail price, with the WTP lower than the retail price.

<br><br>
<br>Nondirectional:

<br>Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly different from pre-score (µ1)

<br>H0: µ2 = µ1 vs. H1: µ2 ≠ µ1


<br>Alternatively, in terms of mean difference:

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0


<br>The mean difference is the difference in pre- and post-scores, so a paired-sample t-test is identical to a one-sample t-test, testing the difference in scores against the hypothesized (test) value!


<br>Directional:

<br>Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (µ1).

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0




<br>Directional:

<br>Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (µ1):

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0




<br><br>
<br>tobs = d ÷ sd-bar or d ÷ (sd ÷ √n)

<br>d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference:

<br>sd-bar = sd ÷ √n


<br>sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). 
<br>n is the total number of pairs. 


<br>Recall in one-sample t-test:

<br>tobs = ( - µ0)  (s ÷ √n)
<br>Where is µ0?


<br><br>
<br>Given 𝛼 level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
<br>Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).
<br>Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; 𝛼 (SPSS)

<br>𝛼 level is usually .05 (95% confidence level)


<br><br>
<br>Nondirectional: 

<br>100 (1 - 𝛼)% CI:

<br> ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar
<br> ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x (sd-bar ÷ √n)


<br>To test greater (significant increase in post-scores):

<br>100 (1 - 𝛼)% LCL:  - tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar


<br>To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores):

<br>100 (1 - 𝛼)% UCL:  + tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar




<br><br>
<br>DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS
<br>IV (treatment, intervention) is usually not recorded as a variable in SPSS
<br>Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
<br>Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. 
<br>Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. 
<br><br>
<br>Cohen's d = d-bar ÷ sd-bar

<br>Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test:

<br>d = ( - µ0) ÷ s




<br>Size of Cohen's d (by convention):

<br>d = ±0.2: Small effect
<br>d = ±0.5: Medium effect
<br>d = ±0.8: Large effect


<br><br>
<br>The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. 
<br>The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. 
<br>The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score.

<br>The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. 
<br>The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. 
<br>The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. 
<br><br>
<br>Used for questions about whether the population standard mean (µ) from which we drew sample equals a specific hypothesized value (µ0).
<br>Non-directional (two-sided) or directional (one-sided)
<br>Population standard deviation (𝜎) is unknown: estimated by sample standard deviation (s).
<br>Assumptions:

<br>Observations come from a random sample, and subjects are independent of each other. 
<br>Variable is measured on at least an interval level scale. 
<br>Sampling distribution of the mean is normal, and CLT assures that for big samples (say 30).

<br>How to Check

<br>Plot residuals vs. Predicted values
<br>Look for a random scatter.
<br>In SPSS:

<br>request Linear Regression Plots. 
<br>Y &gt; ZPred
<br>X &gt; Z Resid
<br>If the scatterplot shows no overall pattern, the assumption is met.

<br>Example

<br>Check if the spread of residuals is consistent across predicted house prices. 


<br>Solution

<br>Apply transformations or use weighted least squares.

 <br><br>
<br>The&nbsp;Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)&nbsp;is a measure of <a data-href="multicollinearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multicollinearity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">multicollinearity</a> in <a data-href="regression analysis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/regression/regression-analysis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">regression analysis</a>. It quantifies how much the <a data-href="variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">variance</a> of a <a data-href="regression coefficient" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/regression-coefficient.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">regression coefficient</a> is inflated due to collinearity among <a data-href="predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">predictor</a> variables.

<br>VIF = 1&nbsp;→ No collinearity.
<br>VIF between 1 and 5&nbsp;→ Moderate collinearity (acceptable).
<br>VIF &gt; 10&nbsp;→ High collinearity (problematic, requires corrective action).


<br>A high VIF suggests that one independent variable is highly correlated with others, making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.
<br><br>You can calculate VIF in SPSS using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Linear Regression</a>:<br><br>
<br>Click&nbsp;Analyze&nbsp;→&nbsp;Regression&nbsp;→&nbsp;Linear.
<br>Specify Variables:

<br>Move the dependent variable to the&nbsp;Dependent&nbsp;box.
<br>Move the independent variables to the&nbsp;Independent(s)&nbsp;box.


<br>Enable Collinearity Diagnostics:

<br>Click&nbsp;Statistics.
<br>Check&nbsp;Collinearity diagnostics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tolerance/VIF.
<br>Click&nbsp;Continue.


<br>Run the Analysis:&nbsp;Click&nbsp;OK.
<br><br>
<br>The&nbsp;Coefficients Table&nbsp;in SPSS will include two relevant columns:

<br>Tolerance: The proportion of variance in a predictor not explained by the other predictors (Tolerance = 1/VIF).
<br>VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): The degree to which variance is inflated due to multicollinearity.


<br><br><br>
<br>If&nbsp;VIF &lt; 5, multicollinearity is not a major concern.
<br>If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 5, review the correlation between predictors.
<br>If&nbsp;VIF &gt; 10, severe multicollinearity exists, and corrective action (e.g., removing variables, combining correlated variables, or using Principal Component Analysis) may be needed.
<br><br>
<br>"A multiple regression was conducted to predict Y based on X1, X2, and X3. The VIF values were examined for multicollinearity, with all values below 5, indicating no severe multicollinearity concerns (X1 VIF = 1.18, X2 VIF = 3.12, X3 VIF = 11.11). However, X3 showed high collinearity (VIF &gt; 10), suggesting a need for further analysis or model revision."

The simple model (i.e., mean-only model) is not very informative and has a lot of error.<br>
- Y = 𝛽0 + 𝜀
<br>Our model-building goal is to improve prediction and thereby reduce the error. 
<br>To improve prediction and reduce error, we add a predictor variable (X) to the model. 
<br>This enhanced model is the beginning of a 'predictive formula' that predicts individual outcome variable scores (Y) better than just predicting the mean. 
<br><br>
<br>To use a bivariate regression model, identify two types of variables:

<br><a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a>, or known variable (x)
<br><a data-href="Outcome" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/outcome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Outcome</a>, or to-be-predicted variable (y)


<br>Regression analysis provides an equation that corresponds to a line that best predicts y scores from x scores. 
<br>The model <a data-href="Population" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/population.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Population</a> <a data-href="Parameter" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/parameter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Parameter</a> will be designated with a Greek letter (β). 
<br>The estimate of the population parameter, which we calculate using our sample data, is designated by the Arabic letter b. 
<br><br>
<br>We can predict a person's score on an outcome (dependent) variable (Y-Hat) based on what we know about that person's score on a predictor (independent) variable (x). 
<br>If variables x and y are related to each other, then adding x to our model improves prediction and produces less error (SSE) than the simple model generated. 
<br>Here we have two competing models:
<br><br><br>
<br>You can use bivariate regression to answer the following questions about the pattern of data points and the significance of a linear equation:

<br>Is a pattern evident in a set of data points?
<br>Which equation of a straight line can best describe this pattern?
<br>Are the predictions made from this equation significant?


<br>More questions using Bivariate Regression:

<br>What is the nature of the relation between x and y?
<br>Is b statistically significant? What is the Confidence Interval for b. 
<br>What is the effect size?
<br>How is the y variance partitioned between explained and unexplained?
<br>Do plots of residuals indicate violations of assumptions for bivariate linear regression?


<br><br><br>
<br>The error produced by Model C is the most error a parametric model can have. 
<br>Thus, we often call this model as the simplest or null model.
<br>We call the sum of squared errors generated by Model C the <a data-href="Sum of Squares Total (SST)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/Sum of Squares Total (SST)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sum of Squares Total (SST)</a>.
<br>We call the sum of squared errors by Model A SSEA. 
<br><br><br>
<br>SST is almost always greater than SSEA. 

<br>SST = SSEA + SSR


<br>Y-Hat = b0 + b1X

<br>Y-Hat: Predicted value of Y
<br>b0: Intercept, the value of Y when X = 0. 
<br>b1: Slope, the change in Y relative to the change in X. 


<br><br>
<br>We actually never know the true population value of parameter β; we only estimate with our data. 

<br>Yi = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1Xi + 𝜀i

<br>We will calculate b1 first. 
<br>Determine b0 and using b1.

<br>To estimate the error generated by this augmented model (SSEA) we need to

<br>Predict a score on Y for each subject. 
<br>Find the difference between each subject's predicted and actual scores on Y. 
<br>Square the differences. 
<br>Add them up. 
<br>Y = 10.268 - .776x + 𝜀

<br><br><br>
<br>It is difficult to judge is an error reduction of 64.383 is a lot or a little. 
<br>To help us get a sense of how much error we reduced, we express this reduction in error as a percentage of the total error (SST).
<br>The regression model explained .805 (80.5%, effect size) of the original SST in variable Y.

<br><br>
<br>For the simple mean-only model, 𝛽0, was a constant equal to the mean of Y. 
<br>Since the mean of Y was 6, 𝛽0 = 6. 
<br>The intercept, 𝛽0, is the predicted value of Y when X is zero. 
<br>Thus, if X has no meaningful value of 0, the estimated intercept is not informative. 
<br>Centering the predictor of X to its mean can generate a better estimate because then the estimated 𝛽0 is now the predictor value of Y when the predictor X is its mean. 
<br>Think about the 1 st year college CPA as the outcome (Y) predicted by the SAT score (X).

<br>Y = 10.268 - .776 X + 𝜀
<br>Y = 6 - .776 X' + 𝜀
<br>This new regression equation shows the exact same relationship between Y and X' as we found for Y and X. 
<br>If you calculate the error of this regression model, you will get the exact same SSEA

<br>Values for the F statistic should all be positive. F = 1  means no mean difference because the between and within group variabilities would be the same. The higher your F, the greater change of it being significant (would mean there is a much higher variability between groups than you see within groups)


<br>Complete F Table
<br><br>
<br>Compare the calculated F-value against the F-crit value

<br>If F-value is greater than F-crit then you can say there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups. 
<br>When looking at the F-crit table, the df between is horizontal and df within is vertical. 


<br>Make a Decision

<br>Write up the F-values (i.e., F (1,10) = 41.227, p &lt; .001). 
<br>A bar graph can be used to visually depict the differences as well. 
<br>Example Language:

<br>"We conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine whether there was a mean difference of depression scores between subjects who were diagnosed with depression and who were not. The ANOVA results showed that there was a statistically significant mean difference between the two groups (F (1,22) = 117.42, p &lt; .001)."




<br><br>
<br>The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. 
<br><br>
<br>The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-4.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/midterm-2-4.png">
<br>Where µ = group mean and k = number of groups. If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which is that there are at least two group means that are statistically significantly different from each other. 
<br>The one-way ANOVA is an Omnibus test statistic, and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test.
<br><br>
<br>It is used to test research questions and hypotheses where you want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single dependent variable. You are asking if there is a significant difference between the groups based on a single categorical independent variable with multiple levels. 
<br>If you are dealing with individuals, you are likely to encounter this situation using two different types of study design:

<br>One study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then randomly split this group into three or more smaller groups (i.e., each participant is allocated to one, and only one, group). You then get each group to undertake different tests (or put them under different conditions) and measure the outcome/response on the same dependent variable. 

<br>For example, a researcher wishes to know whether different pacing strategies affect the time to complete a marathon. The researcher randomly assigns a group of volunteers to either a group that (a) starts slow and then increases their speed, (b) starts fast and slows down or (c) runs at a steady pace throughout. The time to complete the marathon is the outcome (dependent) variable. 
<br><img alt="Midterm 2-5.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/midterm-2-5.png">


<br>A second study design is to recruit a group of individuals and then split them into groups based on some independent variable. Again, each individual will be assigned to one group only. This independent variable is sometimes called an attribute independent variable because you are splitting the group based on some attribute that they possess (e.g., their level of education; every individual has a level of education, even if it is 'none'). Each group is then measured on the same dependent variable having undergone the same task or condition (or none at all). 

<br>For example, a researcher is interested in determining whether there are differences in leg strength between amateur, semi-professional and provessional rugby players. The force/strength measured on an isokinetic machine is the dependent variable. 
<br><img alt="Midterm 2-6.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/midterm-2-6.png">




<br><br>
<br>Every time you conduct a t-test there is a chance that you will make a <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a>. This error is usually 5%. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of "making a mistake" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests. However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors. An ANOVA controls for these errors so that the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> remains at 5% and you can be more confident that any statistically significant result you find is not just running lots of tests. 
<br><br>
<br>When you choose to analyze your data using a one-way ANOVA, part of the process involves checking to make sure that the data you want to analyze can actually be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a one-way ANOVA if your data "passes" six assumptions that are required for a one-way ANOVA to give you a valid result.
<br><br>
<br>Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (<a data-href="Interval Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Interval Variable</a> and <a data-href="Ratio Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratio Variable</a>) (i.e., they are <a data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous Variable</a>; IQ score, exam scores, weight, etc).
<br>The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group that is being compared in the one-way ANOVA (technically, it is the residuals that need to be normally distributed, but the results will be the same). 

<br>For example, if we were comparing three groups (e.g., amateur, semi-professional, and professional rugby players) on their leg strength, their leg strength values (<a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>) would have to be normally distributed for the amateur group of players, normally distributed for the semi-professionals and normally distributed for the professional player. You can test for normality in SPSS.

<br>There is homogeneity of variances. This means that the population variances in each group are equal. If you use SPSS Statistics, Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances is included in the output when you run a one-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics. 
<br><a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>. This is mostly a study design issue and, as such, you will need to determine whether you believe it is possible that your observations are not independent based on your study design. 
<br><br>
<br>Your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Typically, a one-way ANOVA is used when you have three or more categorical, independent groups, but it can be used for just two groups (but an <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> <a data-href="Independent Samples T-Test" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independent-samples-t-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Samples T-Test</a> is more commonly used for two groups)
<br>Example independent variables that meet this criterion include ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate, and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist) and so forth. 
<br><br>
<br>You should have <a data-href="Independence of Observations" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/independence-of-observations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independence of Observations</a>, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. 
<br>For example, there must be different participants in each group with no participant being in more than one group. This is more of a study design issue than something you can test for. 
<br>If your study fails this assumption, you will need to use another statistical test instead of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., a repeated measures design). 
<br><br>
<br>There should be no significant outliers. Outliers are simply data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern (e.g., in a study of 100 students' IQ scores, where the mean score was 108 with only a small variation between students, one student had a score of 156, which is very unusual, and may even put her in the top 1% of IQ scores globally). 
<br>The problem with outliers is that they can have a negative effect on the one-way ANOVA, reducing the validity of your results. 
<br><br>
<br>Your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a>. We talk about the one-way ANOVA only requiring approximately normal data because it is quite 'robust' to violations of normality, meaning that assumption can be a little violated and still provide valid results. You can test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which is easily tested for using SPSS Statistics. 
<br><br>
<br>There needs to be <a data-href="Homogeneity of Variances" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/current/glm-2/key-terms-and-concepts/homogeneity-of-variances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Homogeneity of Variances</a>. You can test this assumption in SPSS Statistics using Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If your data fails this assumption, you will need to not only carry out a Welch ANOVA instead of a one-way ANOVA, which you can do using SPSS Statistics, but also use a different post hoc test. 
<br><br>
<br>The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the <a data-href="Type I Errors" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/type-i-errors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Type I Errors</a> rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options:

<br>Transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed
<br>Choose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality. 


<br>There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated. 

<br>Welch
<br>Brown and Forsythe test. 
<br>Alternatively, you can run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most situations, it has been shown that the Welch test is the best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in SPSS. 


<br>A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumptions to fail. Often, there is little you can do that offers a good solution to this problem.

<br>You will have calculated the following results or obtained them from SPSS. 
<br><br>
<br>"There was a statistically significant difference between groups as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 4.467, p = .021)." this is all you will need to write for the one-way ANOVA per se. However, you will probably also want to report means ± <a data-href="Standard Deviation (SD)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/standard-deviation-(sd).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Standard Deviation (SD)</a> s for your groups, as well as follow up a statistically significant result with a post hoc test. 
<br>The general form of writing the result of a one-way ANOVA is as follow:<br>
<img alt="Midterm 2-7.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/midterm-2-7.png">
<br>You should not report the result as 'Significant difference,' but instead report it as 'statistically significant difference.' this is because your devision as to whether the result is significant or not should not be based solely on your statistical test. 
<br><br>
<br>Report the result of the one-way ANOVA (e.g., 'There were no statistically significant differences between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (2, 27) = 1.397, p = .15)'). Running a post hoc test is usually not warranted and should not be carried out. 
<br><br>
<br>You need to report your results. You then need to follow-up the one-way ANOVA by running a post hoc test. 
<br><br>
<br>You need to perform the same procedures as above, but add into your results section that this assumption was violated and you needed to run a Welch F test. 
<br><br>
<br>ANOVA test tells you whether you have an overall difference between your groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups differed - post hoc tests do. Because post hoc tests are run to confirm where the differences occurred between groups, they should only be run when you have a shown an overall statistically significant difference in group means (i.e., a statistically significant one-way ANOVA result). Post hoc tests attempt to control the experiment-wise error rate (usually alpha = 0.05) in the same manner that the one-way ANOVA is used instead of multiple t-tests. Post hoc tests are termed a posteriori tests; that is, performed after the event (the event in this case being a study).
<br><br>
<br>There are a great number of different post hoc tests that you can use. However, you should only run one post hoc test - do not run multiple post hoc tests. For a one-way ANOVA, you will probably find that just two tests need to be considered. If your data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances, use Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. 

<br>Note that if you use SPSS Statistics, Tukey's HSD test is simply referred to as 'Tukey' in the post post hoc multiple comparisons dialogue box. If your data did not meet the homogeneity fo variances assumption, you should consider running the Games Howell post hoc test.

<br>Dependent variable (DV):

<br>Scores being compared

<br>Measured on at least an interval level scale
<br>Often used to compare post-score to pre-score




<br>Independent variable (IV):

<br>The treatment or intervention


<br>Typical research question:

<br>Is there a mean difference between the post-score and pre-score?
<br>Also used to compare twins, couples, eyeballs, etc.

<br>Nondirectional:

<br>Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly different from pre-score (µ1)

<br>H0: µ2 = µ1 vs. H1: µ2 ≠ µ1


<br>Alternatively, in terms of mean difference:

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0


<br>The mean difference is the difference in pre- and post-scores, so a paired-sample t-test is identical to a one-sample t-test, testing the difference in scores against the hypothesized (test) value!


<br>Directional:

<br>Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly greater from pre-score (µ1).

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0




<br>Directional:

<br>Test if post-score (µ2) is significantly smaller than pre-scores (µ1):

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0




<br><br>One Sample Statistics<br><br>One-Sample Test<br><br>
<br>For negative emotion change (hypothesized to decrease), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = -2.393, p = .011. The mean difference is -0.20 (negative emotion decreased after watching the video). The 95% upper confidence limit -. 0585 below zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly smaller than 0).
<br>For positive emotion change (hypothesized to increase), the one-sample t-test is significant, t (33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The mean difference is 1.06 (positive emotion increased after watching the video). The 95% lower confidence limit .7809 above zero also provides evidence that the test is significant (change significantly greater than 0).
<br><br>
<br>tobs = d ÷ sd-bar or d ÷ (sd ÷ √n)

<br>d is the mean difference and sd-bar is the standard error of the mean difference:

<br>sd-bar = sd ÷ √n


<br>sd is the standard deviation of the difference scores (i.e., like any other standard deviation only this one is computed from the difference scores rather than raw scores). 
<br>n is the total number of pairs. 


<br>Recall in one-sample t-test:

<br>tobs = ( - µ0)  (s ÷ √n)
<br>Where is µ0?


<br><br>
<br>Given 𝛼 level, nondirectional or directional, and degree of freedom (df = n - 1), critical t can be found on the t-table (if df is available).
<br>Recall rejection region is outside of critical t('s) toward the tail (s).
<br>Reject H0 if a positive tobs &gt; tcrit (for negative values: tobs &lt; tcrit) or p &lt; 𝛼 (SPSS)

<br>𝛼 level is usually .05 (95% confidence level)


<br><br>
<br>Nondirectional: 

<br>100 (1 - 𝛼)% CI:

<br> ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar
<br> ± tdf, 𝛼/2 x (sd-bar ÷ √n)


<br>To test greater (significant increase in post-scores):

<br>100 (1 - 𝛼)% LCL:  - tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar


<br>To test smaller (significant decrease in post-scores):

<br>100 (1 - 𝛼)% UCL:  + tdf, 𝛼/2 x sd-bar




<br><br>
<br>DV data recorded as 2 variables (e.g., pre-score and post-score) in SPSS
<br>IV (treatment, intervention) is usually not recorded as a variable in SPSS
<br>Analyze -&gt; Compare Means -&gt; Paired-Samples t-test
<br>Move the two variables of interest (e.g., pre-score and post-score) to the paired variable 1 and variable 2. 
<br>Notice the mean difference SPSS computes is variable 1 minus variable 2, so sometimes the sign of observed t can be confusing. However, you can easily figure out if the effect is positive or negative based on the descriptive statistics. I like to enter post-score as variable 1 and pre-score as variable 2 so I can see the change (positive or negative) from pre-score to post-score. 
<br><br>Paired Samples Statistics<br><br>Paired Samples Correlations<br><br>Paired Samples Test<br><br>
<br>For negative emotion change:

<br>sd-bar = sd ÷ √n = .48742 ÷ √34 = .08359
<br>tobs = d-bar ÷ sd = - .2000 ÷ .08359 = -2.393


<br>For positive emotion change:

<br>sd-bar = sd ÷ √n = .95754 ÷ √34 = .16422
<br>tobs = d-bar ÷ sd = 1.05882 ÷ .16422 = 6.448


<br><br>
<br>Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to decrease (one-tailed test).

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≥ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &lt; 0 


<br>Mean difference d-bar = - .2000, SD sd = .48742, sd-bar = .08359
<br>tobs = -2.393, df = 33, p = .011
<br>Since the p-value (. 011) is smaller than the 𝛼 level (. 05), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' negative emotion significantly decreased after watching the cat videos. 
<br><br>
<br>Mean difference from pre- to post-score is hypothesized to increase (one-tailed test).

<br>H0: µ2 - µ1 ≤ 0 vs. H1: µ2 - µ1 &gt; 0 


<br>Mean difference d-bar = 1.05882, SD sd = .95754, sd-bar = .16422
<br>tobs = 6.448, df = 33, p &lt; .001
<br>Since the p-value is very small (&lt; .001), we can reject the H0 and conclude that participants' positive emotion significantly increased after watching the cat videos. 
<br><br>
<br>Cohen's d = d-bar ÷ sd-bar

<br>Recall Cohen's d for one-sample t-test:

<br>d = ( - µ0) ÷ s




<br>Size of Cohen's d (by convention):

<br>d = ±0.2: Small effect
<br>d = ±0.5: Medium effect
<br>d = ±0.8: Large effect


<br><br>Paired Samples Effect Sizes<br><br>
<br>For negative emotion change, Cohen's d (- 0.410) suggests a small to medium effect. 
<br>For positive emotion change, the effect size (d = 1.106) is quite large. 
<br><br>
<br>The pre-video and post-video negative emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 4.80 (SD = 0.926) and a post-score mean of 4.60 (SD = 1.028). Thus, negative emotion changed by -0.20 (decrease) after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly smaller than zero (significant decrease after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly lower than the pre-score, t(33) = -2.393, p = 0.011. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. 
<br>The effect size Cohen's d was -0.410. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a small to medium effect. 
<br>The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the negative emotion significantly decreased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests about 0.4 standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. 
<br><br>
<br>The pre-video and post-video positive emotion scores were collected from a sample of 34 participants, with a pre-score of 3.76 (SD = 0.998) and a post-score mean of 4.82 (SD = 1.014). Thus, positive emotion increased by 1.06 after the video. The paired-sample t-test was conducted to determine if this change was significantly greater than zero (significant increase after the video), and the results indicate that the post-score was significantly higher than the pre-score, t(33) = 6.448, p &lt; .001. The null hypothesis was rejected at the .05 level of significance. 
<br>The effect size Cohen's d was 1.106. Using Cohen's (1988) guidelines, this is interpreted as a large effect. 
<br>The results provide evidence to support the conclusion that the positive emotion significantly increased after watching cat videos. The effect size suggests more than one standard deviation unit difference between pre-score and post-score. 
<br><br>
<br>The results from the pre-test (M = 13.5, SD = 2.4) and post-test (M = 16.2, SD = 2.7) memory task indicate that the presence of caffeine in the bloodstream resulted in an improvement in memory recall, t(19) = 3.1, p = .006. 
<br>There was a significant increase in the volume of alcohol consumed in the week after the end of semester (M = 8.7, SD = 3.1) compared to the week before the end of semester (M = 3.2, SD = 1.5), t(52) = 4.8, p &lt; .001

<br><br>
<br>If you're hypothesis testing, restate your hypothesis. If your t-test is one-tailed, you need to say so. 
<br>It's preferred to report the exact p-value unless it's smaller than .001. You need to state your alpha level (usually .05) early in the results section. If your p-value is smaller than .001, it's conventional simply to state p &lt; .001 (NEVER report p = 0)
<br>Remember to drop the leading 0 from the p-value. 
<br>No need to provide a formula for observed t in your paper. 
<br><br>
<br>Observations are from a random sample, and the scores are independent of each other. 
<br>Dependent variable of interest is measured on at least an interval scale. 
<br>Difference scores (d's) are normally distributed. 

<br>Typically considered robust to violations of non-normality, especially for big sample (n &gt; 30)
<br>If one of the samples is highly skewed (particularly for a one-tailed test), a lot of error will tend to be built into the difference scores. Other non-parametric analyses would be better alternatives.

 <br>
<br>Ratio variables are interval variables, but with the added condition that 0 of the measurement indicates that there is none of that variable. (<a data-href="Continuous Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/continuous-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Continuous Variable</a> are further categorized as either <a data-href="Interval Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/interval-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Interval Variable</a> or <a data-href="Ratio Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ratio-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratio Variable</a>)

<br>Example:

<br>Temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit is not a ratio variable because 0 degrees Celsius does not mean there is no temperature. However, temperature measured in Kelvin is a ratio variable as 0 Kelvin (often called absolute zero) indicates that there is no temperature whatsoever. Other examples of ratio variables include height, mass, distance, etc. 




<br>The name 'ratio' reflects the fact that you can use the ratio of measurements. So, for example, a distance of ten meters is twice the distance of 5 meters.

<br>Also known as <a data-href="Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/ordinary-least-squares-(ols).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</a>
<br>Correlation does not imply causation. With proper literature review and research design, however we can investigate how one variable (x or IV) explains the variability (variance) in the other variable (y or DV). If x is indeed a significant predictor of y, we can use x to predict y.
<br>Still a bivariate analysis, but with a different goal in mind. For example, the school district might want to use GPA to explain the variable in ACT scores and use GPA to predict ACT. 
<br>Here we have only one predictor (IV) in the model: <a data-href="Simple Linear Regression (SLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/simple-linear-regression-(slr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Simple Linear Regression (SLR)</a>. 
<br>Regression means you are trying to find a pattern between x and y. You are using x to predict y. We are only using one. 
<br><br><br><br>
<br>If we square the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between x and y, r2 indicates the proportion of the <a data-href="Variance" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/variance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Variance</a> in y that can be explained by x. 
<br>HS GPA and ACT example: r = .698
<br>Square it:

<br>r2 = (. 698)2 ≈ .487
<br>This indicates 48.7% of the variance in ACT scores can be explained (or accounted for) by GPA.


<br>Recall r ranges from -1 to 1. What does it mean for the range of r2?
<br>Recall 'ballpark' effect size:

<br>Weak (|r| ≥ .2)

<br>Weak (r2 ≥ .04 or 4%)


<br>Moderate (|r| ≥ .4)

<br>Moderate (r2 ≥ .16 or 16%)


<br>Strong (|r| ≥ .8)

<br>Strong (r2 ≥ .64 or 64%)

<br>One statistician movie fan decided to use statistics to study the movie ratings in his favorite movie guide, Movie and Video Guide (1996), by Leonard Maltin. Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film. The statistician used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 100 movies rated by the Guide.
<br>Rating:

<br>Maltin rating (range is 1 to 4, in steps of 0.5)


<br>Length:

<br>Running time (in minutes)


<br>Year:

<br>Year the movie was released


<br>Cast:

<br>Number of case members listed in the guide


<br>Origin:

<br>Country (0 = USA, 1 = International)

<br>Finding b0 and b1 (regression coefficients) for the regression line: 

<br><img alt="9. Test for Correlation, Simple Linear Regression (SLR).png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/9.-test-for-correlation,-simple-linear-regression-(slr).png">


<br>Best estimates for b's are the ones that provide minimal error over any other collection of b's. Working with the squared values, our goal is to find estimate b0 and b1 to minimize the error sum of squares:

<br>SSE = 


<br>The optimal solution:

<br>b0 = y-hat - b1x-bar

<br>Regression line goes through both means of x and y!
<br>The slope is determined by the correlation between x and y with a scale of y per change in x.

<br>The default SPSS output has 3 sections:

<br>Model Summary (How much variance in DV is explained by the model)
<br>ANOVA Table (Model significance)
<br>Regression Coefficients (Equation for the regression line)


<br><br>
<br>Total variability (variance) in DV is partitioned into two parts: 

<br>What we can explain by the model (regression)
<br>What we still cannot explain (error)


<br>Regression sum of squares (SSR)
<br>Error Sum of Squares (SSE)
<br>Total Sum of Squares (SSTO)
<br>SSTO = SSR + SSE
<br>SSR, SSE, and SSTO are available in the ANOVA table
<br><br>
<br>R2 indicates the proportion of variance in DV explained (accounted for) by the model, which can be considered the overall model fit. 
<br>R2 = (SSR) ÷ (SSTO) = 1 - (SSE ÷ SSTO) = (Multiple R)2

<br>In SLR, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation between x and y


<br>Multiple R is the correlation between yi and y-hati (always positive)

<br>In SLR, Multiple R = | rxy |

<br>Recall Pearson r = .318 (weak to moderate positive)
<br>Multiple R = .318 (weak to moderate relationship)

<br>Recall Pearson r = -. 148 (weak negative)
<br>Multiple R = .148 (weak relationship)
<br>R2 = .022, indicating only 2.2% of variance in movie rating can be explained by the year a movie was released. 
<br><br>
<br>Omnibus:

<br>Comprising several items
<br>"Congress passed an omnibus anticrime package."


<br>The omnibus test is used to evaluate the significance of overall regression model. Statistics used to conduct the omnibus test are available in the ANOVA table. 
<br>Many different (equivalent) ways to represent the omnibus test, but they are asking the same question:

<br>Is the regression model good enough to be used to explain/predict DV?


<br>Since we are comparing variances (SSR and SSE), the sample statistics is compared to a critical F statistics, given the significance level (usually α=. 05). General idea:

<br>Large observed F means much variance in DV can be explained by the model (desired)!


<br><br>
<br>H0: β1 = 0
<br>H1: β1 ≠ 0
<br>H0: y-hat = y-bar
<br>H1: y-hat = b0 +b1x (DV cannot be predicted by model)
<br>H0: ρ = 0 (ρ is the population correlation between model and data, estimated by Multiple R)
<br>H1: ρ &gt; 0
<br>H0: ρ2 = 0
<br>H1: ρ2 &gt; 0
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Compare Fobs to the critical F(1, n -2)

<br>Reject H0 if Fobs &gt; F(1, n -2)


<br>Alternatively, reject H0 if p &lt; α
<br>For APA style writing, make sure you report the F statistic along with both degrees of freedom and the p-value.

<br>An assessment of the normality of data is a prerequisite for many statistical tests because normal data is an underlying assumption in parametric testing. 
<br><br>
<br>SPSS allows you to test all of these procedures within Explore command. The Explore command can be used in isolation if you are testing normality in one group or splitting your dataset into one or more groups. If you have 2 or more categorical, independent variables, the Explore command on its own is not enough and you will have to use the Split File command also.

<br><img alt="Testing for Normality.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality.png">


<br>Transfer the variable that needs to be tested for normality into the Dependent List box. 
<br>Click on Statistics. Leave Descriptives selected. 
<br>Click the Plots. Select Factor Levels Together under Boxplots. Select Stem-and-Leaf under Descriptive. Select Normality Plots with Tests. 
<br><br>
<br>When testing for normality, we are mainly interested in the Tests of Normality table and the Normal Q-Q Plots, our numerical and graphical methods to test for the normality of data, respectively. 
<br><br><img alt="Testing for Normality-1.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality-1.png"><br>
<br>The above table presents the results from two well-known tests of normality, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk. The Shapiro-Wilk Test is more appropriate for small sample sizes (&lt;50 samples), but can also handle sample sizes as large as 2000. 
<br>If the Sig. value of the Shapiro-Wilk Test is greater than p = .05, the data is normal. If it is below 0.05, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution.

<br>In order to determine normality graphically, we can use the output of a normal P-P plot. If the data are normally distributed, the data points will be close to the diagonal line. If the data points stray from the line in an obvious non-linear fashion, the data are not normally distributed. 
<br>If the points are generally along the diagonal, the assumption is met.
<br>If you are at all unsure of being able to correctly interpret the graph, rely on the numeric methods instead because it can take a fair bit of experience to correctly judge the normality of data based on plots. 
<br><br><img alt="Testing for Normality Histogram Example.png" src="https://millielynnash.github.io/lib/media/testing-for-normality-histogram-example.png"><br>
<br>If the histogram is approximately normal, the assumption is met.
<br>The distribution curve is normal/bell shaped. 
<br><br>
<br>The assumption is met if the skewness and kurtosis is between +2 and -2. 
<br><br>
<br>The Explore command on its own cannot separate the dependent variable into groups based on not one but two or more independent variables. However, we can perform this feat by using the Split File command. 
<br>
<br>Click Data -&gt; Split File
<br>Click Organize Output by Groups. Transfer the independent variables you wish to categorize the dependent variable on into the Groups Based On box. 
<br>Proceed as above.

 <br>
<br>A covariate is an <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> that is not the primary focus of your research but is included in the analysis because it might influence the <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a>. In other words, it is a variable that you control for to help isolate the effect of your main <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Independent Variable" data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable(s)</a>. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Covariates are used to adjust for variables that might confound the relationship between your main predictors and the outcome. For example, if you're studying the effect of a new teaching method on exam scores, you might include prior GPA as a covariate to account for baseline academic ability.
<br><br>
<br>By accounting for variability in the dependent variable that is due to covariates, you can reduce the error variance. This improves the precision of your estimates and increases the statistical power of your tests.
<br><br>
<br>Including covariates can help provide a clearer picture of the relationship between your primary variables of interest and the outcome, leading to more accurate and interpretable results.
<br><br>
<br>In analyses like ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance), covariates are used to adjust the means of the groups so that comparisons are made at a common level of the covariate.
<br><br>
<br>Imagine you're evaluating the effectiveness of a training program (the primary independent variable) on job performance (the dependent variable). However, work experience (the covariate) might also affect job performance. By including work experience as a covariate, you control for its effect, allowing you to more accurately determine the impact of the training program on job performance.

<br>Helps determine under what conditions or for whom an effect holds true. 
<br><br>
<br>Imagine you are studying the impact of a training program (IV) on job performance (DV). However, you hypothesize that this relationship differs based on work experience (moderator). For individuals with high work experience, the training might have a stronger (or weaker) effect on performance compared to those with low work experience. In this case, work experience moderates the effect of training on job performance.
<br><br>
<br>When conducting moderation analysis (typically through <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" data-href="Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multiple-linear-regression-(mlr).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple Regression</a> with an interaction term). Several assumptions should be met:
<br><br>
<br>The relationship between predictors (including the interaction term) and the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Variable" data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DV</a> should be linear. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot
<br>Choose 'Simple Scatter' and click Define
<br>Plot the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Variable" data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DV</a> on the Y-axis and each predictor (and, if possible, the interaction term) on the X-axis. 
<br>Look for a straight-line relationship between each predictor and the DV. 
<br><br>
<br>Run your <a data-href="Regression Analysis" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/quantitative-data-analysis/regression/regression-analysis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Regression Analysis</a>

<br>Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear
<br>In the Linear Regression dialog, click Plots. 
<br>Move the standardized predicted values on the X box and standardized residuals to the Y box. 
<br>Click Continue and then OK. 
<br>Check the plot for a random scatter (no obvious patterns or curves) which supports the linearity assumption. 


<br><br>
<br>The variance of residuals should be consistent across levels of the predictors. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Use the same plot created for checking linearity. 
<br>Look for a consistent spread of residuals across all predicted values (no funnel shape or systematic change in spread).
<br><br>
<br>You can also use tests like the Breusch-Pagan test in SPSS (via additional syntax or plugins) if a more formal assessment is needed. 
<br><br>
<br>Residuals from the regression should be approximately normally distributed. 
<br><br><br>
<br>After running your regression, save the standardized residuals. 
<br>Go to Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram and plot the residuals. 
<br>The histogram should show a bell-shaped curve. 
<br><br>
<br>In the regression dialog (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), Click Plots.
<br>Add a Normal Q-Q plot by moving the standardized residuals to the Y box. 
<br>A Q-Q plot where the points closely follow the diagonal line indicates that the residuals are normally distributed. 
<br><br>
<br>The observations should be independent of each other (i.e., no <a data-href="Autocorrelation" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/autocorrelation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Autocorrelation</a>)
<br><br><br>
<br>Ensure that your data collection method supports the assumption of independence (e.g., participants are sampled independently)
<br><br>
<br>When running the regression (Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear), SPSS outputs the Durbin-Watson statistic.
<br>A value around 2 suggests that the residuals are independent. Values deviating substantially from 2 indicate potential issues. 
<br><br>
<br>Predictor variables (including the interaction term) should not be too highly correlated. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Ensure that variables are centered (or standardized) to reduce <a data-href="Multicollinearity" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/multicollinearity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multicollinearity</a> when creating interaction terms.

<br>Click Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; PROCESS v
<br>Enter the IV, moderator, and the interaction term as <a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a> s. 
<br>For moderation analysis, use Model 1. 
<br>PROCESS automatically creates the interaction term (Training x Work Experience)
<br>If your variables are continuous, it is often recommended to center them first (or use PROCESS options that center them automatically)
<br><br><br>
<br>IV and Moderator Coefficients:

<br>These represent the effect of the IV and moderator on the DV when the other variable is at its mean (if centered).


<br><br>
<br>Interaction Coefficient (IV × Moderator):

<br>Significance: A statistically significant interaction term (typically p &lt; .05) indicates that the effect of the IV on the DV changes depending on the level of the moderator.
<br>Interpretation: If the coefficient is positive, as the moderator increases, the effect of the IV on the DV becomes stronger (or more positive); if negative, the effect weakens (or becomes more negative).


<br><br>
<br>Purpose: To determine how the IV-DV relationship varies at specific values of the moderator (e.g., at the mean, one standard deviation above, and one standard deviation below the mean).
<br>Output: SPSS (via PROCESS) often provides these slopes along with their confidence intervals and p-values.
<br><br>
<br>Suppose you get the following (hypothetical) output:
<br>IV (Training): b = 0.30, SE = 0.10, p = .003
<br>Moderator (Work Experience): b = 0.20, SE = 0.08, p =.012
<br>Interaction (Training × Work Experience): b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002
<br><br>
<br>The significant interaction (p = .002) suggests that the effect of training on job performance depends on work experience.
<br>A simple slopes analysis might reveal that for individuals with high work experience (e.g., +1 SD), the effect of training on performance is stronger (say, b=0.45b = 0.45b=0.45) compared to those with low work experience (e.g., -1 SD, b=0.15b = 0.15b=0.15).
<br><br>
<br>Below is an example of how you might report your findings in APA style:
<br>A moderation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 1) to examine whether work experience moderated the relationship between training and job performance. The results indicated a significant interaction between training and work experience, b = 0.15, SE = 0.05, p = .002, suggesting that the effect of training on job performance varied as a function of work experience. Simple slopes analysis revealed that the relationship between training and job performance was stronger for participants with high work experience (b = 0.45, p &lt; .001) compared to those with low work experience (b = 0.15, p = .045). These findings indicate that work experience significantly moderates the relationship between training and job performance.

 <br>The relationship between the <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> and each <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> is linear. <br>
<br>How to Check

<br>Use scatterplots to visualize relationships. 
<br>Click Graphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Scatter/Dot. 
<br>Click Simple Scatter. Click Define. 
<br>Move your <a data-href="Dependent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/dependent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dependent Variable</a> (<a data-href="Outcome" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/statistics-classes/glm-1/key-terms-and-concepts/outcome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Outcome</a>) to the Y-Axis. Move your <a data-href="Independent Variable" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/glossary/research-methods/key-concepts-in-research/types-of-variables/independent-variable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Independent Variable</a> (<a data-href="Predictor" href="https://millielynnash.github.io/university-resources/hdfs/hdfs-classes/research-methods/key-terms-and-concepts/predictor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Predictor</a>) to the X-Axis
<br>If the scatterplot is approximately linear, the assumption is met.

<br>Example

<br>Plot house price against square footage to see if the relationship linear. 


<br>Solution

<br>If not linear, apply transformations (e.g., log, square root)
